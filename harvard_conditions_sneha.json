      "What are abdominal adhesions?": "Abdominal adhesions are bands of fibrous scar tissue that form on organs in the abdomen. They can cause organs to stick to one another or to the wall of the abdomen.\nAbdominal adhesions most commonly develop after surgery. Abdominal organs handled by the surgical team are shifted temporarily from their normal positions. In some people, this stimulates excessive formation of scar tissue.\nAdhesions can also form in people who develop peritonitis, an infection that has spread to the membrane that covers the abdominal organs. Another unusual cause is endometriosis. Tissue that normally lines only the uterus grows in other parts of the body, such as inside the abdomen.\nIn most patients, adhesions do not cause health problems. In a small number of people who have adhesions, however, the fibrous bands of scar tissue block the intestines either completely or partially. This blockage is called a bowel obstruction.\nSometimes, an area of intestine that is affected by adhesions can keep becoming blocked then unblocked, causing symptoms to come and go.\nRarely, a portion of the bowel twists tightly around a band of adhesions. This cuts off the normal blood supply to the twisted bowel, causing what is called \"strangulation,\" and that section of bowel begins to die. When this emergency happens, the person must be taken to surgery immediately.\nAdhesions are fairly rare in patients who have never had abdominal surgery. In people who have had multiple abdominal surgeries, adhesions are common.\n",
      "Symptoms of abdominal adhesions": "In most people, abdominal adhesions do not cause any symptoms. Adhesions that partially block the intestine from time to time can cause intermittent bouts of crampy abdominal pain.\nMore significant intestinal obstruction can cause the following symptoms:\nIf the bowel becomes strangulated, people typically develop severe abdominal pain, which can be either crampy or constant. The abdomen is distended and tender when touched even lightly. People with a strangulated bowel usually also develop signs of systemic (body-wide) illness, such as fever, fast heart rate and low blood pressure.\n",
      "Diagnosing abdominal adhesions": "Your doctor will examine you, paying special attention to your abdomen. He or she also will examine your rectum. If you are a woman, your doctor will do a pelvic exam. To find further evidence for the diagnosis, your doctor will likely order blood tests and an abdominal CT scan. In some people with suspected intestinal obstruction or strangulation, the diagnosis can be confirmed only at the time of abdominal surgery.\n",
      "Expected duration of abdominal adhesions": "Abdominal adhesions are permanent unless the patient has a surgical procedure called adhesion lysis. During this operation a surgeon uses instruments to clip the fibers that have formed into adhesions and to remove as much of this scar tissue as possible.\n",
      "Preventing abdominal adhesions": "There is no way for you to prevent adhesions. This problem is one reason that doctors are cautious to recommend abdominal surgery only when it is necessary. If you are having abdominal surgery, your surgeon can minimize the risk of adhesions by using a gentle surgical technique and powder-free gloves.\n",
      "Treating abdominal adhesions": "Complete small bowel obstructions that are caused by adhesions often require surgery. In cases of partial bowel obstruction or complete bowel obstruction without severe symptoms, surgery may be delayed for 12 to 24 hours to allow a dehydrated patient to receive fluids intravenously (into a vein) and give the person a chance to avoid surgery.  In this case, a small suction tube that extends through the nose and into the stomach can be used to prevent additional bloating and to relieve pain and nausea. When adhesions cause intestinal strangulation, immediate abdominal surgery is required to remove the adhesions so that blood flow to the bowel can be restored.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have severe abdominal pain, especially if you also have a fever, nausea and vomiting, or infrequent bowel movements.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Abdominal adhesions can be treated, but they can be a recurring problem. Because surgery is both the cause and the treatment, the problem can keep returning. For example, when surgery is done to remove an intestinal obstruction caused by adhesions, adhesions tend to form again and create a new obstruction.\n",

      "What are abdominal aortic aneurysms?": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an abnormal swelling in the aorta. Smaller aneurysms rarely cause a problem. But over time, they can enlarge, which increases the risk of rupture. This can be fatal.\nThe aorta is the body's largest artery. It carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to smaller arteries in the body.\nAn abdominal aneurysm occurs in the abdominal aorta. This is the part of the aorta between the bottom of the chest and the pelvis.\n\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm usually causes a balloon-like swelling. The wall of the aorta bulges out.\nNormally, the aorta is about one inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter. The size increases very gradually as people age. If the abdominal aorta becomes larger than 3 centimeters, this is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nMost aortic aneurysms are related to atherosclerosis. In atherosclerosis, fatty deposits build up along the inside walls of blood vessels.\n",
      "Symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysms": "Most aortic aneurysms don't cause any symptoms. They often are discovered during routine physical exams. Or they are found on X-rays for unrelated illnesses.\nWhen symptoms develop, they can include:\nRarely, floating blood clots form near the aneurysm. These clots can break away. They can block blood vessels elsewhere in the body.\nSometimes an undiscovered abdominal aneurysm ruptures without warning. The patient collapses and dies from massive bleeding inside the abdomen.\n",
      "Diagnosing abdominal aortic aneurysms": "Your doctor will ask about your family history of heart disease. He or she will want to know about any sudden and, perhaps, unexplained, deaths in the family.\nYour doctor will ask if you smoke. The doctor will check for high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes.\nYour doctor may suspect an aortic aneurysm based on the physical examination. Your doctor may hear abnormal blood flow in your abdomen. Or, your doctor may see and feel a pulsating mass in your abdomen.\nIn most people an abdominal aortic aneurysm is found on an imaging study for an unrelated illness. Aortic aneurysms can be seen on many different imaging studies. These include x-rays and ultrasound.\nUltrasound is a very accurate test for abdominal aortic aneurysm. And it doesn't expose the patient to radiation.\n",
      "Expected duration of abdominal aortic aneurysms": "Once an abdominal aortic aneurysm develops, it is a lifelong condition. Most grow larger with time.\n",
      "Preventing abdominal aortic aneurysms": "You may be able to reduce your risk of an aortic aneurysm. You can do this by controlling your risk factors for atherosclerosis.\nIf you smoke, quit now\nIf you have high cholesterol:\nIf you have high blood pressure:\nIf you have diabetes:\nAlso, exercise regularly and maintain an ideal weight.\nMen ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked should have a one-time screening ultrasound.\n",
      "Treating abdominal aortic aneurysms": "Treatment depends mostly on the size of the aneurysm. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to burst (rupture). A ruptured aneurysm that requires emergency surgery has a higher risk of death than a scheduled aneurysm repair.\nSurgery is almost always recommended for anyone with an aneurysm that is leaking.  Even with no symptoms, a person with an aneurysm larger than 6.5 centimeters would almost always have emergency surgery to repair the problem. Surgery generally is recommended for people with aneurysms larger than 5.5 centimeters in diameter, unless there is another illness that makes surgery unusually risky.\nPeople with smaller aneurysms should be monitored with periodic imaging tests, usually using ultrasound. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends the following imaging schedule based on the size of the aortic aneurysm:\nSome experts recommend imaging more often -- yearly for abdominal aortic aneurysms that are smaller than 4.5 centimeters and once every 6 months once they reach 4.5 centimeters.\nSurgeons have two options to repair abdominal aortic aneurysms.  The traditional method is abdominal surgery. This involves clamping the aorta temporarily, repairing the blood vessel by cutting away the damaged section and replacing the aneurysm with a plastic patch.\nThe other method is called endovascular surgery.  Small cuts are made in the groin over a branch of the artery that goes to the leg.  A special tube called a stent is threaded through the artery to the site of the aneurysm. The stent protects the wall of the abdominal aorta from the pressure inside the artery and can stop the artery wall from expanding and weakening.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if you notice a pulsating mass in your abdomen but otherwise feel well.\nIf you have abdominal, back or flank pain along with a pulsating mass, this is an emergency. It requires immediate attention.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for an untreated abdominal aortic aneurysm depends on its size. A larger aneurysm has a higher chance of rupturing. In general, the risk of rupture outweighs the risk of surgery when an abdominal aneurysm is wider than 5–5.5 centimeters (a little more than 2 inches) or expands by more than 1 centimeter (a little less than half an inch) in one year.\nWith successful surgical repair, the prognosis is excellent.\n",

      "What are absence seizures?": "The brain's nerve cells (neurons) communicate by firing tiny electric signals. During a seizure (convulsion), the firing pattern of these electric signals suddenly changes. It becomes unusually intense and abnormal.\nA seizure can affect a small area of the brain. Or it can affect the entire brain. If the whole brain is involved, it is called a generalized seizure.\nThe two most common forms of generalized seizures are:\nBoth forms of generalized seizures cause a temporary loss of consciousness.\nAn absence seizure causes a loss of consciousness for 30 seconds or less. It is barely noticeable, if at all. The person simply stops moving or speaking. He or she stares straight ahead blankly, and does not respond to questions. The seizure is short and hard to notice. A person can have 50 or 100 absence seizures a day, without them being detected.\nWhen the absence seizure ends, the person goes back to his or her normal activities. He or she does not realize that anything has happened.\nEpilepsy is a brain disorder that causes recurrent seizures if it is not treated. A child with repeated absence seizures is said to have childhood absence epilepsy or petit mal epilepsy.\nAbsence epilepsy can begin at any time during childhood. Most often it starts between the ages of 4 and 15 years.\nIn most cases, the reason for the seizures is unknown. Genetic (inherited) factors may play some role in the development of absence epilepsy.\n",
      "Symptoms of absence seizures": "During an absence seizure, a child is temporarily unaware of what is happening around him or her. For a few brief seconds, the child stops what he or she is doing. He or she stares straight ahead and does not respond to people speaking.\nDuring a seizure, a child's eyelids may blink or flicker very quickly. Or an arm or a leg may twitch, jerk or move for no obvious reason.\nAfter the seizure ends, the child has no memory of the episode. He or she usually resumes previous activities as if nothing happened. There usually is no confusion or recovery period after an absence seizure.\nA child with absence epilepsy can have many brief seizures during a school day. As a result, the disorder may interfere seriously with their ability to pay attention and participate in class. For this reason, a teacher may be the first adult to notice that something is wrong. If the teacher is not familiar with absence seizures, he or she may complain that the child is not paying attention or appears to be daydreaming.\nOutside the classroom, the child's symptoms may affect the ability to concentrate when he or she plays sports or does homework. Seizures also may interrupt conversations with friends or family members.\n",
      "Diagnosing absence seizures": "The doctor will ask you to describe your child's symptoms. He or she will ask how often the symptoms occur and how long they last. The doctor also will ask whether any other members of your family have had similar symptoms or have received treatment for any type of epilepsy.\nThe doctor will review your child's medical history, including:\nThe doctor will do a thorough physical exam. This will include a complete neurologic examination of your child.\nRoutine blood tests may follow. These will check for common medical illnesses that either can mimic epilepsy or trigger seizures. In most cases, the results of your child's physical exam and blood tests will be normal.\nAs a final step in the diagnostic process, your doctor may order an electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG is a painless test. It detects the electrical activity in your child's brain and translates it into a series of printed patterns. In many children with absence epilepsy, the EEG shows a specific pattern that confirms the diagnosis.\n\nProlonged seizures In some cases, your child's doctor may be concerned that the absence seizures are related to a structural abnormality as well as electrical abnormality of the brain. The doctor may order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test or a computed tomography (CT) scan of your child's brain.  Reasons for doing an imaging test include:\n",
      "Expected duration of absence seizures": "Most children outgrow absence epilepsy, usually by their teen years. Before then, anti-epilepsy medication is used to control the symptoms.\n",
      "Preventing absence seizures": "Absence epilepsy cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treating absence seizures": "If your child has absence epilepsy, the doctor will treat the condition with medication to help control the number of absence seizures your child has. They are known as anticonvulsants (also called antiepileptic or antiseizure drugs).\nThe two most commonly prescribed anticonvulsant medications to treat absence epilepsy are ethosuximide (Zarontin) and valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote). Ethosuximide only prevents absence seizures. Valproic acid is a general anticonvulsant that also is the treatment for tonic-clonic (grand mal), myoclonic and partial seizures as well as absence seizures.\nControlling absence epilepsy can help your child reach his or her full potential at school and home. Once your child begins taking a seizure medicine, treatment usually continues for at least two years.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call your child's doctor if you notice that your child has:\nIf your child's teacher complains that your child is not paying attention, tunes out or always daydreams, ask the teacher whether your child shows other symptoms of absence seizures. For example, does your child:\nRequest that the teacher write down a detailed description of your child's symptoms. Have the teacher estimate how long each episode lasts and the number of episodes per day.\nOnce you have this description, check to see whether you notice any of these same behaviors at home. Then call your doctor to discuss the situation.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is very good. Most children with absence epilepsy eventually outgrow the condition without complications. With proper treatment, the child can have a normal life at school and at home.\nIn most cases, there is no long-term effect on brain development, brain function or intelligence.\n",

      "What is it?": "Achalasia is an uncommon disorder of the esophagus. The disorder makes it difficult for food to pass from the esophagus into the stomach.\nThe esophagus is a muscular tube. It carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Normally, coordinated contractions of smooth muscle move food through the esophagus. These contractions are called peristaltic waves.\nBetween the esophagus and stomach is a muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The sphincter surrounds the esophagus. It keeps the esophagus closed. This prevents food and acid from splashing back up into the esophagus from the stomach.\nWhen you swallow, this sphincter relaxes. It opens to allow food to pass into the stomach. At the same time, nerves coordinate the contractions of the esophagus. This moves food into the stomach when the sphincter opens.\nIn achalasia, the nerve cells in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus and the sphincter are abnormal. This causes uncoordinated or weak peristaltic waves. It also causes the sphincter to remain closed.\nThe cause of achalasia is unknown. It does not run in families.\nMost people with achalasia develop symptoms between the ages of 25 and 60.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of achalasia come on gradually. They may take years to progress.\nSymptoms can include\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Tests will be done to diagnose achalasia. These tests will also look for other conditions that could be causing the symptoms.\nTests include:\nThe study is generally painless. Some people with achalasia experience discomfort, similar to what they feel when swallowing foods or liquids.\nEndoscopy is an outpatient procedure. You will be sedated as the doctor passes a flexible tube down your esophagus. He or she will look at the lining of the esophagus and stomach. A piece of tissue (biopsy) may be taken to be examined under a microscope.\nBalloon dilation, a treatment for achalasia, can be done during endoscopy.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Achalasia generally worsens unless treated.\nEven after successful treatment, symptoms may still return five to 10 years later. They may require repeat treatments.\n",
      "Prevention": "Since the cause of achalasia is unknown, there is no way to prevent it.\n",
      "Treatment": "The choice of treatment method will depend on\nTreatment options include:\nMost patients experience relief from their symptoms for several years following dilation. The procedure may have to be repeated. Other treatments also may be needed.\nThe chief risk of balloon dilation is a tear in the esophagus, which occurs in a small number of patients. This requires emergency surgery.\nMyotomy can be done laparoscopically. This means telescopic equipment is inserted through small incisions in the abdomen. Most people have good to excellent results.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should call your doctor for an urgent evaluation if you:\nMake an appointment to see your doctor for an evaluation if you experience\n",
      "Prognosis": "There is no known cure for achalasia. But several treatments can provide good to excellent relief from symptoms for a number of years. When treatment needs to be repeated, it can be as successful as initial treatment.\n",

      "What are ACL injuries?": "Ligaments are tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect two bones. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) are inside the knee joint. These ligaments connect the thigh bone (femur) and the large bone of the lower leg (tibia) at the knee joint. The ACL and PCL form an X inside the knee that stabilizes the knee against front-to-back or back-to-front forces.\n\nAn ACL injury is a sprain or tear in which the ligament is stretched beyond its normal range. When the ACL is torn, it's almost always due to at least one of the following patterns of injury:\nLike other types of ligament injuries, ACL injuries are classified by the following grading system:\nOverall, most ACL injuries are severe Grade IIIs, with only 10% to 30% being either Grade I or Grade II. About 100,000 to 200,000 ACL injuries occur each year in the United States. Although most of these injuries are related to athletic activities (especially contact sports), about 75% occur without any direct contact with another player.\nWomen who play contact sports injure their ACLs about seven times more often than men who play such sports. So far, sports medicine experts have not been able to determine why women athletes have a higher risk of ACL injuries. Some researchers believe it's related to a slight difference in the anatomy of the knee in males and females. Others blame it on the effects of female hormones on body ligaments. Still others point to differences between females and males in skill, training, conditioning or even athletic shoes.\n",
      "Symptoms of ACL injuries": "Symptoms of an ACL injury can include:\nIn some cases there may be no knee pain, especially if the ACL has been completely torn and there is no tension across the injured ligament.\n",
      "Diagnosing ACL injuries": "In diagnosing an ACL sprain, your doctor will want to know exactly how you hurt your knee. He or she will ask about:\nAlso, if you are an athlete who hurt your knee while you were training or competing in a sport, your doctor may want to contact your coach or trainer to get an eyewitness account of your injury.\nThe doctor will examine both your knees, comparing your injured knee with your uninjured one. He or she will check your injured knee for signs of swelling, deformity, tenderness, fluid inside the knee joint, and discoloration. The doctor also may check your knee's range of motion if it's not too painful or too swollen, and will pull against the ligaments to check their strength. To do this, the doctor will ask you to bend your knee and he or she will gently pull forward on your lower leg. If your ACL ligament is torn, when your lower leg is moved it will create the appearance of an \"underbite\" or a protruding \"lower lip\" of the knee. The more your lower leg can be displaced forward from its normal position, the greater the amount of ACL damage and the more unstable your knee.\nIf your symptoms and physical examination suggest that you have a significant ACL injury, your doctor may order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your knee joint or perform camera-guided surgery (arthroscopy) to inspect the damage to your ACL. An x-ray may also be helpful; while an ACL tear cannot be diagnosed with an x-ray, it's a helpful test to rule out other injuries such as a fracture.\n",
      "Expected duration of ACL injuries": "How long you have problems depends on the severity of your injury, your rehabilitation program, and the types of sports you play. In most cases, full recovery takes six to 12 months.\n",
      "Preventing ACL injuries": "To help prevent sports-related knee injuries, you can:\n",
      "Treating ACL injuries": "For Grade I and Grade II ACL sprains, initial treatment follows the RICE rule:\nYour doctor also may suggest that you wear a knee brace, and that you take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) to relieve pain and ease swelling. As your knee pain gradually subsides, the doctor will have you start a rehabilitation program to strengthen the muscles around your knee. This rehabilitation should help to stabilize your knee joint and prevent it from being injured again.\nTreatment depends on your activity level and severity of the injury. Grade I or II injuries may be treated without surgery. Surgery is usually recommended for Grade III sprains, especially for athletes who want to return to sports that involve pivoting and jumping.\nGrade III injuries are also treated with RICE, bracing, and rehabilitation. Once swelling subsides, the torn ACL may be reconstructed surgically using either a piece of your own tissue (autograft) or a piece of donor tissue (allograft). When an autograft is done, the surgeon usually replaces your torn ACL with a portion of your own patellar tendon (tendon below the kneecap) or a section of tendon taken from a large leg muscle. Currently, almost all knee reconstructions are done using arthroscopic surgery, which uses smaller incisions, causes less scarring, and allows faster recovery than traditional open surgery.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if your knee becomes swollen or deformed, even if it is not painful. This is especially important if you cannot bear weight on your injured knee, or if the knee feels as if it will buckle or give out.\n",
      "Prognosis": "About 90% of people with ACL injuries fully recover as long as they faithfully follow a good rehabilitation program.

      "What is acne?": "Acne is a common skin condition. It is caused by inflammation of the hair follicles and oil-producing (sebaceous) glands of the skin.\nHair follicles are the tiny structures that grow hair in the scalp. Sebaceous glands produce sebum. On areas where acne develops, sebaceous glands surround the hair follicles. The combination of the sebaceous glands and the hair follicles is the pilosebaceous unit, where acne pimples and cysts develop. Sebum moisturizes hair and skin. Each hair pushes up through the skin surface along with sebum.\nAcne often begins during puberty. It occurs when sebaceous glands in the skin are overstimulated to produce sebum and skin cells are not shed normally. These sticky cells block the skin's hair follicles, trapping the sebum.\nThe blocked, oil-filled follicle then causes the bacteria normally in the hair follicles to multiply. This leads to inflammation, redness and pimples (pustules).\n\nIn adolescents, acne flare-ups probably are related to a natural increase in androgen hormones during the teen years. These androgens stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce excess sebum. Hereditary factors also contribute to the problem.\nOther factors that can lead to acne include:\nAcne is not related to diet or poor hygiene. In fact, too much washing can cause an acne flare-up to get worse.\n",
      "Symptoms of acne": "Acne can cause:\nBlackheads and whiteheads (comedones).Comedones are enlarged hair follicles filled with sebum. Blackheads are comedones that have pushed through the skin's surface. Exposure to air causes the sebum to turn black. Whiteheads are comedones that have not pushed through the skin's surface.\n\nPimples (pustules).These are inflamed hair follicles. The bacteria in the follicle multiply, attracting infection-fighting cells. These release substances that cause irritation and redness. The follicle then ruptures and spills the contents into the surrounding skin. This causes more inflammation.\n\nNodules and cysts.These are larger infections of the hair follicles. They extend deeper into the skin, forming firm, deep bumps and swellings. Like pimples, they are caused by increased sebum production and bacterial growth, which cause irritation and redness.\nIn girls and women, acne often flares up at certain points in the menstrual cycle.\n",
      "Diagnosing acne": "Your doctor usually can diagnose acne based on a simple physical examination. He or she will look for acne comedones, pustules, nodules, and cysts on your face, chest, back, upper arms, and shoulders.\nYour doctor will ask questions about your medical history to try to identify contributing factors. You will be asked about your:\n",
      "Expected duration of acne": "Acne flare-ups may occur at any time after puberty. They are more common during the teen years.\n",
      "Preventing acne": "Acne cannot be prevented.\nAcne develops in most people. It is a normal part of maturing. However, some people are more prone to developing acne.\n",
      "Treating acne": "Acne can be treated with:\nSome are available in weaker over-the-counter lotions. If these don't work, stronger and more effective gel forms are available by prescription.\nIf these topical treatments fail, acne is treated next with oral antibiotics. However, these medications can have side effects. They are available only by prescription.\nSome oral antibiotics can cause birth defects. Women on these antibiotics who are sexually active must use contraception. They need to make absolutely sure they do not become pregnant either during treatment or for one month after treatment.\nIn severe cases, oral isotretinoin may be considered. This medication can be very effective but can also cause serious side effects including severe birth defects. Strict protocols must be followed.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you or your child has acne that is not controlled with over-the-counter washes or gels. Even small amounts of acne can be embarrassing and psychologically painful to young people. Acne can result in scarring.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Acne can almost always be controlled with medication. However, results may not be seen for weeks or months. Most topical medicines work within four to eight weeks.\n",

      "What is acoustic neuroma?": "An acoustic neuroma is a type of benign (noncancerous) brain tumor that grows on the vestibular nerve as it travels from the inner ear to the brainstem. It is one of the most common types of benign brain tumors. The first sign of one is usually hearing loss.\n\nThe cochleo-vestibular nerve (also called the eighth cranial nerve) is made up of three nerves that connect the inner ear to the brain. One branch — the cochlear nerve — carries hearing information. The other two branches — the inferior and superior vestibular nerves — carry balance information to the brain. The nerves are wrapped in a layer of specialized cells called Schwann cells. An acoustic neuroma — also called a vestibular schwannoma — is a tumor of those cells. If an acoustic neuroma is not diagnosed or treated, it can grow large enough to press on important structures in the brainstem and cause serious problems.\nThe main symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). They are caused by the tumor pressing on the auditory nerve. Although the tumor actually grows on the balance nerve, imbalance is usually mild or absent. Since we have two balance systems, the opposite side can compensate for the slow progressive loss caused by the tumor.\nThese tumors have been linked to a mutation in a protein that regulates tumor suppression. In most cases the tumor grows only on one side of the head and is diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 50. Acoustic neuromas in children are very rare. People with a hereditary disease called neurofibromatosis type 2 develop bilateral acoustic neuromas because they lack the tumor suppressor protein merlin. About 10% of all acoustic neuromas occur in people with neurofibromatosis.\n",
      "Symptoms of acoustic neuroma": "Acoustic neuromas generally grow slowly so the symptoms develop gradually and are easy to miss or misinterpret. The earliest and most common symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are:\nLess common symptoms include:\n",
      "Diagnosing acoustic neuroma": "Because the symptoms of acoustic neuroma are often subtle and slow to develop, they can be missed easily in their early stages. Gradual hearing loss, especially if it occurs only in one ear, always should be checked by a physician.\nIf your doctor suspects that you have an acoustic neuroma, he or she will examine you to look for other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. This examination usually will include:\nYour doctor also may recommend a formal hearing test (audiogram) to determine the type and amount of the hearing loss.\nSometimes your doctor may recommend an auditory brain-stem response test, also called evoked potentials or evoked responses. In this test, electrodes are placed on the scalp to measure the brain's electrical responses to various noises. The test measures the speed that the sound is transmitted through the brain. This test will be abnormal and show a delay in the transmission if a tumor is pressing on the nerve that carries signals from the ear to the brain (the cochlear nerve).\nIf an examination and hearing testing indicate a possible acoustic neuroma, your doctor may order additional tests to confirm the diagnosis. Most commonly, he or she will recommend a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. MRI uses magnetic waves to create pictures of structures inside the body. These pictures can show whether you have an acoustic neuroma, how big the tumor is, and where it is located. An MRI can detect tumors as small as 2 mm.\n",
      "Expected duration of acoustic neuroma": "Most acoustic neuromas grow slowly, taking years before they become large enough to cause symptoms. The average growth rate is 2 mm/year. A few acoustic neuromas do grow at a faster rate. At least 10% of all acoustic neuromas, once found, do not show further growth. There is no way to tell the growth rate of any tumor except by periodic MRI scans.\n",
      "Preventing acoustic neuroma": "There is no known prevention for acoustic neuromas.\n",
      "Treating acoustic neuroma": "There are three ways to treat acoustic neuromas — observation, radiation and surgery.\nAt least 10% of acoustic neuromas do not show signs of growth after they are found. Since the tumor is very slow-growing and benign, having a follow-up MRI scan and an audiogram in six and 12 months is a safe alternative to immediate intervention. If no changes are found, yearly checkups afterward are adequate to monitor the tumor. If the tumor does not show signs of growth, intervention is not necessary. The risk of this approach is that further permanent hearing loss can occur during this observation period.\nIf the tumor shows signs of growth or is pressing on the brainstem, radiation or surgery are necessary. The choice between the two depends upon a lot of factors best discussed with your surgeon and radiation oncologist. Factors such as size and location of the tumor, related health issues, age, and hearing loss all need to be considered.\nIf surgery is necessary it is usually performed by a team consisting of a neurosurgeon and an otologist. The neurosurgeon removes the part of the tumor around the brain and the otologist removes the part of the tumor in the ear. Hospitalization is usually for four to seven days after surgery. Possible complications of surgery include loss of hearing and injury to the facial nerve, the nerve that supplies motion to the face.\nRadiation is an alternative to surgery. It does not remove the tumor, but many times it can stop the tumor growth or cause the tumor to shrink. Radiation can be delivered in a number of different ways — gamma knife, stereotactic radiosurgery, proton beam radiation, and fractionated stereotactic surgery. The choice is made after discussion with the radiation oncologist. Possible complications of radiation include loss of hearing, facial nerve injury, and continued growth of the tumor.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your physician if you develop new hearing loss or tinnitus, particularly if the hearing loss or tinnitus is only on one side.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Acoustic neuromas are not cancerous (malignant) and do not spread to other parts of the body. Timely diagnosis and proper treatment can minimize the losses that they cause and prevent any shortening of ones lifespan.\n",

      "What is acute bronchitis?": "Acute bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, the hollow air passages that connect the lungs to the windpipe (trachea). The inflammation can be caused by an infection or by other factors that irritate the airways, such as cigarette smoking, allergies and exposure to fumes from some chemicals.\n\nAcute bronchitis caused by an infection usually starts with an upper respiratory illness, such as the common cold or flu (influenza), that spreads from your nose and throat down into the airways. Acute bronchitis does not affect the lungs like pneumonia does. Pneumonia shows up on a chest X-ray, but acute bronchitis usually does not.\nA respiratory virus causes about 90% of cases of acute bronchitis.\n",
      "Symptoms of acute bronchitis": "The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough. The cough can be dry or it can produce sputum, the mucus-like substance brought up from the lungs. The sputum may be clear, cloudy, brown, yellow or greenish. Other symptoms can include wheezing, chest tightness or pain, shortness of breath, sore throat, nasal congestion, fever and tiredness.\n",
      "Diagnosing acute bronchitis": "To diagnose acute bronchitis, your health care provider will ask about your medical history, especially whether you recently have had an upper respiratory infection. Your doctor also will listen to your chest with a stethoscope to try to detect sounds of wheezing and airways clogged with mucous. The level of oxygen in your blood may be tested using a small device that closes gently over a finger. If your health care provider hears any suspicious lung sounds during the physical examination, or if your oxygen level is lower than normal, he or she may order a chest X-ray to check for pneumonia.\n",
      "Expected duration of acute bronchitis": "Most cases of acute bronchitis go away without treatment within five days, although coughing usually lasts seven to 10 days. In some cases, coughing continues for weeks after the infection is gone because the bronchial linings are still irritated and may become narrow, as in asthma. Inhalers can help to treat the cough in these cases. When bronchitis comes back frequently or occurs most days of a month for at least three months of a year for two years, it is called chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis occurs most often in current and former smokers.\n",
      "Preventing acute bronchitis": "There is no way to prevent all cases of acute bronchitis. However, the risk of bronchitis and complications can be reduced by not smoking and by getting flu, RSV and COVID vaccines to reduce the risk of getting one of these respiratory viruses, which can lead to acute bronchitis.\n",
      "Treating acute bronchitis": "Most cases of acute bronchitis do not require medical treatment. People diagnosed with acute bronchitis will be told to rest and drink plenty of fluids to keep the mucus thin, watery and easy to cough up. Warm, moist air also can loosen sputum and make coughing and breathing easier. Because of that, many physicians recommend at least one of the following for people with bronchitis:\nIf you have a fever, most physicians will recommend taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to reduce fever. However, aspirin should not be given to children under age 19 to avoid the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious, potentially fatal illness that can occur when a child with a fever takes aspirin.\nPeople who smoke should avoid smoking during the illness to reduce irritation to the airways.\nIf bronchitis is caused by a bacterial infection and doesn't get better on its own, an antibiotic may be prescribed. Antibiotics will be given only when there is a strong suspicion that the bronchitis is caused by a bacterial infection. That's because of rising concerns about antibiotic resistance, in which bacteria evolve in ways that allow them to survive antibiotics. This problem is increasing and is caused, in part, by antibiotics being used incorrectly and when they are not needed.\nIn some cases, doctors may prescribe a bronchodilator, an inhaled medication that helps the airways to open. These are the same medications used by some people with asthma to ease breathing during an asthma attack.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should call your doctor if:\nAny time you have chest pain, you should call your doctor for advice. Chest pain can come from the heart as well as the lungs.\nPeople at high risk of complications from acute bronchitis — such as infants, the elderly or people with chronic lung or heart disease — should call a physician at the first signs of bronchitis.\nSymptoms of acute bronchitis are often similar to symptoms of mild asthma. People who have frequent bouts of acute bronchitis should make an appointment with a physician to see if they might have undiagnosed asthma or chronic bronchitis.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In an average, healthy person, acute bronchitis typically clears up quickly on its own or with antibiotic treatment. Some people, including the elderly, infants, smokers or people with heart or lung disorders, are at higher risk of developing complications from acute bronchitis.\n",

      "What is acute pancreatitis?": "Acute pancreatitis is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas.\nThe pancreas is located in the upper part of the abdomen, behind the stomach. It produces digestive enzymes and hormones.\nIn pancreatitis, enzymes that normally are released into the digestive tract begin to damage the pancreas itself. The organ becomes swollen and inflamed. More enzymes are released into the surrounding tissues and bloodstream.\nThe most common causes of acute pancreatitis are\nAlcohol-related pancreatitis.Most people who drink alcohol never develop pancreatitis. But certain people will develop pancreatitis after drinking large amounts of alcohol. Alcohol use may be over a period of time or in a single binge. Alcohol combined with smoking increases the risk of acute pancreatitis.\nGallstone pancreatitis.Gallstones that escape from the gallbladder can block the pancreatic duct. (The pancreatic duct delivers digestive enzymes from the pancreas to the small intestine.) When the pancreatic duct becomes blocked, enzymes can't flow properly. They can back up into the pancreas. This causes the pancreas to become inflamed.\nERCP-related pancreatitis.Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a medical procedure used to evaluate the bile and pancreatic ducts and help open any blockages. ERCP is performed through an endoscope. This is a flexible tube with a small camera and a light on one end and an eyepiece on the other. ERCP is used to identify stones and tumors and to view ducts in the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.\nOther factors that sometimes can cause pancreatitis include\nIn many cases, no cause can be found.\n",
      "Symptoms of acute pancreatitis": "The most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is upper abdominal pain. It can range from tolerable to severe.\nThe pain usually occurs in the middle of the body, just under the ribs. But it is sometimes felt on either the left or right side. This is a steady, drilling, or \"boring\" pain. It can radiate to the back, flank, chest, or lower abdomen.\nPain reaches a maximum intensity quickly, often within 30 minutes. In alcohol-induced pancreatitis, the pain tends to begin one to three days after a binge.\nIt may be difficult to find a comfortable position. Bending over or lying on your side may reduce the pain. Eating usually makes the pain worse.\nOther symptoms of acute pancreatitis include\nIn severe cases, fever, difficulty breathing, weakness, and shock may develop.\n",
      "Diagnosing acute pancreatitis": "Your doctor will diagnose acute pancreatitis based on\nBlood tests usually reveal high levels of two pancreatic enzymes.\nIn most cases, people suspected of having pancreatitis undergo an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. The scan can identify swelling of the pancreas and accumulation of fluid in the abdomen.\nThe scan also may show whether you have pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts are pockets of fluid created by escaped digestive enzymes. They develop in some cases of severe pancreatitis or after repeated attacks.\nIf gallstones are suspected, an ultrasound examination of the gallbladder is usually performed.\n",
      "Expected duration of acute pancreatitis": "Mild to moderate pancreatitis often goes away on its own within one week. But severe cases can last several weeks.\nIf significant damage is done to the pancreas in a single severe attack or several repeat attacks, chronic pancreatitis can develop.\n",
      "Preventing acute pancreatitis": "Avoiding heavy alcohol use will help to prevent pancreatitis. Anyone who already has had one episode of pancreatitis caused by alcohol should stop drinking entirely. This is crucial to prevent the condition from coming back or becoming chronic.\nMost first episodes of acute pancreatitis that are not related to alcohol use cannot be prevented. However, taking steps to prevent gallstones may help to prevent gallstone-related acute pancreatitis. To help prevent gallstones, maintain a normal weight and avoid rapid weight loss.\nIf the cause is gallstones, gallbladder surgery will usually be recommended to prevent future attacks. When a medication is the likely cause, it will be stopped if possible.\n",
      "Treating acute pancreatitis": "If you suspect you have acute pancreatitis, you need to seek urgent medical care. Most people who develop pancreatitis are admitted to the hospital. They are treated with pain relievers and intravenous fluids.\nYou will usually be able to start taking clear liquids once the pain is controlled and you are not vomiting. In most cases, nothing can be done to speed healing or shorten an episode. If the episode is prolonged, and a patient cannot eat for longer than a week, nutrition may be given intravenously.\nIf the damaged pancreas becomes infected with bacteria, antibiotics may be prescribed, but only if the damaged pancreas becomes infected with bacteria.\nIf you have an attack of pancreatitis caused by gallstones, you may need to have an ERCP. During the test, the doctor may make a tiny cut into the opening of the bile duct to treat current or future blockage. You will likely be advised to have your gallbladder removed, often before leaving the hospital.\nSurgery also may be needed to\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor or go to the nearest hospital emergency room if you have\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, acute pancreatitis goes away on its own after a couple of days. There are usually no complications or further problems.\nA small percentage of patients develop complications. These may include a pseudocyst or abscess in the pancreas. They may require monitoring or additional treatment.\nPancreatitis caused by heavy drinking is likely to come back if drinking continues. Over time, permanent damage may be done to the pancreas. A chronic form of the disease may develop.\n",

      "What is acute prostatitis?": "The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that sits below the bladder in men. This gland makes fluid that mixes with sperm to form semen. Because the prostate surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder), conditions that cause the prostate to swell or enlarge may press on the urethra and cause pain or problems with urination.\n\nProstatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland. Acute prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland that results in sudden onset of symptoms. Acute prostatitis is caused by an infection, usually by bacteria that get into the prostate by traveling up the urethra. Some of these bacteria are the normal germs that live on and inside your body. Other infections are transmitted through sexual contact.\nMost men who will develop prostatitis have a normal prostate gland, although the infection may be more common in older men as the gland gets larger with age. There is no known link between prostatitis and prostate cancer.\n",
      "Symptoms of acute prostatitis": "Typical symptoms of acute prostatitis include:\n",
      "Diagnosing acute prostatitis": "Your doctor will examine your prostate by gently inserting a finger into your rectum. When the prostate is infected, it usually feels swollen. When slight pressure is put on the gland, you may experience pain or a severe need to urinate. Your doctor also will do a general exam to make sure that infection has not spread to other organs, such as the kidneys.\n\nA next step will be to examine a urine specimen for evidence of infection, such as white blood cells and bacteria. In a typical case of acute prostatitis, the urine will contain white blood cells. You may also have blood tests to check your kidney function and blood cell count. Your doctor may order an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan if there is concern that your swollen prostate is causing urinary obstruction.\n",
      "Expected duration of acute prostatitis": "If treated promptly, the symptoms of prostatitis usually begin to improve within 24 to 48 hours. In more severe cases, symptoms of infection may linger for more than a week.\n",
      "Preventing acute prostatitis": "Most cases of prostatitis cannot be prevented. However, if an infection is caught early, it is more likely to respond quickly to treatment. In addition, some cases of prostatitis are caused by sexually transmitted bacteria. Many of these infections can be prevented by practicing safe sex.\n",
      "Treating acute prostatitis": "Acute prostatitis is treated with antibiotics. In severe cases, antibiotics will be given intravenously (into a vein). In less severe cases, antibiotics can be taken orally. Because it is difficult for antibiotics to get from the bloodstream into the prostate, these medications often are prescribed for three or more weeks.\nIf you are severely ill with prostatitis, your doctor may admit you to a hospital to give you intravenous antibiotics and make sure your vital signs remain stable. Usually, a stay of only a few days is needed. If the prostate is very swollen, it may be necessary to insert a catheter to allow urine to drain. This catheter may need to be left in place for up to a week, but as the infection comes under control, you should be able to urinate normally again.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call a health care professional if you develop:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most cases of acute prostatitis respond promptly to treatment. Your doctor may recommend a prolonged course of antibiotics. Even if you start to feel better, it is important to complete the full treatment. Symptoms of irritation or hesitancy as you pass urine may linger for a while, but eventually should go away completely.\n",

      "What is acute sinusitis?": "Sinuses are air-filled spaces behind the bones of the upper face: between the eyes and behind the forehead, nose and cheeks. The lining of the sinuses are made up of cells with tiny hairs on their surfaces called cilia.  Other cells in the lining produce mucus.  The mucus traps germs and pollutants and the cilia push the mucus out through narrow sinus openings into the nose.\nWhen the sinuses become inflamed or infected, the mucus thickens and clogs the openings to one or more sinuses. Fluid builds up inside the sinuses causing increased pressure. Also bacteria can become trapped, multiply and infect the lining. This is sinusitis.\n\nSinusitis is can be chronic (long-lasting or frequently returning) or acute. Acute sinusitis lasts three weeks or less and the person should have no more than three episodes per year. Acute sinusitis is extremely common. It usually is caused by an upper respiratory viral infection.\n\nThe inflammation and swelling of the lining of the sinuses can be triggered by\n",
      "Symptoms of acute sinusitis": "Common symptoms of acute sinusitis include nasal congestion, thick green nasal discharge, fever, headache, tiredness and facial pain. Some symptoms depend on which sinus is inflamed. For example:\n",
      "Diagnosing sinusitis": "A sinus infection can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages because it can mimic a common cold. Both can cause nasal congestion and fatigue. However, a common cold usually will improve in five to seven days, while an untreated sinus infection can last three weeks or longer. Sinus infections also are more likely to cause a green nasal discharge, fever and facial pain.\nYour doctor will diagnose acute sinusitis based on your symptoms, medical history and a simple office examination. The doctor will ask about your symptoms and how long they last, look into your ears, nose and throat, and may tap or press on your face to test for tenderness over specific sinuses.\nIf your doctor is uncertain of your diagnosis, he or she may use other methods to see inside the sinuses. Some physicians may insert a nasopharyngoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a camera on the end) into your nose to look for abnormalities. X-rays and computed tomography scans (CT) also can provide a look at the sinuses, especially those that are deep within the head.\n",
      "Expected duration of acute sinusitis": "By definition, acute sinus infections resolve within three weeks. Infections that last longer than three weeks are considered chronic sinusitis.\n",
      "Preventing acute sinusitis": "There are some measures you can take to decrease your risk of developing sinusitis. If you smoke cigarettes, you should quit. The smoke can irritate nasal passageways and increase the likelihood of infection. Nasal allergies can trigger sinus infections, too. By identifying the allergen (the substance causing the allergic reaction) and avoiding it, you can help prevent sinusitis.\nIf you have congestion from a cold or allergies, the following may help to reduce the risk of developing sinusitis:\nSome doctors advise periodic home nasal washings to clear secretions. This may help prevent, and also treat, sinus infections.\n",
      "Treating acute sinusitis": "Many sinus infections improve without treatment. However, several medications may speed recovery and reduce the chance that an infection will become chronic.\nDecongestants— Congestion often triggers sinus infections, and decongestants can open the sinuses and allow them to drain. Several are available:\nAntihistamines— These medications help to relieve the symptoms of nasal allergies that lead to inflammation and infections. However, some doctors advise against using antihistamines during a sinus infection because they can cause excessive drying and slow the drainage process. Many over-the-counter antihistamines are available as brand name products and less expensive generic versions.\nNasal steroids— Anti-inflammatory sprays such as mometasone (Nasonex) and fluticasone (Flonase) reduce swelling of nasal membranes. Like antihistamines, nasal steroids can be most useful for those who have nasal allergies. Nasal steroids tend to produce less drying than antihistamines. Unlike nasal decongestants, nasal steroids can be used for prolonged periods.\nSaline nasal sprays— These salt-water sprays are safe to use and can provide some relief by adding moisture to the nasal passages, thinning mucus secretions and helping to flush out any bacteria that may be present.\nPain relievers— Acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) or naproxen (Aleve) can be taken sinus pain.\nAntibiotics— Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if he or she suspects that a bacterial infection is causing your sinusitis.\nNot all cases of sinusitis require antibiotic treatment: Talk with your doctor about whether an antibiotic is right for you. Keep in mind that antibiotics can cause side effects, such as allergic reactions, rash and diarrhea. In addition, overusing antibiotics eventually leads to the spread of bacteria that no longer can be killed by the most commonly prescribed antibiotics.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a doctor if you experience facial pain along with a headache and fever, cold symptoms that last longer than seven to 10 days, or persistent green discharge from the nose. If your symptoms don't improve within a week of beginning treatment, call your doctor. Call sooner if symptoms are getting worse.\nIf you have repeated bouts of acute sinusitis, you may have allergies or another treatable cause of sinus congestion. Ask your doctor for advice.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis for acute sinusitis is very good. Most cases will go away within one to two weeks, often without antibiotics.\n",

      "What are age spots?": "As you age, years of being in the sun start to add up. Age spots (also called liver spots or solar lentigo) are collections of pigment caused by exposure to the sun. Pigment is deposited as a response to injury, just like a scar is a response to a cut. The pigment collects in areas injured because of thin skin or greater sun exposure. Age spots also can be caused by bruising that leaves blood pigment behind. They are most common in people older than 55. The spots commonly appear on the hands, but they can be almost anywhere, especially sun-exposed areas, such as the face, back, arms, feet and shoulders.\n\n",
      "Symptoms of age spots": "The only symptom is the appearance of darkened spots on the skin. They do not itch and are not painful.\n",
      "Diagnosing age spots": "You can diagnose age spots yourself by their appearance. If you are concerned about changes in your skin, contact your doctor. He or she can do tests to rule out other diseases.\n",
      "Expected duration of age spots": "Most age spots fade over time but probably will not disappear because the skin has been damaged.\n",
      "Preventing age spots": "By limiting your sun exposure, you can decrease the possibility of age spots. Sun exposure before the age of 20 is the major factor that determines how your skin will look in later life. If you already have age spots, limiting your exposure to the sun can help prevent them from enlarging or darkening.\nTo protect your skin from the sun, wear long-sleeved shirts, pants and a hat. Use sunscreen if you will be outside for more than a few minutes. Avoid being in the sun during midday (10 a.m. to 3 p.m.), when the sun's rays are the most intense.\n",
      "Treating age spots": "Age spots do not need to be treated. If you want cosmetic therapy, a dermatologist may be able to prescribe medication to lighten the spots or offer some other form of therapy.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you are concerned about changes in your skin, contact your doctor. He or she can rule out cancer or other underlying medical conditions.\n",

      "What is aging?": "We all know the obvious signs of aging: wrinkles, gray hair, a slightly stooped posture, perhaps some \"senior moments\" of forgetfulness. But why do those things happen? What is aging?\nEach of us is made up of cells — 13 trillion of them. Our tissues and organs are each a bunch of cells, held together with various natural materials that the cells have made.\nFrom the moment of conception, each of our cells — and, hence, our tissues and organs — begins a process of aging. Early in life, of course, we still are growing, and expanding the number of cells that we have. The cells are aging, but so slightly that we can't see it: we just see the body growing and developing.\nAt some point in life, often in the 30's, the tell-tale signs of aging begin to be apparent. They can be seen in everything from our vital signs (like blood pressure) to our skin, to our bone and joints, to our cardiovascular, digestive, and nervous systems, and beyond. Some aging changes begin early in life. For example, your metabolism starts to gradually decline beginning at about age 20. Changes in your hearing, on the other hand, do not usually begin until age 50 or later.\nWe do not yet fully understand the complex interplay of factors that cause us to age as we do. We know that many different things affect aging: genetics, diet, exercise, illness, and a host of other factors, all of which contribute to the aging process.\nA series of remarkable biological research studies since the 1990s have identified genes that can profoundly influence the rate at which cells, and animals, age. The good news from these studies is that biological changes that extend life also seem to extend vitality: animals that live longer remain quite healthy for most of their lengthened life.\nNone of these discoveries is close to providing a \"fountain of youth\" for humans, but some scientists believe that research breakthroughs regarding aging in the 21st century will lead to the development of drugs that can extend human life and simultaneously improve human health. If that happens, of course, it will only be a good thing if the world finds room, work and resources for all the additional people.\nFollowing are examples of how aging affects some of our major body systems.\nCells, organs, and tissues:\nHeart and blood vessels:\nVital signs:\nBones, muscles, joints:\nDigestive system:\nBrain and nervous system:\nEyes and ears:\nSkin, nails, and hair:\n",
      "Symptoms of aging": "We each age at different rates, and to different degrees, and yet we experience many common effects of aging. Some common signs and symptoms of aging include:\n",
      "Diagnosing aging": "Although the body and mind go through many natural changes as we age, not all changes are normal. There are many misconceptions about what is a normal part of aging. Senility, for example, is not a natural consequence of getting old, though many people believe that it is.\nIt is important to talk to your physician about any changes you are experiencing. Your doctor can help you differentiate between what is a normal part of aging, and what is not. If necessary, your doctor may refer you to a specialist.\n",
      "Expected duration of aging": "Aging is a continuous, progressive process that continues until the end of life.\n",
      "Preventing aging": "We cannot change our genes, and we cannot stop the passage of time. However, through lifestyle changes, we can reduce our risk for some of the diseases and conditions that become more likely as we age. We can also prevent diseases with screening tests and immunizations.\nScreening tests.Screening tests can detect diseases at early, and potentially curative, stages. However, the potential benefits of screening tests and procedures decline as you get older. Indeed, screening tests can sometimes lead to harm.  For example, if the test is falsely positive — if it indicates that a person may have a disease even when he doesn't — additional, more risky, and unnecessary, testing may be ordered.\nWork with your doctor to determine whether you should have a particular screening test. For example, a screening test for a particular disease may not be necessary if your risk of getting that disease is very low in the first place. Or if you know you would not accept treatment for a particular disease, if it was discovered by a screening test, then it might not be worth getting the test in the first place. Or if it would not extend or enhance your life to discover and treat a particular disease, then it would not be worth doing a screening test for the disease. Only your health care provider and you can determine whether screening tests are worthwhile.\nImmunizations.The most commonly recommended vaccines for adults include:\nThese are general recommendations for older adults. For some older adults, additional immunizations may be recommended. For others, such as people with weakened immune systems, some generally recommended immunizations should not be given. To sort this all out, talk with your doctor.\n",
      "Treating aging": "As you age, it is important to think about not only how long you will live, but how well you will live. The following strategies can help you maintain and perhaps even enhance your quality of life as you age.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you notice any changes that are not a normal part of aging. For example, although some occasional forgetfulness and slowing of thought are not uncommon, delirium, dementia, and severe memory loss are not a normal part of aging, and should be reported to your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although aging is inevitable, you can take steps to reduce your risk of disease and maintain your quality of life as you get older.\n",

      "What is alcohol use disorder?": "In an alcohol use disorder (AUD, commonly called alcoholism), excessive alcohol use causes symptoms affecting the body, thoughts and behavior. A hallmark of the disorder is that the person continues to drink despite the problems that alcohol causes. There is no absolute number of drinks per day or quantity of alcohol that defines an alcohol use disorder, but above a certain level, the risks of drinking increase significantly.\nHere are some defining characteristics of alcohol dependence:\nA person with alcohol use disorder has come to rely on alcohol physically, psychologically and/or emotionally. The brain adapts to the presence of alcohol and undergoes persistent changes. When alcohol use suddenly stops, the body is not accustomed to being alcohol free. The internal environment changes drastically, causing symptoms of withdrawal.\nExcessive alcohol use can be associated with many psychological, interpersonal, social, economic and medical problems. It can increase the risk of depression and suicide. It can play a role in violent crimes, including homicide and domestic violence (abuse of a spouse or child). It can lead to traffic accidents and even accidents involving intoxicated pedestrians who decide to walk home after drinking. AUD also can lead to unsafe sexual behavior, resulting in accidental pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.\nAlcohol use disorder increases the risk of liver disease (hepatitis and cirrhosis), heart disease, stomach ulcers, brain damage, stroke and other health problems. In pregnant women who drink alcohol, there is also the danger that the child will develop fetal alcohol syndrome, a cluster of health problems including unusually low birth weight, facial abnormalities, heart defects and learning difficulties.\nAlcohol problems come about from a combination of biological tendencies and environmental influences.\n",
      "Symptoms of alcohol use disorder": "Alcohol use disorder can involve any of the following symptoms or behaviors:\nBecause large amounts of alcohol can be toxic to the body (for example, the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal or nervous systems), problem drinking also may cause physical symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosing alcohol use disorder": "Even though alcohol related disorders are very common, relatively few individuals recognize the problem and get help. Therefore, screening is very important, whether primary care physicians or friends and family do it.\nOne commonly asked simple screening question helps identify the disorder:\nThe limits are different for women and men because of known differences in how alcohol is absorbed, distributed and eliminated from the body. Thus, the risk goes up for men who drink more than four standard drinks in a day (or more than 14 in a week); for women, there is a lower limit of three drinks in a day (and seven drinks in a week).\nAlmost always, people feel nervous or defensive about their drinking, which is one reason this very common problem so often goes undetected or unaddressed. Therefore, primary care physicians often make a point of use time during a visit to provide education about drinking and its dangers.\nAs a screening test, the single question about drinking patterns is as good as slightly more detailed ones, such as the CAGE questions. But these may be easier for concerned family members and friends to ask, since they may hesitate to ask direct questions about quantity.\nThe word \"CAGE\" is a device for remembering the questions (see the highlighted words):\nAnother screening questionnaire used by physicians is the 10-question AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) developed by the World Health Organization.\nAs much shame as symptoms may trigger, drinking problems are an understandable human predicament. The best strategy is to be frank in response to a doctor's questions.\nDuring an office visit, a health care professional will likely focus on the following.\nThe NIAAA has a very helpful set of resources for the general public and for clinicians. They are all easily available online atwww.niaaa.nih.gov.\n",
      "Expected duration of alcohol use disorder": "For most people who have an alcohol use disorder, the first alcohol-related life problems usually appear in the mid-20s to early 40s. Left untreated, AUD often persists and gets worse over time. Up to 30% of people with alcohol use disorder do manage to abstain from alcohol or control their drinking without formal treatment.\n",
      "Preventing alcohol use disorder": "There is no absolute way to prevent alcoholism. Screening is important, because early detection and treatment can prevent dangerous complications.\n",
      "Treating alcohol use disorder": "Treatment used to be limited to self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (established in 1935). Now there are a variety of evidence-based treatments, including psychotherapy and medication, to treat alcohol use disorders.\nThe first task is recognizing the problem. The well-known phenomenon of denial, which is a common part of the illness, often turns the illness into a chronic one. Unfortunately, the longer the illness persists, the harder it is to treat.\nA doctor or substance abuse expert may be able to help a person look at the consequences of drinking. A nonjudgmental approach to the discussion is essential. If an individual is beginning to think about alcohol as a problem worth trying to solve, educational groups may provide support for weighing the pros and cons of drinking.\nIt is never easy for family members and friends to talk about a drinking problem. A professional may have to help loved ones — kindly, but realistically — talk to the drinker about the painful impact that drinking has on them.\nOnce an individual commits to stop drinking, the physician will watch out for and treat withdrawal symptoms. Depending on the amount and duration of drinking and any symptoms, detoxification (often simply called \"detox\") from alcohol can be done as an outpatient, or as an inpatient in a hospital or drug treatment facility. During the withdrawal process, the doctor may prescribe a class of antianxiety drugs called benzodiazepines for a short period in order to reduce withdrawal symptoms.\nAfter weaning from alcohol, medication in some cases can help reduce cravings. Two medications that fit in this category are naltrexone and acamprosate. As an alternative, sometimes the drug disulfiram may be prescribed. Disulfiram does not reduce craving, but it creates an incentive not to drink, because drinking alcohol while taking it causes nausea and vomiting. An antiseizure drug called topiramate may diminish the reinforcing effects of alcohol. Alcohol treatment is an \"off-label\" use of topiramate, which means the FDA has not formally approved it for this use. Also not approved by the FDA, there is limited evidence that baclofen, a drug used to treat muscle spasticity, could help people quit alcohol use.\nAfter detoxification, many people with alcohol disorders need some form of long-term support or counseling to remain sober. Recovery programs focus on teaching a person with alcoholism about the disease, its risks, and ways to cope with life's usual stresses without turning to alcohol. Psychotherapy may help a person understand the influences that trigger drinking. Many patients benefit from self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Rational Recovery or SMART (Self Management and Recovery Training).\nOther mental health disorders can increase the risk of drinking. Depression and anxiety frequently occur along with an alcohol use disorder. It is very important to get treatment for such disorders if they are contributing to the problem.\nA doctor may order additional tests to find out whether alcohol-related damage to the liver, stomach or other organs has occurred. A healthy diet with vitamin supplements, especially B vitamins, is helpful.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you or someone you love has an alcohol-related problem. Remember, alcoholism is not a sign of weakness or poor character. It is an illness that can be treated. The sooner treatment begins, the easier alcoholism is to treat.\n",
      "Prognosis": "About 30% of people with alcohol use disorder are able to abstain from alcohol permanently without the help of formal treatment or a self-help program. For the rest, the course of the illness is very varied. Two of three people seeking treatment do reduce their intake and improve their overall health. Some people will go through periods where they remain sober, but then relapse. Others have a hard time sustaining any period of sobriety.\nIt is clear, however, that the more sober days you have, the greater the chance that you will remain sober. Another motivating fact: remaining sober can increase life expectancy by 15 or more years.\n",

      "What is alcohol withdrawal?": "Alcohol withdrawal is the changes the body goes through when a person suddenly stops drinking after prolonged and heavy alcohol use. Symptoms include trembling (shakes), insomnia, anxiety, and other physical and mental symptoms.\nAlcohol has a slowing effect (also called a sedating effect or depressant effect) on the brain. In a heavy, long-term drinker, the brain is almost continually exposed to the depressant effect of alcohol. Over time, the brain adjusts its own chemistry to compensate for the effect of the alcohol. If the alcohol is withdrawn suddenly, the brain is like an accelerating vehicle that has lost its brakes. Not surprisingly, most symptoms of withdrawal are symptoms that occur when the brain is overstimulated.\nThe most dangerous form of alcohol withdrawal occurs in about one out of every 20 people who have withdrawal symptoms. This condition is called delirium tremens (also called DTs).\nIn delirium tremens, the brain is not able to smoothly readjust its chemistry after alcohol is stopped. This creates a state of temporary confusion and leads to dangerous changes in the way your brain regulates your circulation and breathing. The body's vital signs such as heart rate or blood pressure can change dramatically or unpredictably, creating a risk of heart attack, stroke, or death.\n",
      "Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal": "If your brain has adjusted to your heavy drinking habits, it takes time for your brain to adjust back. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms occur in a predictable pattern after your last alcohol drink. Not all symptoms develop in all patients:\n",
      "Diagnosing alcohol withdrawal": "Alcohol withdrawal is easy to diagnose if you have typical symptoms that occur after you stop heavy, habitual drinking. If you have a past experience of withdrawal symptoms, you are likely to have them return if you start and stop heavy drinking again. There are no specific tests that can be used to diagnose alcohol withdrawal.\nIf you have withdrawal symptoms from drinking, then you have consumed enough alcohol to damage other organs. Your doctor will want to evaluate you for alcohol-related damage to your liver, heart, the nerves in your feet, blood cell counts, and gastrointestinal tract. Your doctor will assess your nutritional status and check for vitamin deficiencies.\nIt is usually difficult for people who drink to be completely honest about how much they've been drinking. You should report your drinking history straightforwardly to your doctor so you can be treated safely for withdrawal symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration of alcohol withdrawal": "Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal typically improve within five days, though a small number of patients may have prolonged symptoms lasting weeks.\n",
      "Preventing alcohol withdrawal": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is caused by many factors. If you have a sibling or parent with AUD, then you are three or four times more likely than average to develop the disorder. Some people with family histories of AUD choose to abstain from drinking, since this is a guaranteed way to avoid developing alcohol dependence. Many people without a family history also develop AUD. If you are concerned about your drinking, speak with your doctor.\n",
      "Treating alcohol withdrawal": "If you have severe vomiting, seizures, or delirium tremens, the safest place for you to be treated is in a hospital. For delirium tremens, treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) is often required. In an ICU, your heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing can be monitored closely in case emergency life-support (such as artificial breathing by a machine) is needed.\nMedicines called benzodiazepines can lessen alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Commonly used medicines in this group include chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and lorazepam (Ativan). Some doctors prefer phenobarbital over benzodiazepines to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms.\nMost alcohol abusers who are having withdrawal symptoms have a shortage of several vitamins and minerals and can benefit from nutritional supplements. In particular, alcohol abuse can create a shortage of folate, thiamine, magnesium, zinc, and phosphate. It also can cause low blood sugar.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Get help if you or someone you love has an alcohol-related problem. Alcohol use disorder is an illness that can be treated.\nIf you have an alcohol dependency problem and have decided to stop drinking, call your doctor for help. Your doctor can advise you and can prescribe medicines to make withdrawal symptoms more tolerable if they occur. Your doctor can also put you in touch with local resources that will help you to stay alcohol-free.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Alcohol withdrawal is common, but delirium tremens only occurs in 5% of people who have alcohol withdrawal. Delirium tremens is a dangerous, life-threatening problem.\nAfter withdrawal is complete, it is essential that you not begin drinking again. Alcohol treatment programs are important because they improve your chances of successfully staying off of alcohol. Only about 20% of people with alcohol use disorder are able to abstain from alcohol permanently without the help of formal treatment or self-help programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Of people who attend AA, 44% of those who remain free of alcohol for one year probably will remain abstinent for another year. This figure increases to 91% for those who have remained abstinent and have attended AA for five years or more.\nOn average, an alcoholic who doesn't stop drinking can expect to decrease his or her life expectancy by at least 15 years.\n",

      "What is an allergy?": "An allergy is an immune system reaction to something that is normally harmless. The reaction to the allergen (allergy-triggering substance) results in the release of histamine and other body chemicals. These chemicals cause the symptoms of allergies, which are usually mild but annoying. Examples include the runny nose of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or the itchy rash of poison ivy.\nHowever, in some cases, the symptoms can be much worse and involve the entire body. Anaphylaxis is the most severe allergic reaction. In anaphylaxis, these immune chemicals cause serious skin symptoms, such as hives and swelling, as well as severe breathing problems and very low blood pressure.\nAllergic reactions can be triggered by a wide variety of allergens. Common ones include:\n",
      "Symptoms of allergies": "Symptoms depend on the type of allergic reaction. Pollen and pet dander allergies typically cause\nNasal congestion can lead to mouth breathing, and the dripping of excess mucus from the nose into the throat can cause persistent cough and sore throat.\nThe most common symptom of a drug allergy is a skin rash. If you have been exposed to the drug before, the rash may start quickly, within the first day or two after taking the drug. The reaction can also be delayed and can occur as late as 8 to 10 days after starting the drug. It is even possible to develop the rash after you have finished a one-week course of medication. When this does occur, it is usually related to an antibiotic.\nSymptoms of anaphylaxis usually occur within seconds to minutes of exposure to the allergen, but symptoms can sometimes be delayed for several hours. Symptoms range from mild to very severe. They can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing an allergy": "The doctor will ask about your symptoms, including when and where you have them, and about your exposure to any of the common allergens that trigger reactions.\nMost often, your doctor will recognize an allergic reaction based on your symptoms, medical history, and the results of a physical examination. However, sometimes the symptoms and physical exam findings are less typical. In these cases, allergy skin testing and blood tests can help.\nTo identify the specific allergen, your doctor may refer you to an allergist, who can do skin testing. In skin testing, a small amount of a specific allergen is scratched, pricked, or injected into the skin. The allergist then monitors your skin for 10 to 20 minutes to see if a reaction develops.\nBlood tests can also be done to measure the number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that increases in number during allergy seasons) or the levels of IgE, an allergy-inducing antibody. An elevated eosinophil count or IgE level tells the doctor that there is an allergic response, while skin tests provide more specific information about what the person is allergic to.\n",
      "Expected duration of an allergy": "Allergy symptoms can persist year-round, occur only during certain seasons, or happen only when there is exposure to certain allergens. For many, allergy symptoms tend to diminish with age.\nWith early and appropriate treatment of an anaphylactic reaction, symptoms improve quickly within a few hours. If a person has already developed the more serious symptoms and any related dangerous conditions, it may take a few days to fully recover after treatment. If untreated, anaphylaxis can cause death within minutes to hours.\n",
      "Preventing allergies": "You can help prevent allergic reactions by reducing your exposure to the suspected allergens. For example, to help reduce exposure to outdoor allergens:\nYou can prevent anaphylaxis by avoiding the allergens that trigger your symptoms. For example, people with food allergies should always check the list of ingredients on food labels, and they should always ask the waiter or waitress to check with the chef about food ingredients before eating at a restaurant. If you are allergic to bee stings, you should limit gardening and lawn mowing, and you should not use perfumes hair sprays, or wear bright clothing that could attract insects.\nPeople with a history of anaphylaxis should wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace to alert others in the event of another reaction. In addition, ask your doctor if you should carry a pre-loaded syringe of epinephrine (adrenaline), a medicine used to treat anaphylaxis. At the first sign of symptoms, you or a helper (family member, co-worker, school nurse) can inject the pre-loaded epinephrine to help control your allergic reaction until you reach medical attention.\n",
      "Treating allergies": "Although the best way to treat allergies is to minimize exposure to the allergens, many of them, such as pollen, are impossible to avoid completely. There are many medicines, both prescription and non-prescription, to treat allergic symptoms from airborne allergens and pet dander. Non-prescription antihistamines and decongestant pills can be used to relieve nasal congestion and itchy eyes. Decongestant nasal sprays can give relief for a few days, but they can cause congestion to get worse if they are used for more than three days.\nOlder antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl, many generic versions) can make you drowsy. They can help if your allergy symptoms keep you up at night. During the day, people more commonly use long-acting non-sedating antihistamines, such as fexofenadine (Allegra) and loratadine (Claritin). You may need to work with your doctor to find the specific antihistamine that best relieves your symptoms with the fewest side effects.\nCorticosteroid nasal sprays are probably the most effective treatment for both seasonal and year-round allergic rhinitis. Examples include beclomethasone (QNSAL, Beconase), budesonide (Rhinocort), and fluticasone (Flonase). People with seasonal allergies should start the nasal corticosteroid spray a week or two before an expected rise in pollen counts.\nMontelukast (Singulair) can be used alone or in combination with other medications to treat allergic rhinitis. It is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, which decreases the allergic response in a different way than either antihistamines or corticosteroids. It is taken by mouth once a day.\nYour doctor may recommend allergy shots, also called immunotherapy. This treatment is aimed at desensitizing your body's immune reaction to your specific allergens. For this treatment, increasing concentrations of the allergen are injected under your skin either weekly or biweekly. This gradually increases your body's tolerance for the allergen. If immunotherapy is effective, allergy symptoms usually subside within six months to a year. Treatment is often continued for three to five years.\nSymptoms of anaphylaxis usually require an injection of epinephrine.  This is the most important treatment for anaphylaxis symptoms because it can help prevent any throat swelling from progressing to a blocked airway, which could otherwise result in suffocation. Low blood pressure may need treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids or with medication to raise blood pressure. Symptoms can also be improved with antihistamines, anti-heartburn medicines known as H2 blockers, and corticosteroids such as prednisone. It is important to see a doctor right away for allergy reactions that are severe, and for all reactions that are treated with epinephrine.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment with your doctor if you are not sure whether your symptoms are due to allergies, or if your symptoms are not controlled to your satisfaction with over-the-counter medications.\nCall for emergency assistance immediately whenever you or a person you are assisting has symptoms of anaphylaxis. If you have a history of severe allergic reactions and have not mentioned this to your doctor, schedule an appointment soon. He or she can review your history and help you take the necessary precautions to avoid future problems.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, common allergy symptoms can be managed successfully by minimizing exposure to the allergens and treating with one or more medications.\nWith prompt, appropriate treatment, most patients who have had a severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, recover completely. A person who has had anaphylaxis is at risk of future severe reactions if he or she is exposed again to the same allergen.\n",

      "What are allergy shots?": "Allergy shots are a treatment that can help to prevent or minimize allergic reactions. They are personalized to each patient — the shots are only useful when specific allergy triggers have been identified. Allergy shots are received on a schedule, over a period of several years.\n",
      "What allergy shots are used for": "Common allergic symptoms are sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, or asthma attacks. Allergy symptoms are caused by your body's reaction to a substance (allergen) that is inhaled, touched, or eaten. Allergens cause no symptoms in a nonallergic person, but in an allergic person who is sensitized to that antigen, an immune reaction against the allergen causes symptoms.\nIn allergic reactions, the body responds to the allergen in the same way it would respond to fight off infection by a parasite. The immune system recognizes the substance as foreign and activates an army of antibodies to eliminate the invader. The antibodies bind with the allergen and then trigger immune system cells to release chemicals such as histamine. This release of histamine is what causes most allergy symptoms.\n\nAllergy shots, also known as allergen immunotherapy, cause the body to stop generating symptoms after exposure to certain allergens. Tiny amounts of the offending substance are injected under the skin with each shot. The shots stimulate the immune system just a little each time. Gradually, over weeks and months, the amount of allergen is increased.\nThis constant, low-level exposure stimulates a different type of immune reaction against the allergen. This new pattern of immune reaction substitutes for and is less bothersome than a traditional allergic response.\nAllergy shots can be a good long-term solution when they work well. For people who respond to the treatment, allergy shots can make allergy symptoms less severe and can cause them to occur less often.\nMany people benefit from allergy shots for many years after going through a full course of shots. A typical course is at least three years. It can take about six months to a year for symptoms to start to subside. For some people, there may be no or little effect even after a year of treatment. In such cases, it is not worth continuing the treatment.\nAllergy shots may be recommended for people with severe allergy symptoms who do not improve with other approaches, such as avoiding triggers or taking allergy medications. These shots also can be useful for people who have significant side effects from their medications. This therapy is especially helpful for people who find their lives disrupted by allergies, or people for whom allergies might become life-threatening, such as people who develop asthma attacks or a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Allergy shots can be used to reduce the severity of reactions to insect stings.\nNot all allergies can be treated with allergy shots. For example, food allergies are not treated with allergy shots because of the risk of severe reactions, including anaphylaxis.\n",
      "Preparing for allergy shots": "Before allergy shots can be given, you will need tests to determine which allergens are causing your allergic reactions. These tests can include skin or patch testing or a blood test called a radioallergosorbent test (RAST). The tests are a useful guide, but they are not always accurate, so you can have a positive test with no allergy symptoms or a negative test and still have allergy symptoms.\n",
      "How allergy shots are done": "When you get an allergy shot, a small amount of allergen is injected under the skin, usually in the fleshy part of the upper arm. In the beginning, injections are typically given one to three times each week. After that, the doses of allergen are increased gradually with each injection.\nThe maximum dose, called a maintenance dose, is reached after four to six months. The maintenance dose is given once a week or once every two weeks. After several months, the injection schedule may be reduced to once every three or four weeks. A full course of allergy shots usually takes between three and five years.\n",
      "Following up after allergy shots": "After each injection, you will be asked to remain in the clinic or waiting room for 20 minutes or longer so that any reactions to the injection can be recognized and treated immediately. People receiving allergy shots will be asked to keep to a strict schedule of injections, because missed injections may reduce the benefits and delay the effectiveness of treatment.\n",
      "Risks of allergy shots": "Most people do not have any bad reactions to allergy shots. Sometimes you may develop swelling, redness, or itching at the site of the injection. These mild reactions typically are treated with antihistamines, and your doctor may decide to adjust the dose for the next injection.\nOn rare occasions, a more severe reaction will occur. In some sensitive people, the allergy shot can cause asthma symptoms including difficulty breathing, wheezing, or coughing. Or, an anaphylactic reaction will cause dizziness, nausea, a swelling of the throat that can prevent breathing, or tightness of the chest. These reactions usually can be treated in the office, but occasionally they may require treatment at a hospital.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your physician or allergist if you notice any redness or swelling at the site of the injection, or if you experience any coughing or wheezing after a recent injection. If you develop difficulty breathing or talking, tightness in the chest, or if your throat is closing, you or someone with you should call your local emergency number.\n",

      "What is alopecia areata?": "Alopecia areata is a skin disorder that causes hair loss, usually in patches, most often on the scalp. Usually, the bald patches appear suddenly and affect only a limited area. The hair grows back within 12 months or less. For some people, however, the problem can last longer and be more severe, causing total baldness (alopecia totalis) or total loss of body hair (alopecia universalis).\nThe cause of alopecia areata is probably an autoimmune reaction. This means the body's immune system incorrectly attacks the body's own cells. In the case of alopecia areata, the cells under attack are in the hair follicles (structures that grow hair), especially follicles within the scalp.\nGenetic (inherited) factors may play a role, too, particularly when the disorder strikes those under age 30. Almost 40% of people younger than age 30 with alopecia areata have at least one family member who has been diagnosed with the same disorder.\nThe risk of developing alopecia areata is unusually high in people who have asthma, hay fever, thyroid disease, vitiligo (a condition in which patches of skin lose their color), pernicious anemia and Down syndrome.\nAlthough experts once believed episodes of alopecia areata could be triggered by stress, newer research has failed to prove that stress is a factor.\nAbout 60% of people with alopecia areata experience the first episode of hair loss before age 20. It is usually followed by hair regrowth. However, it's common for the problem to come back. New bald patches can develop at the same time older ones are regrowing hair.\n",
      "Symptoms of alopecia areata": "In its most common form, alopecia areata causes small round or oval patches of baldness on the scalp. The area of bald skin looks smooth and normal. In most cases, there are no other scalp symptoms. Occasionally, there is mild itching, tingling, tenderness or a burning sensation in the affected area. Some people with alopecia areata also have abnormalities in the surface of their fingernails, such as tiny pits or dents, grooves, superficial splitting, or an abnormal area of redness.\n\nIn rarer, more severe forms of the disorder, hair loss can involve the entire scalp or the entire body, including the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, underarm hair and pubic hair (hair around the genitals).\n",
      "Diagnosing alopecia areata": "Your doctor will usually be able to diagnose alopecia areata based on examination of the areas of your hair loss and your symptoms. To look for further evidence, your doctor may pull gently on the hairs near the edge of the bald area to determine whether these hairs come out very easily and to inspect them for any structural abnormalities of the root or shaft. If there is still doubt as to diagnosis, a small skin biopsy of your scalp may confirm the diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed and examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration of alopecia areata": "In most small patches of alopecia areata, the hair regrows within 6 to 12 months. However, it's common for the problem to happen again.\n",
      "Preventing alopecia areata": "Alopecia areata cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treating alopecia areata": "Although there is no permanent cure for alopecia areata, there are ways that may short-circuit the body's autoimmune reaction in the scalp and encourage hair regrowth. For limited areas of alopecia, the most effective initial therapy is a series of corticosteroid injections into the bald patches to suppress the immune reaction.\nSome people with the condition will respond to topical preparations applied to the affected areas, including minoxidil (Rogaine) which may increase hair growth by accelerating the speed of the natural hair cycle and increasing the diameter of hairs that begin to grow.\nMany other therapies can be tried if corticosteroids or topical treatments have not provided the desired improvements. Examples include a short course of oral corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and immunotherapy (such as baricitinib or ritlecitinib).\nYour treatment depends on several factors, including your age (some treatments are only for adults), the amount of your hair loss, and your willingness accept the risk of treatment-related discomfort or side effects.\nIf you have mild hair loss, you may choose to simply modify your hairstyle or wear a hairpiece until the bald area fills in.\nIf you lost a large amount of hair on your scalp, you may choose to wear a wig or hairpiece until your treatment starts to work. If you have an obvious loss of eyebrow hair, you may choose to have injections of tiny dots of colored pigments into the eyebrow area (a procedure called dermatography). If you find it hard to cope with the change in your appearance, mention this to your doctor or seek advice from a mental health professional.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment to see your doctor if:\n",
      "Prognosis": "In more than 90% of cases, hair grows back and fills the bald spot within one year, even without treatment. However, recurrences are common, and most people have several episodes of the disorder during a lifetime. Despite treatment, about 7% of people experience prolonged large areas of hair loss with little hair regrowth.\n",

      "What is altitude sickness?": "At higher altitudes, the pressure of the air around you (barometric pressure) decreases so there is less oxygen in surrounding air. People can live comfortably at moderately high altitudes, but the body must make some adjustments, and this takes time. If you ascend to altitudes above 8,000 feet, you will be in danger of developing uncomfortable or dangerous symptoms from the change in altitude.\nSymptoms of altitude sickness that are not life threatening are called acute mountain sickness. Mountain climbers on any high mountain and skiers in high-altitude locations such as Colorado are at risk of developing acute mountain sickness. Symptoms from acute mountain sickness improve if you descend to lower altitude quickly. For very mild symptoms, a delay before further climbing may be enough to allow symptoms to go away.\nAcute mountain sickness is the least dangerous of several kinds of altitude illnesses that can occur. This sickness affects close to half of all people who begin near to sea level and climb to 14,000 feet of elevation without scheduling enough rest time.\nSymptoms that develop at high altitude should be taken very seriously, since some altitude problems can develop into fatal illnesses. One dangerous reaction to high altitude is a condition called high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), in which the brain accumulates extra fluid, swells and stops working properly. A related illness, high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), can occur with or without warning symptoms that signal altitude sickness. HAPE causes fluid to enter the lungs. A type of altitude sickness called high-altitude retinal hemorrhage (HARH) can cause eye damage. Coma and death are the most serious consequences of altitude sickness.\nAltitude sickness is more likely to occur in people who have a previous history of altitude sickness. It is more likely if you climb quickly, if you exercise vigorously during your first few days of altitude exposure, and if you have been living at low elevation prior to your climb. Obesity appears to increase the risk for altitude sickness. Genetics may also put some people at increased risk, particularly for high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).\n",
      "Symptoms of altitude sickness": "As your body makes normal adjustments to adapt to a high altitude, you may experience a few symptoms that are bothersome but are not cause for concern. They include rapid (but still comfortable) breathing, shortness of breath with strenuous exercise, occasional short pauses in breathing while you sleep, and frequent urination. The last two symptoms are caused by a low carbon dioxide level, which triggers adjustments in the brain and kidney.\nMore serious symptoms are caused by low levels of oxygen in the blood and adjustments that are made by your circulation system.\nAcute mountain sicknessusually causes symptoms at least 8 to 36 hours after ascent.\nSymptoms of acute mountain sickness can include:\nHigh-altitude cerebral edemais considered by many experts to be an extreme form of acute mountain sickness. It usually develops after symptoms of acute mountain sickness. Symptoms of this more severe altitude disease may not be noticed immediately because the illness can begin during the night. Because this low-oxygen injury affects the brain and thought process, a person with high-altitude cerebral edema may not understand that symptoms have become more severe until a traveling companion notices unusual behavior.\nSymptoms may include:\nHigh-altitude pulmonary edema, which is the lungs' response to an increase in altitude, may occur with or without other symptoms of altitude illness. A low oxygen concentration can trigger blood vessels in the lungs to constrict (tighten), causing a higher pressure in the lung arteries. This causes fluid to leak from the blood vessels into the lungs. Symptoms of high-altitude pulmonary edema commonly appear at night and can worsen during exertion.\nSymptoms of high-altitude pulmonary edema include:\nHigh-altitude retinal hemorrhage can occur with or without symptoms. It usually is not noticeable unless the area of the eye that provides the most detailed vision (the macula) is involved.\nBlurred vision is the main symptom of high-altitude retinal hemorrhage.\n",
      "Diagnosing altitude sickness": "You must be able to recognize the early symptoms of altitude sickness, and you should watch carefully for symptoms when you are at risk because altitude illnesses can be life threatening.\nIf headache is your only symptom, you should stop climbing and take a mild pain reliever. If you have a headache that does not go away or if you have other symptoms that suggest acute mountain sickness, this illness can be diagnosed without tests.\nHigh-altitude cerebral edema can make it difficult to walk a straight line, and can lead to changes in thinking, hallucinations or an unexplained change in personality. If a person has these symptoms at high altitude, you should assume that the person has high-altitude cerebral edema. A person with these symptoms should descend immediately and seek medical care. Once a person with high-altitude cerebral edema has been transported to a medical center, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be done to confirm the cause of the symptoms. An MRI can show brain swelling.\nRecognizing high-altitude pulmonary edema can be difficult in its early stages because fatigue may be the only sign. Symptoms that should be of concern include difficulty exercising, dry cough, rapid heart rate (more than 100 beats per minute), and shortness of breath while resting. Listening to the lungs with a stethoscope may reveal a crackling noise with each breath. If blood oxygen levels were measured, they would be lower than expected for your altitude. X-rays may show signs of fluid filling one or more areas within the lungs, giving an appearance that is similar to pneumonia.\nHigh-altitude retinal hemorrhage can be diagnosed by a doctor who examines the eye with a hand-held instrument called an ophthalmoscope.\n",
      "Expected duration of altitude sickness": "If you are climbing and do not move back down to an elevation where you last felt well, your symptoms can worsen and can be deadly. Symptoms from acute mountain sickness will go away after two or three days of rest at a lower altitude. Severe syndromes such as HAPE can take weeks to disappear, and will require medical attention and possible hospitalization.\n",
      "Preventing altitude sickness": "Gradual changes in altitude will help your body adapt to the low-oxygen environment and can reduce your chances of developing all forms of altitude sickness. People adapt at different rates, but there are four general guidelines for climbing above 10,000 feet that are practical for climbers to follow:\nIf you develop early signs of altitude sickness, you can keep from getting worse if you immediately stop ascending or if you descend.\nMild symptoms of altitude adjustment, such as headache, can be prevented or at least limited by taking ibuprofen.\nIf you have experienced high-altitude illness in the past and are planning to again go to high altitude, you should get a prescription for acetazolamide (Diamox, generic versions) to take with you. All the measures noted above are most important, but you may want to start taking the drug as you reach higher altitudes. Acetazolamide can cause frequent urination, tingling in the fingers and toes and a metallic taste in the mouth.\nIf you previously have developed HAPE, you may receive the oral drug nifedipine (Procardia), the inhaled drug salmeterol (Serevent), or both medicines for a future rise to altitude. These medications may stabilize the blood-flow pattern in your lungs.\n",
      "Treating altitude sickness": "The first rule of treatment for mild symptoms of acute mountain sickness is to stop ascending until your symptoms are completely gone. If you have more severe symptoms or any symptoms of high-altitude cerebral edema, high-altitude pulmonary edema, or blurred vision, you need to move to a lower altitude as soon as possible, even if it's the middle of the night. If you remain at your current altitude or continue going higher, the symptoms will get worse and the sickness can be fatal.\nBesides moving to a lower altitude, you can treat mild altitude sickness with rest and pain relievers. The drug acetazolamide can speed recovery. This drug balances your body chemistry and stimulates breathing.\nIf you have symptoms of altitude sickness, avoid alcohol, sleeping pills and narcotic pain medications. All of these can slow your breathing, which is extremely dangerous in low-oxygen conditions.\nIf a descent must be delayed — you can treat high-altitude cerebral edema with supplemental oxygen and the drugs acetazolamide and dexamethasone, which help decrease brain swelling. If one is available, this condition is also helped by time spent in a portable hyperbaric (pressure) chamber, which simulates descent to a lower altitude, during the time that supervision and transportation arrangements are being made for descent to lower altitude.\nTreatment for high-altitude pulmonary edema is similar, but may also include oral nifedipine, furosemide and/or an inhaled bronchodilator.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "People with altitude sickness may not realize they are ill or that their symptoms are worsening. If you are accompanying someone who has symptoms of altitude sickness, help that person move to a lower altitude and consult a doctor as soon as one is available.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for altitude sickness depends on how quickly the person can be moved to a lower altitude, and how serious their symptoms are. Symptoms of altitude sickness can disappear in just a few days at lower altitudes. In many cases, activities at high altitude can be resumed. However, the condition can be fatal if the symptoms are severe and the person remains at a high altitude.\n",

      "What is Alzheimer's disease?": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a loss of brain functions that worsens over time. It is a form of dementia.\nAlzheimer's disease damages the brain's intellectual functions. Short term memory often is affected early. Gradually other intellectual functions deteriorate. Judgment becomes impaired. Most people with advanced AD lose their ability to do normal daily activities.\nAlzheimer's usually begins after age 60. Occasionally, it affects younger people.\nScientists are uncertain about what causes the symptoms of AD. Alzheimer's patients develop excessive deposits of two proteins in their brains. Researchers believe that these proteins distort communication between brain cells.\nA chemical called acetylcholine may also be involved. It helps transmit messages between brain cells. Levels of acetylcholine begin to drop in patients with AD. This may add to the communication problems between brain cells.\nEventually, brain cells themselves are affected. They begin to shrivel and die.\nThe following factors may increase your risk of Alzheimer's disease:\n",
      "Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease": "Alzheimer's is a progressive disease.\nIn the earliest stages of AD:\nAs the diseases gets a little worse:\nOlder or more distant memories are gradually lost.\nOn the other hand, a person with early AD usually is able to feed, bathe, dress and groom without help.\nMany people with AD develop psychological problems. These may include personality changes, irritability, anxiety or depression.\nAs AD progresses to its middle and late stages, the affected individual may:\n",
      "Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease": "A person with Alzheimer's often doesn't recognize that there is a problem. Usually family members and close friends notice the forgetfulness and changes in behavior.\nRather than trying to convince a person that he or she has a problem, arrange for a doctor's appointment. At least one family member or close friend should accompany the patient.\nThere is no definitive test for Alzheimer's disease. The doctor will diagnose AD by taking a thorough medical history and performing a physical examination. This will include a neurological examination and a mental status exam.\nThe doctor will want to know about:\nMore of this information is likely to be provided by family members and friends.\nThe doctor will do a neurological examination to check the brain and nerves. He or she will do a brief mental status examination. This includes visual, writing and memory testing.\nThe doctor will check for other illnesses that can cause symptoms that resemble Alzheimer's disease. Testing may include blood tests, such as measurements of the levels of vitamin B12and thyroid hormone. Very low levels of vitamin B12and a very underactive thyroid can cause problems with thinking and memory. These problems can improve and even go away with treatment.\nIf the doctor's simple testing of thinking and memory indicate that there may be a problem, more detailed testing of brain function can be done. This is called neuropsychological testing.\nIn some cases, the doctor may order a brain imaging study. A brain study can rule out other reasons for the symptoms. Brain imaging studies cannot diagnose Alzheimer's with certainty. However, together with the doctor's examination, and the blood and neuropsychological testing, they can help the doctor make a diagnosis.\nThe doctor may refer you to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis. Specialists include neurologists, geriatricians and geriatric psychiatrists.\n",
      "Expected duration of Alzheimer's disease": "Alzheimer's disease is irreversible. Once the diagnosis is made, mental function usually declines until death.\n",
      "Preventing Alzheimer's disease": "Staying physically and mentally active may help lower your risk of developing the disease.\nIn addition, regular physical exercise and a diet that includes fish, olive oil, and plenty of vegetables may delay the onset of symptoms and slow disease progression.\n",
      "Treating Alzheimer's disease": "There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. The goal of treatment is to manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.\nA class of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors helps to restore communication between brain cells. These drugs may slow intellectual decline in some people with mild to moderate AD. They work by increasing the brain's levels of acetylcholine.\nMemantine works differently. It has been shown to stabilize memory in some people with moderate to severe AD.\nTwo new treatments using monoclonal antibodies directed against brain amyloid beta have been granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are aducanumab (Aduhelm) and lecanemab-irmb (Leqembi), which may slow and even potentially halt progression of the disease. Scientists continue to investigate the best candidates for one of these therapies. However, there are concerns about potential significant side effects.\nSeveral specialists may be involved in care of the person with Alzheimer's disease, such as neurologists, psychologists, psychiatrists or geriatric doctors. Nurses and social workers play a very important role in care.\nMedications may be given to relieve depression and calm agitated behavior.\nHere are some easy to implement aspects of care that help ease symptoms:\nThe affected person often is unaware of these problems. He or she may even deny that they exist.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you or a family member has any of the following problems:\n",
      "Prognosis": "No medication can definitively cure Alzheimer's disease. But family support and medications may help the person maintain the ability to perform daily activities and relieve behavior problems. These measures may help allow the affected person to remain in his or her home.\n",

      "What is amenorrhea?": "Amenorrhea is when a woman of childbearing age fails to menstruate. A woman normally menstruates every 23 to 35 days.\nThe part of the brain called the hypothalamus regulates the menstrual cycle. The hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland lies just below the hypothalamus at the base of the brain.\nThe pituitary gland releases two hormones that regulate the female reproductive cycle. They are luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).\nLH and FSH influence the production of estrogen and progesterone. These hormones control cyclic changes in the lining of the uterus. This includes menstruation.\nIn order for a woman to have regular menstrual cycles, her hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, and uterus must be functioning properly. Her cervix and vagina must also have a normal anatomy.\nThere are two types of amenorrhea:\nPrimary amenorrheaoccurs when a woman has not had her first menstrual period (menarche) by age 15 or 16. This condition is also called delayed menarche. It is most often due to late puberty.\nThis is fairly common in teenage girls who are very thin or very athletic. These young women are typically underweight. Their bodies have not experienced the normal puberty-related rise in body fat. This rise in body fat triggers the beginning of menstruation.\nIn other girls, the delay of menstruation may be caused by a genetic disorder. Or it may result from abnormal female reproductive organs.\nSecondary amenorrheaoccurs when a woman has experienced menstrual periods, but stops menstruating for three or more consecutive months.\nSecondary amenorrhea can be caused by:\nFemale athletes, especially young women, are more likely to have amenorrhea. Exercise itself does not cause amenorrhea. But it is more likely in women who exercise very intensely or who increase the intensity of their exercise rapidly.\nSecondary amenorrhea occurs quite often in women who engage in activities associated with lower body weight, such as ballet and gymnastics.\n",
      "Symptoms of amenorrhea": "Amenorrhea is a symptom in itself.\nAny associated symptoms depend on the problem that is causing the amenorrhea.\nFor example, hormone imbalances may cause amenorrhea together with:\n",
      "Diagnosing amenorrhea": "Your doctor will ask you about:\nYour doctor will review your medical history. He or she will do a general physical examination, followed by a thorough pelvic exam. Your doctor will check whether you are pregnant.\nIf your doctor suspects a specific cause, he or she will ask additional questions. For example, if your doctor suspects a hormonal abnormality, he or she may ask about:\nIf you are an athlete, your doctor will ask about your training program. This is particularly likely if you are underweight or have a low percentage of body fat.\nYour doctor may order blood and urine tests to detect possible hormone imbalances. Common blood tests performed include the pituitary hormones FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), prolactin, and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone. Pelvic ultrasound, a painless test that uses sound waves, can identify structural problems in your uterus and ovaries.\nAdditional testing may be necessary to pinpoint the cause of your missed periods. Diagnosing amenorrhea can be complicated. There are many potential causes.\n",
      "Expected duration of amenorrhea": "In many teenagers with primary amenorrhea, puberty is late. But there is no permanent problem.\nHow long secondary amenorrhea lasts depends on the cause.\nFor example:\n",
      "Preventing amenorrhea": "In many cases, teenage girls can help to prevent primary amenorrhea. They should follow a sensible exercise program and they should maintain a normal weight.\nPrimary amenorrhea caused by anatomic abnormalities cannot be prevented.\nYou can prevent some forms of secondary amenorrhea. Take the following steps:\n",
      "Treating amenorrhea": "Primary amenorrhea caused by late puberty usually does not need to be treated. The condition will go away on its own.\nFor primary amenorrhea caused by genetic abnormalities, treatment depends on the problem. For example, if the ovaries are not functioning properly, you may be given supplemental ovarian hormones. These will allow development of normal secondary sex characteristics such as breasts and pubic hair.\nIf amenorrhea is caused by a structural problem, surgery is usually necessary. For example, a vagina that doesn't have an opening may be surgically corrected.\nSecondary amenorrhea may be due to menopause or a hysterectomy. In this case, your doctor will prescribe medications. They will help prevent complications of low estrogen levels.\nFor other forms of secondary amenorrhea, the treatment depends on the cause.\n",

      "What is amyloidosis?": "Amyloidosis is a disease in which an abnormal protein called amyloid accumulates in body tissues and organs. The protein deposits can be in a single organ or dispersed throughout the body. The disease causes serious problems in the affected areas. As a result, people with amyloidosis in different body parts may experience different physical problems:\nIn many cases, the cause of amyloidosis is unknown, though it can develop due to chronic inflammation or a genetic mutation. To make matters more complex, amyloidosis is not a single disease; there are many different types of amyloid proteins that can be involved. For example, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a rare cause of dementia linked to viruses living in livestock) are two distinct conditions characterized by different types of amyloid deposits in the brain.\nOne of the methods physicians use to categorize the type of amyloidosis is to classify it as either primary or secondary. When there is no other underlying disease and health problems stem directly from amyloidosis, the disorder is considered primary. When another disease, usually a chronic inflammatory condition such as tuberculosis or rheumatoid arthritis), leads to amyloidosis, the disorder is considered secondary.\nThe current classification system divides amyloidosis into four categories, depending on the type of abnormal protein and the clinical situations in which the condition develops.\nThey include:\n",
      "Symptoms of amyloidosis": "The symptoms caused by amyloidosis depend on the extent of the damage done by the protein deposits, and which body organs are affected. Symptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing amyloidosis": "Amyloid proteins can build up for a long time before causing any symptoms, so the disease usually is not diagnosed until it is well established. Because the symptoms associated with amyloidosis are common to several different diseases, your doctor may run many different tests to check for other diseases first.\nHe or she will begin with a detailed review of symptoms and past medical history, including any family history of amyloidosis. A physical examination will look for signs of disease that might be caused by amyloidosis, such as:\nUrine will be collected to test for excess protein, which is often a first sign of systemic amyloidosis that has infiltrated the whole body. Blood will be drawn and tested to look for evidence of inflammation, abnormal blood counts, kidney or liver disease, or abnormal proteins.\nYour doctor may recommend a test checking for blood in the stool or an endoscopic procedure (in which a flexible, lighted tube with a tiny camera on the end is inserted into the rectum to the colon, or into the stomach through the mouth) to detect gastrointestinal bleeding. A chest x-ray echocardiogram or cardiac MRI may be ordered to look for heart enlargement or other signs of suggestive of amyloid-related heart disease.\nThe only definitive test for amyloidosis is a biopsy, in which a small sample of affected tissue is removed surgically and examined. The amyloid protein can be identified when the biopsy specimen is stained and viewed under a microscope. Increasingly, genetic testing and protein analyses are used to identify different types of amyloidosis.\nWhen the entire body is affected (a condition called systemic amyloidosis), biopsies of the rectum or from abdominal fat often reveal the diagnosis. If the amyloid has accumulated in a single organ, such as the brain, the biopsy needs to come directly from that organ. For this reason, many types of amyloidosis are difficult to diagnose. For example, in Alzheimer's disease, a biopsy of brain tissue rarely is performed. The biopsy could injure the brain and while the results might provide a diagnosis, it rarely changes treatment. When amyloidosis is diagnosed or highly suspected, additional blood and urine tests will be done to look for diseases that could cause the protein accumulation.\n",
      "Expected duration of amyloidosis": "Amyloidosis is usually a lifelong condition that cannot be reversed or cured. If amyloidosis is related to another disease, treatment will focus on treating that disease to stop further amyloid damage.\n",
      "Preventing amyloidosis": "Because the cause of most cases of primary amyloidosis is unknown, there is no way to prevent it.\nSecondary amyloidosis can be prevented only by preventing or promptly treating the inflammatory disease that can trigger amyloidosis. For example, if rheumatoid arthritis is kept under control with medications, the chance of developing amyloidosis is small.\n",
      "Treating amyloidosis": "For secondary amyloidosis, the goal is to treat the underlying disease. For example, treating tuberculosis should stop secondary amyloidosis from getting worse. Similarly, controlling the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis with medications has made amyloidosis due to rheumatoid arthritis a rarity. A change in the type of dialysis membrane can be effective for amyloidosis related to dialysis.\nThere is no cure for most cases of primary amyloidosis. Treatment is directed at alleviating symptoms and trying to slow the progression of the disorder. Some medications, such as corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive medications, chemotherapy agents and colchicine, may be effective for some cases of amyloidosis, but they are not highly effective if the disease is severe or highly advanced. Several drugs have been approved to treat certain types of amyloid (called transthyretin, or TTR), including tafamidis and patisiran. For patients with dementia or other cognitive impairment related to amyloid plaques in the brain (as in Alzheimer's disease), anti-amyloid medicines, including lecanemab and donanemab, have been approved to slow disease progression.\nChemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplant may be highly effective for patients with amyloidosis that accompanies a form of bone marrow cancer called multiple myeloma. A bone marrow transplant is a procedure in which a patient's own bone marrow, which is often the source of amyloid protein, is destroyed and replaced with a donor's marrow. Certain forms of amyloidosis may respond to liver, heart and/or kidney transplant. New treatments are being investigated.\nIf patients develop severe complications from amyloidosis, those conditions will need to be treated. For example, dialysis may be necessary if kidney failure develops, and cardiac medications may improve heart function and reduce retained fluid if cardiac disease becomes a problem.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a doctor if you have any of the symptoms of amyloidosis, especially extreme fatigue, breathing problems, or black or bloody stools.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the type of amyloidosis and how severe it is at the time of diagnosis. The progression of secondary amyloidosis caused by a chronic inflammatory condition, such as an infection or rheumatoid arthritis, can be controlled by treating the underlying condition. For many cases of amyloidosis, however, there is no effective therapy and the disease will get worse over months or years. The more areas of the body that are affected and the more impaired the body organs are, the lower the chances of a good outcome. Even so, increased recognition of amyloidosis and improved therapies over the last decade have led to improved survival.\n",

      "What is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) causes a slow degeneration of nerve cells (called motor neurons) that control muscle movements. As a result, people with ALS gradually lose the ability to control their muscles. Fortunately, their capacity to think and remember things usually is not affected. ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous U.S. baseball player who developed the disease.\nThere are several diseases besides ALS that gradually destroy motor neurons (called motor neuron diseases), although ALS is the most common motor neuron disease. The different diseases have different prognoses.\nThe cause of ALS remains unknown. ALS generally strikes patients between the ages of 50 and 70. It affects men slightly more often than women. Some cases appear to be inherited. Certain genes may increase the risk of developing the illness.\n",
      "Symptoms of ALS": "Symptoms of ALS include:\n",
      "Diagnosing ALS": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history, and do a physical exam to look for the following signs:\nYour doctor will also check to see whether the following have been affected:\nThere is no single test result that confirms an ALS diagnosis. Your doctor will diagnose ALS based on the examination, and by excluding other causes of your symptoms.\nElectromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction tests are recommended in the evaluation of possible ALS. These tests measure how electrical signals travel down your nerves to your muscles, and are usually abnormal in ALS.\nBecause other neurological conditions besides ALS can cause similar symptoms, other types of studies sometimes are done to try to diagnose these other neurological conditions:\nA neurologist is usually the physician who diagnoses ALS. A neurologist is an expert in diseases of the nervous system. If your doctor suspects ALS, he or she should refer you to a neurologist for evaluation.\n",
      "Expected duration of ALS": "People with ALS live an average of three to five years after the symptoms begin. Most die from an inability to breathe or from lung infections. Lung infections tend to occur when breathing is impaired for long periods of time. People with other motor neuron diseases that are sometimes confused with ALS can live longer than three to five years after symptoms begin.\n",
      "Preventing ALS": "There is no known way to prevent ALS.\n",
      "Treating ALS": "There is no known cure for ALS.\nA number of drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ALS, including:\nRiluzole may help prolong survival and slow disease progression in some people. Edaravone and sodium phenylbutyrate-taurusodiol may slow disease progression and improve function in some people with ALS. A number of new treatments are under investigation.\nOther medications may help to manage symptoms of ALS, although they may not be approved specifically for ALS. For example, pain medications and muscle relaxants may help with painful muscle spasticity. A combination medication containing dextromethorphan and quinidine (brand name: Nuedexta) is approved for symptoms such as sudden or involuntary laughing or crying that may be prominent in ALS and other neurologic conditions.\nMechanical devices are available to make self-care easier for people with ALS. Examples include dressing aids and special utensils for eating. A cane or walker may help patients who have difficulty walking.\nPatients should consider the option of using a mechanical respirator if they become unable to breathe on their own. Artificial ventilation can help some patients survive for years. But many patients choose not to be kept alive in a state of total paralysis.\nPatients with ALS should discuss this issue with their doctors early in the illness. That way, decisions about emergency resuscitation can be made according to the patient's wishes in the event of life-threatening breathing problems.\nEmotional support is crucial. Much of this support can be provided by the patient's friends and family. But a qualified counselor or psychotherapist also can be a valuable asset.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor as soon as possible if you develop unexplained muscle weakness or difficulty controlling your movements. This is especially important if speaking, breathing or swallowing is affected.\n",
      "Prognosis": "ALS eventually affects muscles governing breathing, swallowing, and other crucial body functions. As a result, ALS ultimately leads to death.\nActive research continues into the causes and treatment of ALS.\n",

      "What is anal cancer?": "Anal cancer is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the anus. The anus is the end of the large intestine, through which solid waste leaves the body. The treatments for anal cancer and rectal cancer can differ. Doctors need to know the exact location and the specific type of cell that has become cancerous in order to choose the right treatment.\nThe body stores digestive waste (feces) in the rectum, the lower part of the large intestine. The feces travel through the anal canal, a short tube that connects the rectum to the anal opening where they are passed as a bowel movement.\nSeveral types of cells line the anal canal. Anal glands, which lie underneath the lining, lubricate the anal canal to ease bowel movements.\nSeveral types of tumors can form in the anus. These include noncancerous tumors and cancerous tumors that can spread to other parts of the body. Some noncancerous growths can turn cancerous over time.\n",
      "Risk factors of anal cancer": "The strongest risk factor is infection with the human papillomavirus virus (HPV). HPV causes wart-like growths around the anus. The subtype HPV-16 has a particularly strong connection to anal cancer risk. However, most people with HPV do not develop anal cancer.\nIn general, other risk factors are similar to the risks of acquiring and/or not clearing an HPV infection:\nSome people who develop anal cancer have no known risk factors.\n",
      "Symptoms of anal cancer": "Talk to your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Other conditions that are not cancer (such as hemorrhoids) may cause similar symptoms.\n",
      "Diagnosing anal cancer": "Sometimes doctors discover anal cancer during a routine physical exam or minor procedure. Some kinds of anal cancer may not cause symptoms until they're at an advanced stage. Your doctor may recommend the following tests to help diagnose anal cancer:\nIf the tests show cancer, the next step is to see whether it has spread within the anus or to other parts of the body. This process is called staging. It is important for determining your treatment options.\nImaging tests may be done as part of the staging process. These may include:\nTumors of the anal canal are grouped into a set of stages. Stage 0 is the earliest stage, while stage IV is the most advanced. Sometimes anal cancer comes back after treatment. This is called recurrent anal cancer.\n",
      "Expected duration of anal cancer": "Without treatment, anal cancer will continue to grow.\n",
      "Preventing anal cancer": "To help reduce your risk of anal cancer:\n",
      "Treating anal cancer": "There are several treatments for anal cancer. Your doctor will recommend specific therapies based on:\nThe standard treatments are radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, often in combination.\nThe most effective therapies usually include both chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\nWhen you talk to your doctor about the treatment options, ask him or her about the expected benefits and risks. How will this treatment affect your prognosis? What will your quality of life be during and after treatment?\nFollow-up tests during treatment will show how well the therapy is working. You should continue to have regular follow-up tests after your treatment is over to show if your condition has changed.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you experience any of the symptoms of anal cancer, including:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Anal cancer is often curable with treatment. The person's outlook depends on the location and size of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\n",

      "What are anal disorders?": "The anus is that part of the intestinal tract that passes through the muscular canal of the pelvis and anal sphincters. It is the final orifice through which stool passes out of the body. In adults, the anus is 4 to 5 centimeters long. The lower half of the anal canal has sensitive nerve endings. There are blood vessels under the lining, and in its mid portion there are numerous tiny, anal glands.\n\nThis article describes four disorders that cause anal pain and irritation:\n\n",

      "Diagnosing anal disorders": "Once you have described your symptoms, your doctor will ask questions about your medical history and lifestyle that will help in evaluating your anal problem. Depending on your symptoms, the doctor may ask about:\nNext, your doctor will perform a physical examination of your abdomen, followed by an external examination of your anal area and a digital (finger) rectal examination. Usually your doctor will also perform anoscopy (insertion of a tube-like instrument into the anus to look inside the anal canal) and sigmoidoscopy (a short telescope to examine the rectum and lower colon).\n",
      "Expected duration of anal disorders": "How long anal disorders last varies:\n",
      "Preventing anal disorders": "You may be able to prevent anal fissures by preventing constipation. To do this, soften your stool by gradually adding more fiber to your diet, and by drinking 6 to 8 glasses of water daily. Commercially available fiber supplement powders work well.\nAlthough it is not always possible to prevent other types of anal disorders, you may be able to decrease your risk for these illnesses by:\n",
      "Treating anal disorders": "A doctor must diagnose the four anal disorders described here. Once the diagnosis is made, your treatment may or may not involve surgery, depending on the specific disorder. If surgery is necessary, your doctor will use whatever type of anesthesia is appropriate to help prevent you from feeling pain in this very sensitive area.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly whenever you have rectal bleeding or any bloody discharge from the anus. Even if you have been treated for a bleeding fissure in the past, it is always safer for your doctor to determine the best course of action. This is especially true if you are over age 40, when there is an increase in the risk of rectal bleeding from colorectal cancer and other serious digestive diseases.\nAlso, call your doctor if you have:\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, the prognosis is excellent. Almost all acute fissures heal quickly with conservative treatment, and almost all fistulas and chronic fissures can be corrected with surgery. Appropriate treatment of anal strictures will allow stool to pass easily and comfortably.\nMost anal abscesses heal after being drained by a doctor. Some develop into anal fistulas. If a fistula does complicate the healing of an abscess, a fistulotomy will totally eliminate both the fistula and any remaining abscess in most patients.\n",

      "What is it?": "Anal itch, also known as pruritus ani, is an irritating, itchy sensation around the anus (the opening through which stool passes out of the body). Anal itch is a symptom, not an illness, and it can have many different causes. In most cases, a person with anal itch does not have a disease of the anus or rectum. Instead, the itchy sensation is a sign that one or more of the following has irritated the skin in the area:\nLess often, anal itch is a symptom of some illness or condition that either affects the anal area alone, or involves larger areas of the digestive tract or skin. Some examples include:\nWorldwide, anal itch is a very common problem that occurs in up to 45% of people at some time during their lives. Men are affected two to four times more often than women. People who are overweight, perspire heavily, or routinely wear tight-fitting underwear or hosiery are more likely to get anal itch.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Anal itch is an irritating sensation around the anus that is relieved temporarily by scratching or rubbing. The problem is often worse at night and may interfere with sleep. In most cases, the skin in the area is red.\nIf anal itch becomes a chronic (long-term) problem, the skin around the anus may become raw and tender from repeated scratching, or it may thicken and become leathery. Repeated scratching also can cause breaks in the anal skin that can lead to painful local infections.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "To help identify the cause of your anal itch, the doctor may ask you to describe your current diet and medications, your bowel habits, and the way you routinely clean your anal area after a bowel movement. The doctor will review your medical history, including any history of rectal problems (hemorrhoids, fissures, or fistulas) or skin problems (psoriasis, eczema, or seborrhea). Your doctor's questions will be followed by a physical examination of your anal area and, sometimes, by a digital rectal examination. If you have a history of skin symptoms involving other parts of your body, your doctor will want to examine these skin areas as well.\nIf your anal itch is due to a local irritation in the anal area, the doctor usually can diagnose the problem based on your history, diet, and personal hygiene routine, and the results of your physical examination. Sometimes, the doctor will request a stool sample if he or she suspects a worm or parasite infection. Rarely, your doctor may need to examine the area by inserting a special viewing instrument called an anoscope into your anus. This can help your doctor determine whether the itch is being caused by a problem inside your rectum.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long an anal itch lasts depends on its cause. If the itch is due to a simple skin irritation, the problem usually goes away quickly once you identify the source of irritation and avoid it. In most cases, simple treatment measures provide some relief within one week and cure the problem totally within one month.\n",
      "Prevention": "In many cases, you can prevent anal itch by taking the following steps:\n",
      "Treatment": "In most cases, anal itch can be treated by:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If treating anal itch yourself doesn't relieve the itch after three to four weeks, call your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is excellent, since most people who have itching in the anal area don't have an illness involving the anus or rectum. Overall, about 90% of patients find relief by avoiding scratching and other simple therapies.\n",

      "What is anaphylaxis?": "Anaphylaxis is a severe, sometimes life-threatening, allergic reaction that occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure an allergy-causing substance (allergen). Anaphylaxis also is called anaphylactic shock.\nIn an allergic reaction, the body's immune system responds to the presence of an allergen by releasing histamine and other body chemicals. These chemicals cause the symptoms of allergies, which are usually mild but annoying, such as the runny nose of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or the itchy rash of poison ivy. However, in some cases, the symptoms can be much worse and involve the entire body. Anaphylaxis is the most severe allergic reaction. In anaphylaxis, these immune chemicals cause serious skin symptoms, such as hives and swelling, as well as severe breathing problems, such as swelling in the throat, narrowing of the lower airways and wheezing. The chemicals also cause blood vessels to widen dramatically, which leads to a rapid, severe drop in blood pressure (shock). Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening medical emergency.\nAlthough the specific allergen that triggers anaphylaxis may be different for each patient, it often can be traced to one of the following sources:\n",
      "Symptoms of anaphylaxis": "Symptoms of anaphylaxis usually occur within seconds to minutes of exposure to the allergen, but symptoms can be delayed for several hours. For some people, symptoms do not always show up after an exposure, but are triggered if an exposure is followed by vigorous exercise. Symptoms range from mild to very severe. These symptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing anaphylaxis": "The doctor will ask about the patient's allergy history and about his or her exposure to any of the common allergens that trigger anaphylaxis. It is very important for the doctor to know if the patient's symptoms started soon after exposure to an allergen, for instance after eating nuts, after a bee sting or after taking an antibiotic. Because the patient may be too sick to provide this information, a family member, friend, co-worker or school nurse will need to help. People with a history of severe allergic reactions should consider wearing a medical alert identification necklace or bracelet to save valuable time in identifying the problem.\nThe doctor usually can diagnose anaphylaxis based on the patient's history and the results of a physical examination.\n",
      "Expected duration of anaphylaxis": "With early and appropriate treatment, cases of anaphylaxis can improve quickly within a few hours. If a person has already developed the more serious symptoms and dangerous conditions, it may take a few days to fully recover after treatment. If untreated, anaphylaxis can cause death within minutes to hours.\n",
      "Preventing anaphylaxis": "You can prevent anaphylaxis by avoiding the allergens that trigger your symptoms. For example, people with food allergies should always check the list of ingredients on food labels, and they should always ask the waiter or waitress to check with the chef about food ingredients before eating at a restaurant. If you are allergic to bee stings, you should limit gardening and lawn mowing, and you should not wear perfumes, hair sprays or bright clothing that attracts insects.\nPeople with a history of anaphylaxis should wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace to alert others in the event of another reaction. In addition, ask your doctor if you should carry a pre-loaded syringe of epinephrine (adrenaline), a medicine used to treat anaphylaxis. At the first sign of symptoms, you or a helper (family member, co-worker, school nurse) would inject the pre-loaded epinephrine to treat your allergic reaction until you reach medical attention.\nAllergy shots, also called immunotherapy, are used to gradually change the type of reaction that a person has after an insect sting. Allergy shots cause the immune system to react by producing varieties of antibodies and cells that do not cause dangerous symptoms, instead of producing antibodies and chemicals that result in allergy symptoms. On rare occasions, allergy shots also can be used to prevent certain medication allergies. Allergy shots are not used to treat food allergies, because the shots themselves are too likely to cause anaphylaxis. However, oral (swallowed) immunotherapy using extraordinarily diluted samples of peanut is a newer treatment for peanut allergy.\n",
      "Treating anaphylaxis": "Symptoms of anaphylaxis usually require treatment with epinephrine, by injection. People who have had anaphylaxis can carry a pre-loaded syringe containing epinephrine. This is the most important treatment for anaphylaxis symptoms, because it can help to prevent a blocked airway from throat swelling, which can otherwise result in suffocation. Symptoms can also be improved with antihistamines and anti-acid medicines known as \"H2 blockers.\" It is important for a doctor to see you right away for allergy reactions that are severe, and for all reactions that are treated with epinephrine. Low blood pressure may need treatment with intravenous fluids or with medication to support blood pressure.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call for emergency assistance immediately whenever you have or a person you are assisting has symptoms of anaphylaxis. If you have a history of severe allergic reaction and have not mentioned this to your doctor, schedule an appointment soon. He or she can review your history and help you take the necessary precautions to avoid future problems.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With prompt, appropriate treatment, most patients who have had a severe allergic reaction can recover completely. Unfortunately, even with treatment, some people die from anaphylaxis.\nA person who has had anaphylaxis is at risk of future severe reactions if he or she is exposed again to the same allergen.\n",

      "What is angina?": "Angina is discomfort or pain in the chest that happens when not enough oxygen-rich blood reaches the muscle cells of the heart. The most common cause of angina is coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is usually caused by atherosclerosis. In this condition, fatty deposits (called plaque) build up along the inside walls of blood vessels that feed oxygen and nutrients to the pumping heart.\nAngina typically occurs when one or more of the coronary arteries become narrowed or blocked. The discomfort of angina can be mild at first and gradually get worse. Or it may come on suddenly.\n\nAlthough angina most commonly affects males who are middle-aged or older, it can occur in both sexes and in all age groups. Angina also is called angina pectoris.\n",
      "Symptoms of angina": "Angina usually feels like a pressing, burning or squeezing pain in the chest. The main pain usually is under the breastbone. The pain may spread up toward the throat and into the jaw. The discomfort may be felt in the left arm and sometimes in both arms. People with angina often break out into a cold sweat. Other symptoms can include shortness of breath, lightheadedness and nausea.\n\nDoctors divide angina into two types:\n\n",
      "Diagnosing angina": "Your doctor may suspect that you have angina based on your symptoms and your risk of coronary artery disease. The doctor will review your medical history to see if you smoke (or have smoked) and whether you have diabetes and high blood pressure. Your doctor will ask about your family's medical history and will review your cholesterol levels, including LDL (bad) and HDL (good) cholesterol.\nThe doctor will check your blood pressure and pulse and listen to your heart and lungs. You may need one or more diagnostic tests to determine if you have coronary artery disease. Possible tests include:\n",
      "Expected duration of angina": "An angina attack usually lasts less than five minutes. Pain that lasts longer than that or is severe may signal a more significant decrease in the heart's blood supply. This can happen when someone is having a heart attack or unstable angina.\n",
      "Preventing angina": "You can help to prevent angina caused by coronary artery disease by controlling your risk factors for clogged arteries:\nIt's also wise to exercise regularly and to maintain an ideal weight. If angina attacks are triggered by emotional stress, learning stress management or relaxation techniques may be helpful.\n",
      "Treating angina": "When angina is caused by coronary artery disease, treatment usually includes:\nWhen lifestyle changes and drugs do not provide enough symptom relief, you and your doctor will consider additional testing, such as a cardiac catheterization. Depending on the site(s) and amount of coronary artery blockage, you may get much better symptom relief with balloon angioplasty and a stent, or possibly coronary artery bypass surgery.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you experience chest pains, even if you think you are too young to have angina and have no history of heart problems in your family. Your doctor will recommend the next steps based on how you describe your symptoms and risk factors.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In people with coronary artery disease, the outlook depends upon many factors, including the location and severity of the artery narrowing, and the number of coronary arteries involved. Proper treatment greatly improves the outlook for people with coronary artery disease.\n",

      "What is an ankle fracture?": "When a bone breaks or cracks, the injury is called a fracture. In the ankle, three different bones can be fractured:\nAlthough there are many ways to fracture an ankle bone, the most common injuries involve a sharp twist of the ankle, or a direct impact that fractures at least one of the bony knobs in the ankle.\nAnkle fractures are common injuries among people of all ages, interests, and lifestyles. People involved in a wide range of athletic activities, including ballet dancers, snowboarders, basketball players, and skydivers, are at high risk of ankle fractures because of the physical demands placed on their ankles.\nAnkle fractures also occur during slips on icy pavement, falls from a high place, or direct impacts to the ankle during a car crash or motorcycle accident. High-impact ankle injuries are especially dangerous if the bone pokes through the skin and is exposed to the air. The open wound allows bacteria to contaminate the broken bone, and greatly increases the risk of infection.\n",
      "Symptoms of an ankle fracture": "If you have a fractured ankle, your symptoms probably will include:\n",
      "Diagnosing an ankle fracture": "After reviewing your symptoms, the doctor will want to know:\nIn addition, your doctor will review your medical history, especially any previous injuries to your ankle, foot, or lower leg. If you have symptoms of an open fracture, the doctor also will want to know the approximate date of your last tetanus shot.\nThe doctor will examine your ankle, foot, and lower leg. During this examination, the doctor will check for swelling, deformity, abrasions, bruising, and soreness along the lower part of your tibia and fibula, especially at the medial malleolus and lateral malleolus (bony knobs). The doctor also will gently press and feel parts of your injured ankle to determine whether there are any points of extreme tenderness that can help to identify the site of a fracture. He or she also will compare range of motion of the injured ankle with the normal joint movement in your uninjured ankle. After a significant injury, your pulse, foot movements, and skin sensation will be checked to see if there are signs of artery or nerve damage.\nIf the results of your physical examination suggest that that you have a fractured ankle, your doctor will order x-rays to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration of an ankle fracture": "If your fracture can be treated without surgery, you probably will wear a cast for about six to eight weeks. Once your cast is removed, you may need physical therapy before you can resume your normal activities. Total recovery time varies depending on the severity of your injury and the physical demands of your lifestyle.\nIf you need surgery to repair your fractured ankle, your recovery will take longer than an ankle fracture that could be treated without surgery.\n",
      "Preventing an ankle fracture": "An athlete who has recovered from an ankle injury may find it helpful to use high-top shoes, an ankle brace, or ankle taping to reduce the risk of further joint damage.\n",
      "Treating an ankle fracture": "If your ankle fracture involves only one malleolus, and the segments of broken bone lie very close together, your doctor usually can treat the injury by immobilizing your ankle and foot in a cast for six to eight weeks. After the cast is removed, your doctor may prescribe physical therapy to help restore the normal range of motion in your ankle joint.\nIf you have more extensive damage to your ankle, or the fragments of broken bone are separated far from one another, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair your fractured ankle with special screws or wires. Injuries resulting in broken skin require antibiotics given intravenously (into a vein) to prevent infection.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor or go to an emergency room immediately if:\nAlso, check with your doctor if you have less severe symptoms that do not improve within three to four days.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If an ankle fracture is treated promptly and properly, the prognosis is good. Overall, about 80% of all sports-related ankle fractures heal without any long-term complications. However, as with any significant injury near a joint, arthritis may develop years later.\n",

      "What is an ankle sprain?": "An ankle sprain is a stretch or tear in one or more of the ankle ligaments. Ankle ligaments are slightly elastic bands of tissue that keep the ankle bones in place. Ankles are particularly prone to sprain because of the small size of the joint and the forces exerted when walking, running and jumping, especially if the surface is uneven.\nDepending on the severity of the injury, an ankle sprain is classified as:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most sprains happen when the ankle twists suddenly. The most common injuries happen when the foot rolls onto the outside of the ankle, straining the outside ligaments of the ankle joint. These are called inversion injuries. Less common are eversion injuries, which happen when the ankle rolls onto the inside of the joint, stretching the ligaments on the inner side of the ankle.\nSymptoms of a sprained ankle include:\n",
      "Diagnosing an ankle sprain": "A health care professional may suspect that you have a sprained ankle based on the history of your injury and your current symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis, he or she will examine your ankle for:\nFor severe ankle injuries, a health care professional may request x-rays to determine whether a bone is broken. Fractures can occur with or without a sprain and can cause similar symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration of an ankle sprain": "How long it takes to heal depends on the severity of the sprain. Grade I sprains usually take one to two weeks to heal completely. Grade II sprains can take up to six weeks. Grade III sprains can take six months or longer to heal completely. On average, count on a two- to four-week healing period for any significant sprain.\n",
      "Preventing an ankle sprain": "To reduce your risk of spraining an ankle:\nIf you have had several ankle sprains, you'll need a good rehabilitation program that involves strengthening and balance exercises.\n",
      "Treating an ankle sprain": "The first treatment for an ankle sprain is usuallyRICE(rest, ice, compression and elevation):\nIn most cases, follow-up rehabilitative exercises are vital to restore strength and range of motion in the sprained ankle. These exercises should also help to prevent future ankle injuries. You may need crutches until you can walk without pain. For severe sprains, you may need a brace for protection and stability. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help to control pain and swelling.\nAn orthopedist should evaluate people with Grade II or Grade III sprains. Grade III sprains with complete tears of the ligaments may require surgery to repair the injured ligaments.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Get immediate medical attention if you are unable to put weight on the injured ankle or if the injured ankle appears to be obviously deformed. Also see your doctor if the pain and swelling continue or worsen.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The degree of recovery depends on the severity of the sprain and the age and health of the patient. Most people recover completely from sprains, especially Grade I and Grade II sprains. However, once a significant sprain occurs, the joint may never be as strong or stable as it was before the injury. With appropriate rehabilitative exercises, some of this lost strength and stability may return.\n",

      "What is ankylosing spondylitis?": "Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of arthritis that causes inflammation and damage in the sacroiliac joints between the spine and the pelvis. It also can affect other areas of the spine and other joints, such as the knee. Eventually, inflamed spinal joints can become fused, or joined together so they can't move independently. The word spondylitis refers to inflammation of the spine; ankylosis means fusion or the melding of two bones into one.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is relatively rare. It affects about 1 in 1,000 people. It may run in families, although its cause is not understood. It most commonly strikes otherwise healthy young men. Men get this condition 10 times more often than women. The disorder most often appears between the ages of 20 and 40, but can develop in children.\n",
      "Symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis": "A person with ankylosing spondylitis commonly will feel pain or stiffness in the lower back. The symptoms are typically worse in the morning or after periods of inactivity and improve with activity or exercise. People who have this disorder may feel worse if they do not exercise regularly. (Back pain from many other causes tends to worsen with exercise.)\nUsually, back pain begins in the sacroiliac joint and works its way up the lower spine. Eventually, the disorder can affect the entire spine. People can have pain and tenderness in the thighs, hips and other joints of the torso. Other joints, such as knees and ankles, can be inflamed as well, although it usually affects no more than three or four joints in the arms and legs.\nAs the spine and its supporting structures stiffen, a person may begin to stoop over. With time, bones of the spine can fuse or grow together, causing an extremely stiff, rigid backbone called a poker spine. This may make it difficult to take a deep breath because the rigid spine and stiff joints between the ribs and breastbone make it difficult for the chest to expand. The pain and rigidity in the lower back can cause problems walking. Almost any movement can become painful.\nIn some cases, inflammation can also affect the lungs, causing shortness of breath, and inflammation in the eyes may cause reduced vision with red, painful eyes.\nOther possible symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis include:\n",
      "Diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis": "Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. He or she will examine you and may recommend X-rays or other imaging tests, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, to look for problems in your sacroiliac joints or any other joints that are painful or stiff.\nYour doctor also may order a blood test to look for a gene called HLA-B27. This gene is found more commonly in people with ankylosing spondylitis than in other people. However, having the HLA-B27 gene does not mean you have or will develop ankylosing spondylitis; and some people with ankylosing spondylitis do not have this gene.\nYour doctor will diagnose the condition based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination, blood tests and imaging tests.\n",
      "Expected duration of ankylosing spondylitis": "In many cases, ankylosing spondylitis is mild and may go undiagnosed for years. However, it is a lifelong problem.\n",
      "Preventing ankylosing spondylitis": "There is no way to prevent ankylosing spondylitis.\n",
      "Treating ankylosing spondylitis": "The aim of treatment is to reduce joint pain and to prevent, delay or correct any damage or deformities of the spine and other joints.\n",
      "Medications": "A number of medications may be effective, including anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), pain relievers (such as acetaminophen), sulfasalazine or methotrexate. Intermittent, short-term corticosteroids can be quite effective, whether injected into a joint or taken in pill form. Newer oral medication options include tofacitinib (Xeljanz) and upddacitinib (Rinvoq).\nA number of injectable medications may also be quite effective, including:\n",
      "Daily management": "Treatment usually includes physical therapy and exercise. A physical therapist will develop an exercise routine for you that probably will include range-of-motion and stretching exercises to help the spine remain flexible. Abdominal and back exercises can help you maintain good posture so you may be less likely to stoop.\nSwimming is an especially good exercise because it may be easier to move stiff, painful areas in the water. Biking also tends to be a good exercise for people with ankylosing spondylitis. Avoid any activities that could put too much stress on your back. For example, jogging may cause back pain to become worse because jogging puts more pressure on spinal joints.\nHot baths, heat and massage can help to relieve pain. If you can, sleep on your back on a firm mattress and use a small pillow or none at all.\nBecause ankylosing spondylitis can affect the bones of the rib cage, your lung capacity can become restricted. Breathing exercises can help maintain your lung capacity. If you smoke, quitting should be a priority.\nEven with the best treatment, some people will develop a fused spine, but most people can still function. At some point, a back brace or other devices, such a corset, cane or joint splints, may help. If other organs are involved, such as your heart or eye, you may have to see a specialist, and may need additional treatment and monitoring. For example, a person with ankylosing spondylitis may need a pacemaker if his or her heart is affected.\n",
      "Surgery": "As with other forms of arthritis, surgery may be considered as a last resort when other therapies do not work well enough.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a health care professional if you have any symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, especially:\n",
      "Prognosis": "People with ankylosing spondylitis usually go through alternating periods where symptoms improve and worsen. These periods can't always be predicted. With treatment, symptoms usually can be relieved or controlled so that you can lead a normal, productive life. However, even with treatment, you may develop permanent posture and movement problems.\n",

      "What is anorexia nervosa?": "Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that affects about one in 100 to 200 girls or women in the United States. A person with this disorder limits eating, and by definition weighs at least 15% less than his or her ideal weight.\nAt least 90% of cases are in women and the disorder usually begins in adolescence. The weight loss may delay the onset of menstruation, or stop it once it has started, Anorexia nervosa rarely occurs before puberty or after age 40. And, although uncommon, it can occur in men.\nA person with this disorder fears being overweight. She may be completely convinced that she weighs too much despite what the scale shows or what other people say. To achieve or maintain leanness, she may exercise obsessively or use laxatives.\nBecause a super-restrictive diet requires exquisite control, she may become extremely careful, inhibited, and controlled in other areas of life as well. For example, she may retreat from social contacts or may perform ritual behaviors.\nThe term anorexia literally means having a lack of appetite. But this is misleading, because people with the disorder usually have a strong appetite or actively suppress a craving for food.\nThey diet to the point of starvation. And they may even experience pride stemming from the strength implied by such self-denial. The disorder is defined not by whether a person feels hunger but by how much weight he or she has lost.\nAlthough anorexia nervosa appears in many cultures, it is most often diagnosed in industrialized societies, where thinness is often equated with attractiveness.\nMany people have anorexia nervosa symptoms without having the full disorder. These symptoms can cause significant distress, particularly in adolescence, where girls and boys may strive for an idealized and unrealistic body image.\nThe cause of anorexia nervosa is not clear. It is likely a combination of inherited (genetic) vulnerability and environmental factors. Based on decades of research, experts see the disorder as having many elements:\nIn advanced stages of the illness, the restrictive dieting is hard to reverse. At that point, hunger may disappear completely and the pursuit of thinness becomes a way of life.\nStarvation causes medical complications of its own, such as thyroid problems, anemia, and joint pains. Extreme dieting can lead to death in the most severe cases, most commonly because of an irregular heartbeat caused by an imbalance of the salts in the bloodstream.\nThere are two subtypes of anorexia nervosa, a restricting type and a binge-eating/purging type. A person with the restricting type of anorexia diets, fasts, and exercises. People with the binge-eating/purging type eat large quantities of food, then vomit. Many people go back and forth between these two patterns.\n",
      "Symptoms of anorexia nervosa": "Symptoms of anorexia nervosa include:\n",
      "Diagnosing anorexia nervosa": "A mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologis,t or social worker, can diagnose anorexia nervosa based on the history reported by the patient and the family. The person with anorexia may not report symptoms reliably, so reports from family members may be necessary to make a diagnosis. Often, a pediatrician or primary care physician is the first to make the diagnosis.\nOne special problem with this diagnosis is that individuals with the disorder often deny the problem and are reluctant to participate in an evaluation.\nThe health care professional will ask about the person's attitudes toward weight, food, and body image, and he or she will check for lower than normal body weight and the physical signs of the illness, which include:\nSome clinicians find it helpful to use screening tests. Examples are the Eating Disorders Inventory and the Eating Aptitudes Test.\nAs part of the evaluation, the clinician may explore whether the person has other problems that need treatment, such as a mood or anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, a personality disorder, or substance abuse. It is common for people with anorexia nervosa to have symptoms of depression, including low mood, social withdrawal, irritability, poor sleep, and diminished interest in sex. People with the binging/purging type of anorexia nervosa are more likely to have mood ups and downs, have problems with impulse control, and abuse alcohol and drugs.\nMedical evaluation includes blood work to investigate whether poor nutrition has caused anemia (low red blood cell count), altered liver and kidney function, and abnormal levels of blood chemicals such as low potassium.\nThe doctor may find:\nA doctor also needs to make sure there are no other medical problems that might be causing weight loss such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, or hormonal problems. People with those illnesses, however, do not usually have a problem with their body image.\n",
      "Expected duration of anorexia nervosa": "Duration varies. Some people with anorexia nervosa have a single, relatively brief episode after experiencing an isolated stressful event. For others, the problem becomes chronic (long-lasting) and the person's condition gradually deteriorates.\nMany people start by restricting food, then later binge and purge. Recent research has shown that the majority of cases go away by late adolescence. But a significant number of people do have continuing problems with diet and body image into adulthood, even though the severity of the symptoms is likely to be less.\n",
      "Preventing anorexia nervosa": "There is no known way to prevent anorexia nervosa. It's helpful to detect the problem as early as possible because early treatment can shorten the course of the illness.\n",
      "Treating anorexia nervosa": "Clinicians aim first to evaluate whether or not a person with anorexia nervosa is in medical danger as a result of food restriction. A general goal is to help the person achieve a minimum healthy weight. But there is not one most recommended way to accomplish this goal.\nA priority is to correct any problems with body fluids and salts. Doctors evaluate the person's heart, liver, and kidney functioning and provide necessary medical support. Hospitalization may be necessary in the most severe cases (for example, when weight loss is more than 20% to 25% of body weight), but most treatment is done in an outpatient setting.\nTreatment often requires coordinating help from a number of professionals, especially in the most serious cases. Comprehensive eating disorder programs are efficient because they bring all the treatment elements together.\nOne major task is helping the person with anorexia nervosa recognize the illness and participate in treatment. Education is key, with an emphasis on addressing the distorted beliefs about body image that are central to the disorder. But it should be noted that patients with anorexia nervosa are in many ways already experts in their illness. Therefore, the people providing treatment have to try not to behave in a way that could be perceived as patronizing or scolding.\nAnorexia nervosa is best treated with a combination of psychotherapy, support, education, medication, and medical and nutritional supervision.\nAlthough a number of specialized psychotherapy approaches have been studied, there is some evidence that supportive psychotherapy and sympathetic clinical management are just as helpful, if not more so. Elements include education, care, and support. Praise, reassurance, and advice can help sustain a positive therapeutic relationship that encourages adherence to treatment.\nBehavior treatments that solely provide rewards and punishments to change eating behavior are probably not effective if they don't also deal with the patient's distorted thinking. They may help in the short run, but patients can easily learn how to comply with the program to gain discharge (that is, \"eat their way out of the hospital\"). Then, since they have not given up their distorted body image and beliefs about food, they soon resume abnormal eating.\nHealth care professionals try to define the problem in a way the person can accept, then work with the person toward common goals.\nNo single psychotherapy approach has proven to be better than any other. Therefore, once the person acknowledges the problem, a variety of therapy techniques may be tried.\nA nutritionist can plan a healthy eating program that promotes slow weight gain.\nCognitive therapy encourages the person to recognize flawed thoughts about body image, food, and dieting, and helps to control anxiety about eating.\nFamily therapy may be important, both to support and educate family members and to examine negative interactions in the family. For example, family members can be taught to avoid unproductive power struggles about food. In families where there is a great deal of open conflict, educational programs designed for parents may be more useful than therapy meetings that include the patient.\nLater, when symptoms are under better control, the person with anorexia nervosa may want to understand the meaning of the symptoms, including how they may have affected important relationships, limited emotional growth, and altered self-concept. It may also be possible to look at what problems may have set off the eating disorder in the first place.\nPatients that show no progress in weight gain with nutritional counseling and psychotherapy may benefit from medication. In small clinical trials, the antipsychotic olanzapine appears to have the best chance to promote weight gain. This is especially true for patients that have distorted thinking about food and body image.\nAmong other medications, none has been proven best for anorexia nervosa. Low weight also can make a person more susceptible to drug side effects.\nAntidepressant medications can improve associated mood problems. But they usually do not hasten weight gain (unless depression is in partcausingthe weight loss). Nonetheless, antidepressants and other medications may provide relief for people who have symptoms of depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a mental health professional, a pediatrician, or a primary care physician if you have a question about food restriction, feelings of sadness or anxiety, or persistent problems with body image. A family member may be the first to notice such problems, and should contact a health care professional on behalf of the person having trouble.\nSevere weight loss or starvation can become a medical emergency, so early treatment is desirable.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many people have mild forms of anorexia nervosa and are open to treatment. These people will respond well, particularly when a variety of approaches are combined.\nFor people who have lost a great deal of weight and have medical complications, aggressive care can reverse a downward course. There is a significant risk of death for people who have been hospitalized for medical complications of anorexia nervosa, especially when they are very resistant to treatment. However, the majority of people with anorexia nervosa either improve significantly or have a full recovery.\nPeople who have recovered from anorexia nervosa may need long-term support and treatment to prevent relapse.\n",

      "What is antibiotic-associated diarrhea?": "In healthy people, many different species of bacteria live inside the bowel. Many are harmless or even helpful to the body, but a few have the potential to be aggressive troublemakers. Under normal circumstances, the \"bad\" bacteria are far outnumbered. So, the bowel's natural ecological balance keeps them under control.\nThis can change dramatically when a person begins treatment with an antibiotic. This is because antibiotics can kill large numbers of the bowel's normal bacteria, altering the delicate balance among the various species.\nIn most cases, the result is only a mild case of short-term diarrhea that goes away quickly after the antibiotic treatment ends. Occasionally, however, an antibiotic eliminates so many of the bowel's \"good\" and harmless bacteria that the aggressive \"bad\" ones are free to multiply out of control.\nOne type of bacteria in particular, a species calledClostridium difficile(C. difficile), can overgrow inside the bowel, producing irritating chemicals that damage the bowel wall and trigger bowel inflammation, called colitis. This can cause abdominal pain, cramps, diarrhea, and fever. In some cases, high-volume, diarrhea is so frequent that the person develops dehydration (very low levels of body water).\nA more severe complication ofC. difficileovergrowth can lead to a type of bowel inflammation called pseudomembranous colitis. Patients with pseudomembranous colitis are at risk of a severely distended colon that stops functioning (toxic megacolon), which can lead to a hole through the bowel wall (bowel perforation).\nBecauseC. difficilelives silently in the bowels of about 5% of people, episodes ofC. difficilediarrhea occasionally occur in otherwise healthy adults and children who are taking antibiotics.\nC. difficileinfections are more common among recently hospitalized patients, the elderly and those with debilitating illnesses. In hospitals and nursing homes,C. difficilebacteria can be spread from patient to patient on the unwashed hands of health care workers, and also via toilets, sinks and other surfaces that have been contaminated by stool.\nAccording to some studies, more than 20% of patients in hospitals and nursing homes silently harborC. difficilein their intestines. In any one of these patients, treatment with an antibiotic is all it takes forC. difficileto overgrow and cause illness. Many different types of antibiotics have been blamed for causingC. difficilediarrhea and colitis. Common culprits include clindamycin (Cleocin), ampicillin (sold under several brand names) and cephalosporins, such as cephalexin (Keflex).\n",
      "Symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea": "If you are taking an antibiotic, the medication will cause a mild change in your population of intestinal bacteria that may cause occasional loose stools or mild diarrhea for a few days. These symptoms should stop once your antibiotic treatment ends.\nIf you have a more dramatic change in your bowel bacteria, andC. difficilebacteria begin to overgrow, your symptoms can include:\nIn some cases, fever and abdominal pain develop several days before diarrhea starts.\nDiarrhea caused by theC. difficiletoxin usually starts while you are taking an antibiotic, but the diarrhea may be delayed and start a few weeks after you have stopped taking the medication.\n",
      "Diagnosing antibiotic-associated diarrhea": "If you have unexplained diarrhea, and you are taking antibiotics, be sure to tell your doctor the name of your prescription antibiotic, the date when you first began treatment and the date when your bowel symptoms began.\nTo evaluate the severity of your diarrhea and assess your risk of dehydration, your doctor will ask about:\nIn most cases, your doctor can diagnose antibiotic-associated diarrhea based on your symptoms, your history of antibiotic treatment and the results of your physical examination. Your doctor is likely to suspectC. difficileinfection if you have unusually severe symptoms, if you have been discharged recently from a hospital or nursing home, or if you have:\nThis testing usually involves checking one or more stool samples for the presence of a toxin made byC. difficilebacteria.\n",
      "Expected duration of antibiotic-associated diarrhea": "If you have mild, uncomplicated antibiotic-associated diarrhea, your bowel movements should gradually return to normal once your antibiotic treatment ends.\nC. difficilediarrhea usually begins to subside within the first 72 hours of treatment with medication. However, some people develop severe symptoms with a longer recovery time.C. difficilediarrhea can recur despite adequate initial therapy.\n",
      "Preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea": "If you are caring for someone who has diarrhea, you may be able to avoid spreading potentially harmful bacteria by taking these steps:\n",
      "Treating antibiotic-associated diarrhea": "For cases of mild antibiotic-associated diarrhea, try the following suggestions:\nIf you have more severe diarrhea due to aC. difficileinfection, your doctor probably will stop your antibiotic treatment and prescribe an oral antimicrobial drug called vancomycin or fidaxomicin.\nIf treatment fails to eradicate aC. difficileinfection, your doctor may advise a fecal transplant.\nAbout 3% of people withC. difficileinfection will become seriously ill, with high fevers, severe abdominal pain, and a complication called toxic megacolon (enlarged colon) that will show up on a computed tomography (CT) scan. These patients should be evaluated by a surgeon. If the surgeon is concerned that the intestine might develop a hole or leak (perforate), he or she will recommend emergency surgery to remove the affected portion of the colon.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly if you have been taking antibiotics and you develop any of the following symptoms:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Overall, the prognosis is excellent. Almost all adults with mild antibiotic-associated diarrhea recover completely without complications.\nAmong people with more severeC. difficilediarrhea, 15% to 35% have the problem return within eight weeks. Most of these patients can be successfully treated with a second course of medication.\n",

      "What is antiphospholipid antibody syndrome?": "Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a condition defined by the presence of abnormal antibodies and a tendency to form blood clots or to have miscarriages.\nPeople with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome produce antibodies that interact with certain proteins in the blood. This causes the blood to clot more than normal. The most commonly measured antiphospholipid antibodies include lupus anticoagulant and antibodies to cardiolipin or beta-2 glycoprotein.\nThe blood clots often form in the leg veins. The clots also can form in arteries. The blood clots may occur in any organ, but they tend to favor the lungs, brain, kidneys, heart and skin.\nThere are two types of APS: primary and secondary. People with primary APS do not have any associated condition. The secondary form is associated with another immune disorder, such as lupus, an infection or, rarely, the use of a medication (such as chlorpromazine or procainamide).\nA person may have a blood test that detects antiphospholipid antibodies. This does not necessarily mean that he or she has APS or will develop symptoms or problems of APS.\n",
      "Symptoms of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome": "The symptoms of APS can include any of the following:\nNervous system.APS can cause:\nHeart and blood vessels.APS can lead to:\n\nBlood cells.Some people with a condition called immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) have antiphospholipid antibodies. The primary problem in ITP is low platelets, the blood cells that aid clot formation and prevent excessive bleeding. Over time, some people with ITP develop APS. People with ITP and APS can have problems with excessive clotting and excessive bleeding.\nAlso, red blood cells can break down abnormally. This may cause fatigue, dizziness, and pale skin. This is more common in people with lupus and secondary APS.\nLung.Blood clots in the lung can cause\nGastrointestinal.APS can affect the blood supply to the intestines, causing\nAPS can cause a condition called Budd-Chiari syndrome. In this syndrome, a blood clot prevents blood from flowing out of the liver. The person may experience\nKidneys.Blood clots that affect the kidneys can cause kidney damage and blood in the urine.\nSkin.APS can cause\nEyes.Veins or arteries in the retina can be affected. This can cause blurring or loss of vision.\nPregnancy.APS can cause problems for the pregnant woman such as stroke or blood clots in the lungs.\nAPS may be associated with a syndrome of pregnancy known as HELLP. HELLP stands forhemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells),elevatedliver tests andlowplatelets.\nIn addition, APS may be complicated by\n",
      "Diagnosing antiphospholipid antibody syndrome": "Many symptoms that occur with APS are common even without the condition. They do not necessarily mean APS is the cause.\nHowever, a doctor may order tests to detect the antibodies associated with APS (including lupus anticoagulant and antibodies to cardiolipin or beta-2 glycoprotein) when\nPeople with antiphospholipid antibodies may have a positive screening test for syphilis even though they do not have the disease. Fortunately, confirmatory tests are available to rule out syphilis infection in a person with antiphospholipid antibodies.\n",
      "Expected duration of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome": "Some people with APS continue to have symptoms off and on throughout their lives. Others improve without any repeat episodes.\nSome people even lose the antibodies associated with the syndrome. This can happen with primary APS. But it is especially common\n",
      "Preventing antiphospholipid antibody syndrome": "There is no known way to reliably prevent APS, although vaccination for viral infections (including influenza) could reduce the risk of APS triggered by viral infection. However, lifestyle changes can reduce the likelihood of blood clots.\nTo reduce your risk of blood clots:\n",
      "Treating antiphospholipid antibody syndrome": "If you have antiphospholipid antibodies but have not had blood clots or a miscarriage, your doctor may recommend that you take a low-dose aspirin every day. However, aspirin therapy may not be effective at preventing clots, and it may increase your risks of bleeding or stomach problems.\nFor people with a history of blood clots as part of APS, doctors usually prescribe a powerful blood thinner called warfarin (Coumadin). This medication usually is taken for life. People who take warfarin need to have their blood tested regularly. That's because if the blood is too thin, the risk of bleeding increases. If it is not thin enough, clotting is more likely. Other blood thinners (including dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban) appear to be less effective than warfarin. Aspirin may be added to warfarin, especially if the clot was in an artery.\nAnother commonly used blood thinner is called heparin. It may be used before you start taking warfarin. Heparin also is used for pregnant women, because warfarin is not safe for the developing fetus. Heparin is only available as an injection.\nA woman with APS who is trying to become pregnant after repeated miscarriages may increase the chance of a successful pregnancy by getting heparin injections and taking low-dose aspirin. This treatment should start as soon as the pregnancy is discovered. It continues until just before delivery.\nOther medications may be recommended for advanced cases of APS include:\nHowever, the benefits of these medications as primary treatment have not been proven but may be added to other treatments (such as warfarin) if the condition has been difficult to treat.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a doctor if you have any symptoms of APS such as unexplained leg swelling or shortness of breath. Call your doctor if you have APS and want to become pregnant.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People with primary APS generally lead normal, healthy lives with the help of medication and lifestyle changes.\nPeople with secondary APS generally have a similar prognosis. But their illnesses and life spans can be affected by associated conditions. APS associated with infections or medication use may be temporary and resolve once the infection subsides or a medication is stopped.\nSome people with APS will have repeated blood clots despite the best treatments. This is referred to as catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, a condition that, as the name suggests, can be fatal.\n",

      "What is antisocial personality disorder?": "Antisocial personality disorder, like other personality disorders, is a longstanding pattern of behavior and experience that impairs functioning and causes distress.\nBy definition, people with antisocial personality disorder don't follow society's norms, are deceitful and intimidating in relationships, and are inconsiderate of the rights of others. People with this type of personality may take part in criminal activity. But if they do, they are not sorry for their hurtful deeds. They can be impulsive, reckless and sometimes violent. This disorder is far more common and more apparent in men than women.\nPeople with antisocial personality disorder generally do not value \"playing by the rules.\" They do so only if they are threatened with punishment.\nThis attitude leads to a tendency to exploit others. They take advantage of the fairness or softheartedness of others, and they feel indifferent toward or even contemptuous of their victims.\nA person with this disorder has little, if any, ability to be intimate with another person. Any lasting relationships are likely to involve some degree of abuse or neglect.\nYet people with this disorder are sometimes charming and can be good actors who use lies and distortion to keep relationships going. Some with antisocial personality disorder have no goal beyond the pleasure of deceiving or harming others.\nPeople with antisocial personality disorder appear to care for no one but themselves. They may be able to understand the emotions of others. But they don't suffer any shame or guilt about the pain they may be causing. Instead, they use their knowledge of others' weaknesses to gain favors or to manipulate an outcome.\nA person with this disorder usually does not take responsibility for any of his or her own suffering. He or she will blame others when things go badly. Many with this disorder do suffer, because they can be self-defeating, and never get to enjoy the many pleasures that come to people who are better able to have mutual and satisfying relationships.\nPeople with this personality disorder can also have problems such as chronic boredom or irritability, psychosomatic symptoms, pathological gambling, alcohol and substance abuse, and a variety of mood or anxiety disorders. They have a higher risk of suicide. A significant number have had behavior problems or attention deficit disorder as children.\nAntisocial personality disorder is probably caused by a combination of factors. Having any of these characteristics does not necessarily mean that a person has antisocial personality disorder.\n",
      "Symptoms of antisocial personality disorder": "People with antisocial personality disorder tend to have few symptoms. Rather, they cause discomfort or distress to others through socially unacceptable behavior and by being:\n",
      "Diagnosing antisocial personality disorder": "The diagnosis is made on the basis of a person's history, usually by a mental health professional. There are no laboratory tests to assist in diagnosing this disorder. Other psychiatric disorders, such as a mood or anxiety disorder, attention deficit disorder, or substance abuse, may also be present.\n",
      "Expected duration of antisocial personality disorder": "All personality disorders are lifelong patterns.\n",
      "Preventing antisocial personality disorder": "There is no way to prevent this disorder.\nIt is conceivable that a general improvement in social conditions could reduce the incidence of antisocial personality disorder. An improvement in a person's social environment may reduce the severity of the problem, especially if changes are made early in life.\nResearch has yet to demonstrate an effective or practical way to accomplish these goals.\n",
      "Treating antisocial personality disorder": "Many psychotherapy techniques have been proposed for treating antisocial personality disorder. Unfortunately, research does not indicate that any of the current treatments is particularly helpful for treating the personality disorder itself.\nAs a result, the choice of treatment is usually guided by a person's specific circumstances.\nIn some cases, symptoms can be treated with medication, although again there is no specific medication that is considered best for all people with this disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft), may decrease aggressiveness and irritability. These drugs are useful if either anxiety or depression are present, or if the person is using substances to self-medicate for anxiety or low mood.\nThere are many questions about how helpfulanyof these interventions can be in an illness where, by definition, people who are affected do not recognize that they have a problem. Treatment is more likely to be successful if it is started earlier in life. But it is difficult to change long-entrenched patterns of thinking and behavior.\nAlso, the longer a person lives with this personality style, the less he or she may be interested in taking responsibility for change. For some people, the tendency toward aggression and irritability decreases with age. But some personality characteristics may persist.\nOften the only thing that can protect victims of antisocial behavior is the criminal justice system. In rare instances, corrections systems (jails and prisons) provide opportunities for treatment or rehabilitation, but often these environments, with their abundance of antisocial individuals, tend to promote antisocial behavior.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "People with antisocial personality disorder generally do not acknowledge that they have a problem that requires treatment. When a pattern of antisocial behavior is noted, others can recommend or encourage treatment. However, treatment may only occur when a court imposes it.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The long-term outlook for antisocial personality disorder is highly variable. Although treatment can sometimes be successful, change is not likely to be rapid when antisocial behavior is severe. In such cases, resources of time and energy may be better spent in getting help for potential victims, especially those, such as spouses or family members, who live in close proximity to the person with the disorder.\n",

      "What is aplastic anemia?": "Aplastic anemia is a rare, potentially fatal disease in which the bone marrow doesn't make enough blood cells. The bone marrow is the central portion of the bones that is responsible for making:\nThe bone marrow releases the cells and platelets into the blood stream.\nA complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test that measures the number of red cells, white cells, and platelets circulating in the blood stream. People with aplastic anemia have low levels of all three types of blood cells that are normally manufactured in the bone marrow.\nAplastic anemia is a problem with cells in the bone marrow called stem cells. Stem cells are the basic \"mother cells\" that develop into the three types of blood cells. In aplastic anemia, something either destroys the stem cells or drastically changes the environment of the bone marrow so that the stem cells can't develop properly. Several factors can cause this problem, including:\nSome people are more likely to develop aplastic anemia because of their genetic (inherited) makeup. Fanconi's anemia is an inherited condition that causes aplastic anemia and also physical abnormalities. Some women develop a mild form of aplastic anemia during pregnancy, but it tends to disappear after delivery. In 50% to 65% of patients with aplastic anemia, the cause of the illness is not clear.\n",
      "Symptoms of aplastic anemia": "Symptoms and signs of aplastic anemia include:\n",
      "Diagnosing aplastic anemia": "Your doctor will review your medical history and ask you to describe your symptoms. Other questions may include:\nOn occasion, the presence of aplastic anemia can predate the development of some forms of leukemia.\nYour doctor will examine you to look for the signs of aplastic anemia. This will be followed by blood tests to measure levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Aplastic anemia is suspected when the tests show that levels of all three blood cell types are extremely low, but the cells themselves look normal. A test called a bone marrow biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nDuring a bone marrow biopsy, a small sample of bone marrow is taken by inserting a needle into the large pelvic bone just below the waist on either side of the spine. This bone marrow sample is examined in a laboratory. A hematologist (doctor who specializes in blood disorders) usually will confirm the diagnosis based on the results of bone marrow findings and basic blood tests.\n",
      "Expected duration of aplastic anemia": "How long aplastic anemia lasts depends on its cause, the severity of the disease, the age of the patient, and the response to therapy. For example, aplastic anemia often is a short-term condition when it develops as a result of certain types of drug exposure, pregnancy, infectious mononucleosis, or low-dose radiation. However, it often is a long-term problem when the cause is unknown, or when it develops as a result of hepatitis, certain toxins (benzene, solvents, insecticides), certain medications, high-dose radiation, or autoimmune disease.\n",
      "Preventing aplastic anemia": "You can prevent some forms of aplastic anemia by avoiding exposure to toxins, radiation, and medications that can cause the disease. To avoid being infected with hepatitis B virus (which can cause aplastic anemia), you can get the hepatitis B vaccine. HIV and hepatitis B can be prevented by practicing safe sex and not using intravenous drugs.\nSome forms of aplastic anemia cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treating aplastic anemia": "How you are treated for aplastic anemia depends on its cause and severity. If it is a short-term condition related to medication, pregnancy, low-dose radiation, or infectious mononucleosis, then you probably will recover without treatment. However, the symptoms can be treated. For example, bleeding episodes can be treated with transfusions of platelets and red blood cells, while infections can be treated with antibiotics. Women with mild forms of aplastic anemia also may be given oral contraceptives so that their monthly menstrual flow is not excessive.\nAt home, you should wash your hands often, shave with electric razors instead of blades to avoid unnecessary bleeding from nicks, and avoid participating in contact sports. Also, your doctor may prescribe a stool softener to make sure you don't have hard bowel movements, which can make you bleed from your rectum.\nThe two main treatments for aplastic anemia that is severe and long-lasting are bone marrow transplantation and immunosuppressive therapies.\nMost treatments for aplastic anemia require medications that severely impair the normal function of the immune system. This puts patients at risk for infections, often unusual ones. These infections may occur before the bone marrow has had a chance to recover and before the treatments have had their effect. It thus becomes very important to be under the care of specialists in blood disorders and if necessary, specialists in infectious disease.\nA bone marrow transplant is the most effective therapy, but the possibility of dying from the treatment increases with age, so it is most ideal for children, adolescents, and young adults. In addition, the treatment is safest when the patient has a sibling (brother or sister) with a similar bone marrow type who can be used as a donor. Only about 30 percent of people who need the procedure have siblings who can be donors. In some cases, a donor who is a match but is not related to the patient will be used. However, the rate of complications is higher when the donor is not a sibling.\nSome patients will be treated with immunosuppressive medications instead of bone marrow transplantation. These medicines include anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), prednisone, cyclosporine, and eltrombopag (thrombopoietin receptor agonist).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly if you notice abnormal bruises on your skin, or if you develop frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums, heavy menstrual flow, or rectal bleeding.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for aplastic anemia depends on its cause and severity, as well as the health and age of the patient. Cases that are caused by certain medications, pregnancy, low-dose radiation, or infectious mononucleosis often are short-term, and any complications (anemia, bleeding, increased infections) usually can be treated. Women who develop aplastic anemia during pregnancy may have the problem during future pregnancies as well.\nAplastic anemia can be fatal when it is severe and long-lasting. Patients who receive a bone marrow transplant from a sibling have the best prognosis. The survival rates are lower for patients treated with a bone marrow transplant from an unrelated donor. When a bone marrow transplant is not possible, about 50% of patients will respond well to immunosuppressive therapy alone.\nThe prognosis is poor for patients with severe, chronic aplastic anemia that does not respond to available treatments.\nPeople with aplastic anemia are at higher than average risk for developing leukemia.\n",

      "What is appendicitis?": "Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small, fingerlike tube that hangs from the lower right side of the large intestine. The purpose of the appendix is not known. It usually becomes inflamed because of an infection or an obstruction in the digestive tract. If untreated, an infected appendix can burst and spread the infection throughout the abdominal cavity and into the bloodstream.\n",
      "Symptoms of appendicitis": "Symptoms of appendicitis include:\nIf you have symptoms of appendicitis, do not take enemas or laxatives to relieve constipation: These medicines increase the chance that the appendix will burst. Also, avoid taking pain-relief medicines before seeing your doctor, because these medications can mask appendicitis symptoms and make diagnosis difficult.\n",
      "Diagnosing appendicitis": "Your doctor will review your medical history, especially any digestive illnesses. Your doctor will ask about your current digestive symptoms, including details about your most recent bowel movements: the timing, frequency, character (watery or hard), and whether the stool was streaked with blood or mucus.\nYour doctor will examine you and check for pain in your lower right abdomen. In children, the doctor will look to see whether the child holds his or her hands over the navel when asked where it hurts. In an infant, flexed hips (knees held toward the chest) and a tender abdomen can be important clues to the diagnosis.\nAfter the physical examination, your doctor will order blood tests to check for signs of infection and a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract problem. Your doctor may order an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan to help confirm the diagnosis. In very young children, a chest X-ray may be needed to rule out pneumonia.\n",
      "Expected duration of appendicitis": "Most people will seek medical attention within 12 to 48 hours because of the abdominal pain. In some cases, a low level of inflammation exists for several weeks before a diagnosis is made.\n",
      "Preventing appendicitis": "There is no way to prevent appendicitis.\n",
      "Treating appendicitis": "The standard treatment is to remove the appendix. The surgery, called an appendectomy, should be done as soon as possible to reduce the risk of the appendix rupturing. If appendicitis is strongly suspected, a surgeon will often advise removing the appendix even if an ultrasound or CT scan cannot confirm the diagnosis. The surgeon's recommendation to operate reflects the danger of a ruptured appendix: It can be life threatening, while an appendectomy is a relatively low-risk operation.\nSurgeons will frequently opt for laparoscopic surgery to remove the appendix because the average length of stay in the hospital is shorter and recovery is quicker compared to the standard surgical approach.\nPeople usually are given antibiotics intravenously (into a vein) during surgery. The antibiotic is continued until the day after surgery. If the appendix ruptured, the person will need to take antibiotics for a longer period of time.\nPeople with early appendicitis may be treated with what is known as an \"antibiotic first\" strategy. This means treating with antibiotics, often intravenously for 24 to 48 hours and then orally for another 5 – 9 days.\nPatients treated with this strategy need close observation. If they are not rapidly improving, surgery is performed. Even if the symptoms resolve completely, your doctor may recommend having an appendectomy later on.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "To avoid the risk of a ruptured appendix, contact your doctor immediately if you or a family member has symptoms of appendicitis. Appendicitis is an emergency, and it requires immediate attention.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People who need surgery often stay in the hospital two to three days (if the appendix did not rupture). People who have an appendectomy normally recover completely.\nIn cases of a ruptured appendix, the hospital stay is usually longer. Although it is rare, a person can die of appendicitis if a ruptured appendix spreads infection throughout the abdomen and into the blood.\n",

      "What is an arm fracture?": "When a bone breaks or cracks, the injury is called a fracture.\nIn the arm, a fracture most often occurs in the long and slender shaft of one of the three arm bones. The three arm bones are the humerus, radius, and ulna.\n",
      "Fractures of the humerus (upper arm bone)": "The humerus is the bone that extends from the shoulder to the elbow.\nIn otherwise healthy people, most fractures of the humerus are caused by a direct blow to the upper arm. This often is caused by a motor vehicle accident or high-impact fall. Less often, the humerus can fracture because of a severe twist of the upper arm, a fall on an outstretched arm, or an extreme contraction of upper arm muscles.\nIf the bone fractures because of an extreme muscle contraction, the break curves around the bone. This is sometimes called a spiral fracture or a \"ball-thrower's fracture.\" These injuries are fairly rare.\nIf the humerus breaks because of a low-impact bump or fall, this may mean that the bone has been weakened by an illness such as osteoporosis or cancer. These are called pathologic fractures. Cancer-related fractures of the upper arm bone tend to occur in older people. Trauma-related fractures of the humerus tend to affect younger people.\n",
      "Fractures of the radius and ulna (forearm fractures)": "The forearm contains two bones, the radius and the ulna. Both extend from the elbow to the wrist. The radius is on the same side of the arm as the thumb. The ulna is on the side of the little finger.\nWhen the forearm is fractured, either the radius or ulna may be fractured alone, or both bones may be fractured. In either case, the injury is almost always caused by a direct blow to the forearm, or by falling on an outstretched arm.\nAmong young Americans, forearm fractures are common in teenagers as a sports-related injury or skateboarding. Osteoporosis is a common risk factor for older persons with a forearm fracture.\n",
      "Symptoms of an arm fracture": "If you have fractured the shaft of your humerus, your symptoms may include:\nIf you have fractured one or both of the bones of your forearm, your symptoms will vary depending on the severity of your fracture. Symptoms may include:\n",
      "Diagnosing an arm fracture": "The doctor will review your symptoms. He or she will want to know:\nYour doctor will compare your injured arm with your uninjured one. He or she will check for:\nYour doctor will press gently and feel along the length of your arm to identify any areas of tenderness.\nYour doctor will feel your pulse and check your sensation and ability to move your arm and hand. This will help determine whether a sharp edge of broken bone has damaged any of your arm's blood vessels or nerves.\nThe doctor will order x-rays of the injured bone. Sometimes additional x-rays of the joints directly above and below the fracture will be ordered as well. The x-rays will confirm the location and severity of your fracture.\n",
      "Expected duration of an arm fracture": "Small fractures of the forearm heal in about four weeks when immobilized in a cast. More severe forearm fractures may need to be repaired surgically, and then immobilized for up to 12 weeks.\nSmall fractures of the humerus may heal within eight weeks in young, healthy patients. However, more serious humerus fractures may take more than 12 weeks to mend. This is especially true in elderly people.\nUp to six months of rehabilitation exercises can be necessary for muscle and strength to recover after forearm and humerus fractures.\n",
      "Preventing arm fractures": "If you have or are at risk of developing osteoporosis, talk to your doctor. Ask about strategies to improve bone strength and prevent age-related bone loss. Strategies may include:\nProtective gear can help to prevent arm fractures. Examples include wrist and elbow guards worn by skateboarders.\n",
      "Treating arm fractures": "",
      "Fractures of the humerus": "The vast majority of humerus fractures are treated without surgery. The arm can heal after it is immobilized in a cast, a special splint, or a functional brace.\nSurgery may be needed for a more severe fracture, or any open fracture with exposed bone. The humerus will be repaired with plates and screws, or a metal rod. If you have an open fracture you will be given antibiotics intravenously (into a vein). Antibiotics help prevent infection in the exposed bone or nearby tissues.\nOnce your fractured humerus starts to heal, you may need physical therapy. Physical therapy helps to restore normal strength in your arm muscles. It also restores normal range of motion in your elbow and shoulder.  A course of physical therapy for a fractured humerus usually takes several months.\n",
      "Fractures of the forearm": "It is common for the fragile bones in the forearm to be separated from each other during a fracture. Forearm motion is very important. As a result, only the mildest fractures — including those that are nondisplaced — are treated without surgery.  A typical treatment for a nondisplaced forearm fracture includes wearing a cast for six weeks.\nA more severe forearm fracture, or an open fracture with exposed bone, will be repaired surgically. Metal plates and screws may be used. If you have an open fracture you will be given antibiotics intravenously to prevent infection.\nYour doctor may prescribe physical therapy to help restore your arm's strength and mobility. For children with mild fractures, a few simple arm exercises may be enough to return the injured arm to normal. These exercises usually can be done at home. A cast is usually not required after forearm surgery. For people with forearm fractures due to osteoporosis, medications to improve bone health (such as calcium, vitamin D, and alendronate) are generally recommended; this can reduce the risk of future fractures.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if your arm hurts severely or pain lasts after an injury. He or she can determine if a bone may be fractured.\nYou also should see a health care professional after an injury that results in numbness or weakness in the hand or wrist. This is true even if the injury itself seemed minor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "For most fractures of the humerus, the outlook is excellent, especially in people ages 35 and younger. After proper treatment and rehabilitation, most patients regain full strength and range of motion in the injured arm.\nThe prognosis is also excellent for most forearm fractures. In most patients, the broken bones heal successfully.\n",

      "What is arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease?": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two disorders — Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis — marked by inflammation of the intestinal tract. They are thought to be autoimmune disorders in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the intestinal tract, and other parts of the body, although this is unproven.\nSome people with inflammatory bowel disease have a type of arthritis that is similar to rheumatoid arthritis in some ways. However, there are some important differences.\nWith the arthritis associated with IBD, inflammation tends to involve only a few large joints, and it tends not to involve both sides of the body equally. For example, it might affect the knee on one side and the ankle on the other. In rheumatoid arthritis, more joints, especially small ones in the hand and wrist, are involved, and joints on both sides of the body tend to be affected equally.\nAntibodies commonly found in the blood of people with rheumatoid arthritis are not usually present in the blood of people with IBD arthritis. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis associated with IBD may affect the lower spine, especially the sacroiliac joints, and is associated with a certain gene (called HLA-B27).\nThe bowel problems caused by inflammatory bowel disease usually appear before the arthritis develops. Occasionally the arthritis appears first and the inflammatory bowel disease is diagnosed months or even years later.\n",
      "Symptoms of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease": "Besides the symptoms of IBD on the intestinal tract (such as bloody diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, and fever), people with the arthritis of IBD have pain, swelling, and stiffness (particularly in the morning) in those joints that are inflamed. Symptoms tend to vary over time, sometimes better, sometimes worse.\nOften, but not always, the joint symptoms correlate with the bowel symptoms. That is, the joints tend to be more painful and swollen when the gastrointestinal symptoms are worse. Common complaints include low back pain that is worse in the morning and better when you exercise, limited joint motion, and gelling, which means developing more stiffness after not moving around much.\n",
      "Diagnosing arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease": "There is no test that can confirm the diagnosis of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, especially whether you have inflammatory bowel disease. He or she will look for typical symptoms, and will examine you to look for inflamed joints.\n",
      "Expected duration of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease": "Arthritis associated with IBD tends to be chronic (long-lasting), though it may get better and worse over time. Rarely, certain treatments can cause the arthritis to subside or even go away. For example, if a patient with ulcerative colitis has a colectomy (removal of the colon), the arthritis may disappear.\n",
      "Preventing arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease": "There is no known way to prevent IBD arthritis.\n",
      "Treating arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease": "There is no single best treatment for arthritis associated with IBD. Joint pain may be relieved by a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen or naproxen. IBD can cause bleeding in the intestinal tract, which can be made worse by a medication that thins the blood, including most NSAIDs. Any NSAID may worsen the intestinal inflammation caused by inflammatory bowel disease.\nFor more severe cases, injections of corticosteroids into the inflamed joint can provide prompt, though often temporary, relief. Other medications that may help include those that may be prescribed for the intestinal disease, such as sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), azathioprine (Imuran), or oral corticosteroids. Medications used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, such as methotrexate (Folex, Methotrexate LPF, Rheumatrex) can also be effective.\nNewer agents, such as injections of adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), and ustekinumab (Stelara)‎, may be quite effective for certain forms of IBD and related arthritis.\nIf joints become severely damaged, joint surgery, including joint replacement, may help.\nIt's important to strike a balance between rest and exercise. Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or podiatrist. Splints, shoe inserts, or braces can provide relief in ways that medications cannot.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have symptoms of IBD (including chronic diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, or recurring fever) or of arthritis (including joint pain, swelling, or limited motion).\n",
      "Prognosis": "With treatment, the outlook for IBD arthritis is generally good, although the condition is quite variable. Severe cases may be associated with significant joint damage and the need for surgery within a year or two, while other cases are much milder.\n",

      "What is asthma?": "Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung condition. Air passages narrow and become inflamed. This leads to breathing difficulties and wheezing.\nAsthma ranges from mild to severe. Some people have only occasional, mild symptoms. Others have nearly constant symptoms with severe, life-threatening flare-ups.\nDuring an asthma attack, the airways become inflamed. They narrow as the muscles surrounding them constrict. Mucus produced by the inflammation fills the narrowed passageways. As a result, the flow of air is partially or completely blocked.\nAsthma affects the lung's larger and smaller airways.\nWhat causes asthma-related inflammation is not clear. But several environmental \"triggers\" have been identified.\nMany asthma triggers are allergens. Allergens cause the immune system to overreact in some people. Common allergens include:\nAlso high on the list of asthma triggers are:\nFor some people with severe asthma, no specific triggers can be identified.\nAsthma can develop early, often before age 5. But its symptoms can begin at any age. The condition has a genetic (inherited) component. It often affects people with a family history of allergies.\n",
      "Symptoms of asthma": "Symptoms of asthma include:\nFor some people with asthma, a chronic cough is the main symptom.\nSymptoms of a severe asthma attack can include:\nBetween asthma attacks or flare-ups, people with mild or moderate asthma may not have any symptoms.\nIn some people, symptoms flare up only during or after exercise.\nPeople with asthma tend to have more severe symptoms when they have an upper respiratory infection such as a cold or the flu.\n",
      "Diagnosing asthma": "Your doctor will ask about:\nThese details will help your doctor find ways to help prevent your asthma attacks.\nYour doctor also will want to know about:\nYour doctor will listen to your back with a stethoscope to detect wheezing.\nDuring an attack, your doctor can assess the severity of your flare-up. He will listen for the amount of airflow in your lungs. He will also observe how you are using your chest muscles to breathe. Blue lips or skin are a sign that you are not getting enough oxygen.\nOther tests may be done in the office. These include measuring the speed of the air you can exhale forcibly. This is done with a device called a peak-flow meter.\nAnother test, called pulse oximetry, measures oxygen levels in your blood. It is done by placing a small plastic clip on the tip of your finger.\nDuring an asthma flare-up, blood tests may be done to check for infection. An arterial blood gas (ABG) test can be done on a blood sample. It provides a more accurate measure of oxygen levels. Your doctor also may want you to have a chest X-ray.\nTwo tests are commonly used to show how well your lungs are functioning:\nDuring spirometry, you exhale into a device that analyzes the amount and volume of airflow. One part of the test may be repeated after you are given a bronchodilator. This medication relaxes the muscles surrounding the airways. If airflow improves with a bronchodilator, it indicates that you have asthma.\nSometimes a challenge test is done when spirometry appears normal. For this test, you inhale a medication to see if it causes your airway muscles to tighten up. People with asthma are more sensitive to this medication: their airway muscles are more likely to tighten up.\nPeak-flow meters often are given to asthma patients for use at home. They can use them to monitor their asthma. These devices help to detect the earliest signs of an asthma flare-up.\nYour doctor may want to do a blood test or allergy skin testing. These tests are used to determine specific substances (\"allergens\") that can trigger an allergy.\n",
      "Expected duration of asthma": "Asthma in adults often is a lifelong condition. With treatment, symptoms can be controlled. They can be infrequent or very mild.\nIn about half of asthmatic children, the asthma goes away on its own. Or it becomes less severe over time. However, it may reappear later in life.\nAsthma episodes can go away on their own or with the help of asthma medications. Attacks vary in frequency and severity. It is often dependent on what triggers the attack.\n",
      "Preventing asthma": "Some asthma episodes can be prevented by avoiding or minimizing exposure to triggers.\nThese include environmental triggers such as:\nIf exercise triggers your asthma:\nEliminating allergens at home often can go a long way to control asthma symptoms.\nIf dust mites are a trigger:\nSome people may need to avoid animals entirely. Others may benefit from taking preventive medicine before an anticipated exposure to animals. Pet owners should keep pets out of bedrooms and bathe them regularly.\nThose who are affected by pollens should\nPrevention also means learning to anticipate future attacks. Monitor your symptoms and peak-flow readings to help identify a coming attack before symptoms develop. This allows you to adjust your medications to prevent an attack.\nEarly signs or symptoms of an asthma flare-up include:\n",
      "Treating asthma": "Treatment focuses on:\nIf you have chronic asthma, work with your doctor to write an asthma-management plan. The plan specifies:\nSeveral types of medication are available to treat asthma. Some treat acute attacks (the \"quick relievers\"). Others prevent attacks from happening (the \"controllers\").\nIt is important to take preventive asthma medications as prescribed. You should take them even when you are not having symptoms.\n\nSevere asthma attacks must be treated in a hospital. There, oxygen can be administered, and drugs may be given intravenously or with a nebulizer. In life-threatening cases, the patient may need a breathing tube placed in the large airway and artificial ventilation.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you or your child has persistent:\nSome children with asthma may not complain specifically of shortness of breath. However, they may flare their nostrils or use their chest and neck muscles when breathing. These are signs that they are having trouble.\nIf you already have been diagnosed with asthma, call your doctor if your symptoms:\nFor example, call your doctor if you must use your rescue bronchodilator more than two or three times a day. Also call if your peak-flow-meter readings are in the yellow or red zones.\nIf you have an asthma attack and your symptoms persist despite your usual medications, seek emergency help immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although asthma cannot be cured, it almost always can be controlled successfully. Most people with asthma lead relatively normal lives.\n",

      "What is astigmatism?": "Astigmatism means that the cornea of the eye has an irregular shape, causing vision problems. The cornea is the clear covering over the lens and the iris. It protects these structures and helps to transmit light through the eye. The cornea is normally spherical, although in people with astigmatism, it may be shaped like a football or oval. This causes light to scatter instead of focus on a single point as it passes through the cornea, resulting in blurred vision.\nTo continue reading this article, you mustlog in.\nSubscribe to Harvard Health Online for immediate access to health news and information from Harvard Medical School.\nI'd like to receive access to Harvard Health Online for only $4.99 a month.\nAlready a member?Login ».\n",

      "What is atherosclerosis?": "Atherosclerosis is the process of cholesterol plaque buildup in arteries. It can lead to a narrowing of the arteries that can significantly reduce the blood supply to vital organs such as the heart, brain, and intestines. In atherosclerosis, the arteries are narrowed when fatty deposits called plaques build up inside. Plaques typically contain cholesterol from low-density lipoproteins (LDL), smooth-muscle cells and fibrous tissue, and sometimes calcium.\nAs a plaque grows along the lining of an artery, it can sometimes rupture, leading to formation of a blood clot inside the artery, which can totally block blood flow. As a result, the organ supplied by the blocked artery starves for blood and oxygen. The organ's cells may either die or suffer severe damage.\nAtherosclerosis is the main cause of death and disability in industrialized nations, including the United States. This is because atherosclerosis is the underlying medical problem in most patients with any of the following illnesses:\nFactors that increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis include:\n",
      "Symptoms of atherosclerosis": "Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause any symptoms until blood supply to an organ is reduced. When this happens, symptoms vary, depending on the specific organ involved:\n",
      "Diagnosing atherosclerosis": "Your doctor will review your medical history, your current symptoms and any medications you are taking.\nYour doctor will ask you about your family history of heart disease, stroke and other circulatory problems, and your family history of high blood cholesterol. He or she will ask about cigarette smoking, your diet, and how much exercise you get.\nYour doctor will measure your blood pressure and heart rate. He or she will examine you, paying special attention to your circulation, sometimes listening to the arteries in the neck. The exam includes feeling for pulses in your neck, wrists, groin, and feet. Your doctor may check the blood pressure in your legs, to compare it to the pressure in your arms. The ratio of your blood pressure at your ankle to the blood pressure inside your elbow is called an ankle-brachial index or ABI.\nSigns of poor impaired circulation include:\nYour doctor will order blood tests to measure your total, LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, triglyceride level, fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c (a measure of blood sugars over the prior three months), and sometimes hs-CRP C-reactive protein, a marker for inflammation), and Lp(a) (lipoprotein(a), a fatty particle linked to a heightened risk of heart attack). A routine electrocardiogram (EKG) occasionally will uncover electrical changes in the heart that indicate poor blood flow to the heart muscle. Your doctor may order an EKG performed during an exercise stress test if you have any symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease.\nImaging tests such as CT scans or MRIs can sometimes be done (or reviewed if already done for a different reason). They can reveal calcium buildup (a sign of atherosclerosis) in arteries of the heart, the aorta, carotid arteries to the brain, or in the abdomen. A calcium score test is a CT scan of the heart to look for this buildup in the heart arteries. A carotid ultrasound is an ultrasound looking for cholesterol plaque or blockage in the arteries to the brain.\n",
      "Expected duration of atherosclerosis": "Atherosclerosis is a long-term condition that continues to worsen over many decades without changes in lifestyle and medication if necessary.\n",
      "Preventing atherosclerosis": "You can help to prevent atherosclerosis by changing your risk factors for the illness. You should practice a lifestyle that promotes good circulation and combats atherosclerosis:\n",
      "Treating atherosclerosis": "There is no cure for atherosclerosis, but treatment can slow or halt the worsening of the disease. The major treatment goal is to prevent significant narrowing of the arteries so that symptoms never develop and vital organs are never damaged. To do this, you would begin by following the healthy lifestyle outlined above.\nIf you have high cholesterol that cannot be controlled by diet and exercise, your doctor will likely recommend medication. The most common medicines used to lower cholesterol are statin drugs, also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Statins block an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which controls the production of cholesterol in the liver. Examples include:\nMany other non-statin classes of medication exist as well. These medications have been shown to reduce risk of heart events. they include:\nAnti-clotting medications such as aspirin, or other antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix), are often used as well. They can increase the risk of bleeding, so careful selection of which agent and for how long is needed.\nOnce symptoms of atherosclerosis-related organ damage develop, the specific treatment depends on the organ involved:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "It is possible to have atherosclerosis for many years without having symptoms. If you experience symptoms of an atherosclerosis-related medical condition, contact a doctor immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Atherosclerosis leads to the number one cause of death in the United States and many other countries: cardiovascular disease. However, people with atherosclerosis are living longer with better quality of life than ever before. For many, this is disease can be prevented. Even those people genetically programmed for atherosclerosis can delay the beginning and worsening of the disease with a healthy lifestyle, the right foods, and medication to lower LDL cholesterol.\n",

      "What is athlete's foot (tinea pedis)?": "Athlete's foot, also known as tinea pedis, is a common foot infection caused by fungi called dermatophytes. Found in many different places indoors and outdoors, dermatophytes are especially common in the warm, moist environments of pools, showers, locker rooms and other sports facilities, where people walk with bare feet. Once dermatophytes contaminate the skin of a foot, the warm, moist environment of sweaty socks and shoes encourages them to grow.\n",
      "Symptoms of athlete's foot (tinea pedis)": "Symptoms of athlete's foot include:\n\nRedness and scaling on the soles.\nIn most people, signs of infection are seen on the webbed skin between the toes. In some people, the infection spreads to one or more toenails, causing the nail to appear unusually thick and cloudy yellow.\n",
      "Diagnosing athlete's foot (tinea pedis)": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and about factors that make you more likely to develop athlete's foot, such as your use of public sports facilities, clubs or showers. Your doctor will ask about the type of shoes and socks you wear, what kind of work you do and what you wear on your feet to work.\nYour doctor usually can diagnose athlete's foot simply by looking at your feet. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor can gently scrape some flakes of skin from a scaly portion of your foot onto a slide. The dermatophytes that cause the infection often show up under a microscope.\n",
      "Expected duration of athlete's foot (tinea pedis)": "It usually takes several weeks to months for the infection to respond to treatment. Even after proper medical treatment, the infection can return easily if your feet are exposed again to fungi and sweaty, warm conditions. For this reason, many people have athlete's foot infection that lasts or keeps returning for many years. Successfully curing the infection often requires changes in how you care for your feet and what you wear on your feet.\n",
      "Preventing athlete's foot (tinea pedis)": "You can help to prevent athlete's foot by keeping your feet clean and dry. More specifically, you can try the following:\n",
      "Treating athlete's foot (tinea pedis)": "There are many effective topical medications, including ciclopirox (Loprox), clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex), econazole (Spectazole), ketoconazole (Nizoral), miconazole (Micatin), naftifine (Naftin), oxiconazole (Oxistat), sulconazole (Exelderm), terbinafine (Lamisil), terconazole (Terazol), and tolnaftate (Desenex, Tinactin and others). Some are available without a prescription. Many weeks of treatment may be necessary. For people with long-standing or recurring athlete's foot, topical antifungal drugs may relieve symptoms without actually curing the infection.\nMedications by mouth can be more successful at curing an infection. However, you still can be susceptible to recurrences, and oral medications may be more likely to cause side effects. These require a prescription and include griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Grifulvin, Grisactin), itraconazole (Sporanox) and terbinafine (Lamisil).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you think you have athlete's foot, try a nonprescription antifungal ointment, cream or powder. Keep your feet as dry and clean as possible. If these measures do not help, make an appointment to see your doctor. Call your doctor for a more urgent evaluation and treatment if you see spreading redness or have fevers.\nIf you have diabetes and any foot problems, see your doctor right away. People with diabetes easily get skin infections, so they should see a doctor as soon as anything unusual appears on their feet.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Several weeks of treatment with a medication applied to the feet can usually cure athlete's feet in people with new or short-term symptoms. Chronic or recurring athlete's foot infections also can be cured this way, but may require significant changes in foot care and several weeks of treatment. More severe cases may call for an oral medication. Even after successful treatment, people remain at risk of re-infection if they do not follow prevention guidelines. Relapses are common.\n",

      "What is atrial fibrillation?": "Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder that causes a rapid and irregular heartbeat.\nThe heart is a muscle that has four chambers through which blood flows. The two upper chambers are the atria. The two lower chambers are the ventricles.\nAtrial fibrillation affects the atria. Normally, the muscular walls of the atria contract at the same time, pumping blood into the lower two chambers (the ventricles). Then the walls of the ventricles contract at the same time, pumping blood to the rest of the body.\nFor the heart to work efficiently, the atria need to pump first, followed by the ventricles. How is this coordinated? Normally, each heartbeat starts with an electrical impulse that comes from a small part of the atrium called the sinus node. That signal first causes the atria to beat, pumping blood into the ventricles. Then the signal travels to another part of the heart called the atrioventricular node. From there, the signal travels down to the ventricles, and causes them to beat, sending blood throughout the body.\nIn contrast, during atrial fibrillation, instead of one coordinated signal that causes all parts of the atria to pump at the same time, there are multiple uncoordinated signals. Instead of pumping efficiently, the atria just quiver.\nAs a result, the atria do not pump all of their blood into the ventricles. Also, the ventricles sometimes pump when they don't have much blood in them. So the heart is not pumping efficiently.\nIn atrial fibrillation, the heartbeat is rapid and irregular. A normal heartbeat is 60 to 100 beats per minute, and very regular: beat...beat...beat...beat. During atrial fibrillation, the heart beats at 80 to 160 beats per minute, and is very irregular: beat..beat.....beat....beat.beat.beat....beat.\nSuch blood clots can cause serious problems. They can travel out of the heart and get stuck in an artery to the lungs (causing a pulmonary embolism), an artery to the brain (causing a stroke) or an artery elsewhere in the body. Atrial fibrillation can lead to the formation of blood clots inside the atria. That's because blood tends to form clots when it's not moving. The quivering atria don't move all of the blood along to the ventricles. Some blood just pools inside the atria, and the pool of still blood tends to form clots.\n\nThe major factors that increase the risk of atrial fibrillation are:\n",
      "Symptoms of atrial fibrillation": "Atrial fibrillation often doesn't cause any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include:\nSome people with atrial fibrillation have periods of normal heartbeats: the atrial fibrillation comes and goes. In many others, the atrial fibrillation becomes a constant condition, one that remains for the rest of their lives.\n",
      "Diagnosing atrial fibrillation": "Your doctor will:\nThe diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is usually confirmed with an electrocardiogram (EKG). An EKG is a test that records the heart's electrical activity. However, because atrial fibrillation can come and go, a standard EKG can make the diagnosis only if you are having the irregular rhythm at the time the EKG is performed.\nFor cases of atrial fibrillation that comes and goes, an ambulatory EKG may be done. During this test, the patient wears a portable EKG machine (Holter monitor). The Holter monitor is usually worn for 24 hours. Longer-term monitoring is also possible that can last for two to four weeks.\nIf your symptoms appear less frequently than once a day, your doctor may use an event recorder or longer-term \"patch\" monitors the size of an oversized Band-Aid. You keep an event recorder with you for several days or even weeks.\n",
      "Expected duration of atrial fibrillation": "How long the condition lasts depends on the cause. Atrial fibrillation caused by a treatable condition may go away when the condition is treated.\nHowever, atrial fibrillation is often a lifelong condition. This is more likely when it has no known cause or results from a long-standing cardiac disorder.\n",
      "Preventing atrial fibrillation": "Some causes of atrial fibrillation cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treating atrial fibrillation": "Treatment depends on the cause.\nIf the cause is coronary artery disease, treatment may consist of:\nAtrial fibrillation caused by an excess of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism) can be treated with medication or surgery to address the underlying condition. When rheumatic heart disease is the cause, the condition may be treated with surgery to repair or replace heart valves damaged by the disease.\nThere are three main areas of treatment, all of which need to be addressed:\n",
      "Treatment of the first attack": "When a person develops persistent atrial fibrillation for the first time (or the first few times), doctors often try to restore a normal heart rhythm. This is particularly true if a person is having bothersome symptoms (like shortness of breath or weakness) from atrial fibrillation. Even if the person is not having symptoms, there is a reason to try to restore a normal rhythm: the longer the heart is left to remain in atrial fibrillation, the harder it is to restore a normal heart rhythm.\nSeveral different medicines are used to restore a normal heart rhythm. A first step for those who remain in atrial fibrillation is electrical cardioversion: a small shock is delivered to the chest, and the electricity can \"reset\" the heart to a normal rhythm. This procedure is done with brief anesthesia and works in most cases. But more than half of patients eventually develop atrial fibrillation again.\n",
      "Restoring a normal heart rhythm when atrial fibrillation recurs": "To keep the heart from repeatedly going back into atrial fibrillation, your doctor may recommend radiofrequency catheter ablation. This procedure is typically performed in a catheterization laboratory of a hospital. The procedure uses radio waves to destroy the tissue in the heart that is triggering the abnormal electrical rhythms that cause atrial fibrillation. If it is effective in eliminating recurrent attacks of atrial fibrillation, then it also eliminates the symptoms caused by atrial fibrillation. For patients who maintain normal rhythm for more than a year, sometimes blood thinning medications can be stopped.\nUnfortunately, radiofrequency catheter ablation is not always effective, and also can have complications. Talk to your doctor about the balance of benefits and risks.\n",
      "Keeping a normal heart rhythm": "When a normal heart rhythm has been restored, several different medicines may be given to try to hold the heart in a normal rhythm. This is called rhythm control.\nSometimes, high doses of beta-blocker drugs can hold the heart in a normal rhythm. These drugs have relatively few serious adverse effects. For most patients, however, the most potent drugs for keeping the heart out of atrial fibrillation are the antiarrhythmic drugs, such as amiodarone. Although these drugs are generally effective at keeping the heart rhythm regular, they also can have serious side effects.\n",
      "Slowing the heart rate": "Sometimes—usually after the heart has slipped back into atrial fibrillation several times, despite treatment — doctors decide it is better to leave the heart in atrial fibrillation. When that happens, the heart rate usually needs to be slowed down to help the heart work most efficiently. This is called rate control.\nMedicines used to slow the heart rate include beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and digoxin.\n",
      "Rhythm control versus rate control": "A recent study has found that for patients who have developed atrial fibrillation in the past year, a strategy of rhythm control with either medication or ablation does lead to a lower risk of heart events. thus, discussing the strategy with your doctor is important.\n",
      "Anticoagulation": "For anyone who has chronic atrial fibrillation, or who may be going in and out of atrial fibrillation without knowing it (because it doesn't cause them symptoms), the risk of blood clots needs to be reduced. This requires \"blood thinning\" drugs known as anticoagulants.\nAn assessment of the risk of stroke, the major complication of atrial fibrillation, is always performed in deciding on whether to use anticoagulation. Doctors use a simple but surprisingly accurate method to estimate your risk of stroke if you have atrial fibrillation. It's a score, on a scale of 0 to 9, that predicts the chance of stroke from afib in any given year.\nThe method is called the CHA2DS2-VASc score. It's an acronym for the eight major risk factors for stroke that add one or more points to your overall score:\nGuidelines recommend anticoagulation for those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater, although benefit has also been seen in some studies for those with a score of 1.\nThe several different blood thinning drugs all have a risk: a drug that reduces the tendency of blood to clot thereby increases the risk of bleeding (since clots are a protective mechanism the body uses to try to stop bleeding).\nTraditionally, the drug warfarin (Coumadin) has been used for anticoagulation. New guidelines recommend anticoagulation with drugs called direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This means they have normal heart valves. The DOACs include apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. These drugs increasingly are used instead of warfarin.\nThe DOACs do not require periodic blood tests, which are necessary with warfarin. They also may have a lower risk of bleeding. On the other hand, they are considerably more expensive, and because they are new there is less known about their possible long term side effects.\nThe alternative to a DOAC is warfarin. Millions of people have taken this drug, over the past 70 years. Doctors have lots of experience in using it, and lots of knowledge about its possible side effects. Warfarin also needs to be monitored regularly: you need periodic blood tests to make sure the dose of warfarin has thinned the blood just enough and not too much.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have any of the symptoms of atrial fibrillation. This includes:\n",
      "Prognosis": "When a cause of atrial fibrillation is identified and treated, the arrhythmia often goes away. It is less likely to go away in people who have long-standing rheumatic heart disease or any condition in which the atria are enlarged.\nBlood thinning medications can reduce the risk of a stroke or other complications.\n",

      "What is ADHD?": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), usually first diagnosed in childhood, can appear in a variety of forms and has many possible causes. People with ADHD probably have an underlying genetic vulnerability to developing it, but the severity of the problem is also influenced by the environment. Conflict and stress tend to make it worse.\nThe main features of this disorder are found in its name. Attention problems include daydreaming, difficulty focusing, and being easily distracted. Hyperactivity refers to fidgeting or restlessness. A person with the disorder may be disruptive or impulsive, may have trouble in relationships, and may be accident-prone. Hyperactivity and impulsiveness often improve as a person matures, but attention problems tend to last into adulthood.\nADHD is the most common problem seen in outpatient child and adolescent mental health settings. It is estimated that ADHD affects more than 5% of children. Boys are diagnosed with ADHD about twice as much as girls.\nADHD can continue into adulthood. The activity component is less apparent in adults, who tend to have problems with memory and concentration. They may have trouble staying organized and meeting commitments at work or at home. The consequence of poor functioning may be anxiety, low self-esteem, or mood problems. Some people turn to substances to manage these feelings.\n",
      "Symptoms of ADHD": "The symptoms of ADHD — inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsive behavior — often show up first at school. A teacher may report to parents that their child won't listen, is \"hyper,\" or causes trouble and is disruptive. A child with ADHD often wants to be a good student, but the symptoms get in the way. Teachers, parents, and friends may be unsympathetic because they see the child's behavior as bad or odd.\nA high level of activity and occasional impulsiveness or inattentiveness is often normal in a child. But the hyperactivity of ADHD is typically more haphazard, poorly organized, and has no real purpose. And in children with ADHD, these behaviors are frequent enough that the child has a harder-than-average time learning, getting along with others, or staying reasonably safe.\nADHD symptoms can vary widely. Here are common characteristics of the disorder in the two major groups (inattention and hyperactivity).\n",
      "Inattention": "",
      "Hyperactivity": "Many children with ADHD also show symptoms of other behavioral or psychiatric conditions. In fact, such problems may be different ways that the same underlying biological or environmental problems come to light. These associated conditions include learning disabilities and disorders characterized by disruptive behavior.\n",
      "Diagnosing ADHD": "There is no single test to diagnose ADHD. For a child, a pediatrician may make the diagnosis or may make a referral to a specialist. Parents and teachers may be alert to the problem and may have the child evaluated. For adults, a mental health professional generally performs the evaluation.\nThe clinician will ask about symptoms related to ADHD. Since, in children, many of these characteristics are seen in a school setting, the clinician will also ask about behavior in school. To help collect this information, the evaluator will often interview parents, teachers, and other caregivers or ask them to fill out special behavioral checklists.\nSince other conditions may cause the symptoms of ADHD, the medical history and physical examination are important. For example, the doctor may look for trouble with hearing or vision, learning disabilities, speech problems, seizure disorders, anxiety, depression, or other behavior problems. In some cases, other medical or psychological testing may be useful to check for one or more of these conditions. These tests can sometimes help clinicians and teachers develop practical suggestions.\n",
      "Expected duration of ADHD": "In most children with ADHD, symptoms begin before age 12 and last through adolescence. Symptoms of ADHD may continue into adulthood.\n",
      "Risk factors and prevention": "The causes of ADHD are not fully understood. There are numerous factors that are associated with the development of ADHD. It may be difficult to avoid these factors, but addressing them may reduce the risk of developing the disorder.\n",
      "Common risk factors": "",
      "Treating ADHD": "Although no treatment eliminates ADHD completely, many helpful options are available. The goal of treatment is to help children improve social relationships, do better in school, and keep their disruptive or harmful behaviors to a minimum. Medication can be very helpful, and it is often necessary.\nDrug treatment by itself is rarely the answer. Medication and psychotherapy together usually have the best results. For example, a behavioral program may be put in place where structured, realistic expectations are set.\nStimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and forms of amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine) have been used for many decades. They are relatively safe and effective for most children to help them focus their thoughts and control their behavior. Long-acting forms of stimulants are usually preferred for children, because one dose in the morning can provide a daylong effect.\nDespite their name, stimulants do not cause increased hyperactivity or impulsivity. If the disorder has been properly diagnosed, the medication should have the opposite effect. Common mild side effects are decreased appetite, weight loss, stomachaches, sleep problems, headaches, and jitteriness. Adjusting the dose can often help eliminate these problems. Stimulant drugs are associated with some serious concerns and side effects, including:\nSince such risks vary widely depending on the individual, it is important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment with your doctor.\nAnother potential problem, which strictly speaking is not a side effect, is that stimulants can find their way to people other than the person being treated for ADHD. Called diversion, it is fairly common among adolescents and young adults. The drugs are most often taken to improve academic performance. Some individuals do take stimulants to get high.\nOther nonstimulant medications are also available to treat ADHD. These are especially useful when there is reluctance to start a stimulant. Atomoxetine (Strattera) or viloxazine (Qelbree) can be effective for treating ADHD. They work by a different chemical mechanism than stimulants. The antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin) is helpful in some cases. Two other medicines — guanfacine and clonidine — also have shown some benefit for ADHD symptoms, but they have weaker effects than stimulants.\nOther treatment approaches, used alone or in combination, may include:\nBecause many children with ADHD also are troubled by poor grades and school behavior problems, schools may need to provide educational adjustments and interventions (such as an individualized educational plan) to promote the best possible learning environment for the child.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if your child shows symptoms of ADHD, or if teachers notify you that your child is having academic difficulties, behavioral problems, or difficulty paying attention.\n",
      "Prognosis": "ADHD can cause significant emotional, social, and educational problems. However, when ADHD is diagnosed early and treated properly, the condition can be managed effectively, so children can grow up to have productive, successful, and fulfilling lives. Although some children appear to grow out of their ADHD as they reach their adolescent years, others have lifelong symptoms.\n",

      "What is back pain?": "Back pain can be a symptom of many different illnesses and conditions. The main cause of the pain can be a problem with the back itself or by a problem in another part of the body. In many cases, doctors can't find a cause for the pain. When a cause is found, common explanations include:\nRarer causes include:\n",
      "Symptoms of back pain": "Back pain varies widely. Some symptoms (often called \"red flag\" symptoms) may suggest that the back pain has a more serious cause. These include fever, recent trauma, weight loss, a history of cancer and neurological symptoms, such as numbness, weakness or incontinence (involuntary loss of urine or stool).\nBack pain is often accompanied by other symptoms that may help point to its cause. For example:\n",
      "Diagnosing back pain": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and your medical history. He or she will examine your back muscles and spine and will move you certain ways to check for pain, muscle tenderness or weakness, stiffness, numbness or abnormal reflexes. For example, if you have a disk problem, you may have pain in your lower back when the doctor raises your straightened leg.\nYour symptoms and the physical examination may give your doctor enough information to diagnose the problem. However, with back pain, your doctor may only be able to tell you that the problem is not serious. If your doctor determines that your back pain is caused by muscle strain, obesity, pregnancy or another cause that is not urgent, you may not need any additional tests. However, if he or she suspects a more serious problem involving your vertebrae or spinal nerves, especially if your back pain has lasted longer than 12 weeks, you may need one or more of the following tests:\n",
      "Expected duration of back pain": "How long back pain lasts depends on its cause. For example, if your pain is caused by strain from overexertion, symptoms usually subside over days or weeks and you may be able to return gradually to your normal activities. However, you should avoid heavy lifting, prolonged sitting or sudden bending or twisting until your back gets better.\nWomen who have back pain caused by the added weight of pregnancy almost always will get better after delivery. People who are obese may need to lose weight before back pain eases.\nPeople with back pain caused by pyelonephritis often begin to feel better within days after they start taking antibiotics, although they usually need to continue taking antibiotics for up to two weeks.\nPeople with more serious forms of back pain caused by problems with the vertebrae or spinal nerves may have more persistent back pain that lasts for months and may last for years.\n",
      "Preventing back pain": "You can help prevent some forms of back pain by strengthening your back with exercises and by avoiding activities that lead to back injury. Measures that may help prevent back pain include:\nTo help prevent osteoporosis, make sure you get enough calcium and vitamin D daily to meet the dietary requirements for your age group. Follow a routine program of weight-bearing exercise. Avoid smoking and limit the amount of alcohol you drink. If you are a woman who has entered menopause, speak with your doctor about testing for osteoporosis and medications that can help to prevent or reverse it. Screening men for osteoporosis is controversial, but some guidelines recommend bone density testing for men ages 70 and older.\n",
      "Treating back pain": "Most episodes of back pain are not serious and may be treated with:\nPeople with back pain are encouraged to return to their normal activities gradually, and to temporarily avoid heavy lifting, prolonged sitting, or sudden bending or twisting.\nIf you are recovering from back pain, your doctor may ask you to call or return to his or her office for a follow-up visit in about two weeks to confirm that your symptoms are gone and that you can safely resume all of your normal activities.\nIf your back pain is related to more serious disorders of the vertebrae or spinal nerves or if it hasn't improved over a few weeks, you may be referred to a specialist, such as a pain specialist, an orthopedic surgeon (a doctor who specializes in diseases of the bones), a neurologist (a doctor who specializes in diseases of the nerves and brain) or a rheumatologist (an arthritis specialist).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if:\n",
      "Prognosis": "More than 90% of people with back pain get better after conservative treatment. Only 5% of people with back pain will have symptoms for more than 12 weeks and even among these people, the cause is usually not serious.\n",

      "What is a barium enema?": "A barium enema is a procedure used to examine the lining of the colon and rectum. The procedure is also called a lower gastrointestinal series.\nBarium refers to barium sulfate, a chalky chemical that appears white on X-ray film. Enema refers to any fluid pumped into the rectum through the anus. After the barium sulfate liquid makes its way to your intestines, a series of X-ray pictures are taken. In these X-rays, the white barium fluid allows some abnormalities in the lining of the intestines to appear dark. Air may be pumped into the intestine during this procedure to help sharpen the outline of the intestinal wall.\n\nThis test takes about 45 minutes. It can be done as an outpatient procedure, meaning you don't have to stay overnight in a hospital. Although the X-rays themselves are painless, the enema may cause some slight discomfort. You may feel full or gassy.\n",
      "What a barium enema is used for": "Barium enema is sometimes used to check for tumors of the colon and rectum. It also can check for polyps (abnormal growths attached to the intestinal lining by a stalk), diverticulosis or other problems. It is rarely ordered today because other tests, such as colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy (a type of contrast enema using a CT scanner), provide much better detail.\n",
      "Preparing for a barium enema": "Your colon and rectum need to be empty for the procedure. Your doctor will give you instructions about using laxatives and/or enemas before the procedure. Your doctor will also tell you when to stop eating and what you can drink.\n",
      "How a barium enema is done": "You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown. You will lie on your side on an X-ray table. A tube will be inserted into your rectum and you will be given an enema of barium fluid. As the fluid flows into your intestines, you may feel a little discomfort, pressure or the urge to move your bowels. While you hold the fluid inside your bowels, the X-ray technician will take a series of pictures. To allow the barium fluid to flow into different parts of your bowels, you will change position on the table, and the table itself may be rotated.\nOnce the X-rays are complete, you will go to a nearby bathroom (or be given a bedpan) to pass the barium fluid from your bowels. You will then have a second series of X-rays. This time, air is gently pumped into your rectum. This air, together with the thin film of barium fluid still in your intestines, will help to enhance the images of your intestinal lining.\n",
      "Follow-up of a barium enema": "A radiologist will examine your X-rays and give the results to your doctor. Your doctor can then share the results with you.\nTo help clear the remaining barium fluid from your bowel, your doctor will give you instructions about drinking water, taking laxatives or using an enema at home. For a few days, while the barium clears, you will notice that your stools are an unusually light color.\n",
      "Risks of a barium enema": "Barium enema is a safe X-ray examination. There is a small risk of your intestines becoming blocked if the barium fluid does not clear from your bowel. This can be prevented by following your doctor's directions for cleansing the bowel after the procedure.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have abdominal or rectal pain, nausea, vomiting or blood in your stool after your barium enema. Call your doctor if your stools do not return to a normal color, if you have trouble moving your bowels, or if your stools become very narrow (as thin as a pencil).\n",

      "What is barotrauma?": "Barotrauma refers to injuries caused by increased air or water pressure, such as during airplane flights or scuba diving. Barotrauma of the ear is common. Generalized barotraumas, also called decompression sickness, affects the entire body.\nYour middle ear includes the eardrum and the space behind it. The only connection between your middle ear and the \"outside world\" is a thin canal called the Eustachian tube. This connects your ear with the back of your mouth. When you swallow, you may notice a small click in your ears. This is a bubble of air being moved through the Eustachian tube. These bubbles are constantly moving into the middle ear, where they balance the ear's inner pressure. Ear barotrauma can occur when these tubes become blocked or partially blocked.\nOn an airplane, barotrauma to the ear – also called aero-otitis or barotitis – can happen as the plane descends for landing. Barotrauma of the ear also can happen when scuba divers descend. The pressure change can create a vacuum in the middle ear that pulls the eardrum inward. This can cause pain and can muffle sounds. Your ear will feel stuffed and you may feel as if you need to \"pop\" it.\nIn more severe cases of barotrauma, the middle ear can fill with clear fluid as the body tries to equalize the pressure on both sides of the eardrum. This fluid is drawn out of blood vessels in the lining of the inner ear, and can only drain if the Eustachian tube is open. Fluid behind the eardrum is called serous otitis media. It can create pain and hearing difficulty similar to a middle ear infection.\n\nThe eardrum can rupture (break) in severe cases of ear barotrauma, causing bleeding or leaking of fluid from the ear. A ruptured eardrum can result in hearing loss. In severe cases, it is possible for the pressure to create a leak between the deepest structures of the ear (the fluid-filled bony canals called the cochlea and semicircular canals) and the inner ear space. This deep leak is known as a fistula. If this occurs, the balance center can be affected, resulting in a sensation of spinning or falling called vertigo. This complication may require emergency surgery.\nBarotrauma is the most common medical problem reported by air travelers. It is much more likely to happen to people who have colds, allergies or infections when they are flying. It is common in children because their Eustachian tubes are narrower than those of adults and become blocked more easily.\nBarotrauma in the lungs also can occur, but this is not seen in air travelers. It occurs, rarely, in divers who hold their breath, when the diaphragm moves abruptly in a \"gasping\" effort. The diaphragm is the main muscle used in breathing. This form of barotrauma creates a vacuum in the lungs and can result in bleeding into the lung tissue. A more common form of barotrauma in the lungs is caused by the mechanical ventilation systems used in hospital intensive care units to help patients breathe. In this case, air sacks (alveoli) in the lungs may be ruptured or scarred due to high air pressure within the lungs. Ventilator-associated barotrauma is a complex medical concern.\n",
      "Symptoms of barotrauma": "Common symptoms of ear barotrauma include:\nMore severe signs include:\nBarotrauma of the lungs associated with scuba diving can result in coughing up blood after diving, although this is rare.\n",
      "Diagnosising barotrauma": "You can diagnose a mild case of ear barotrauma yourself, and you do not need to see a doctor. If you are uncertain about your symptoms or if your symptoms last a long time, a doctor can examine your middle ear with a lighted magnifying tool called an otoscope to see if the eardrum is pulled inward. Clear fluid behind the eardrum sometimes can be difficult to see. If a collection of fluid is not visible, your doctor may squeeze a puff of air into your ear canal. If the eardrum does not move well, you probably have fluid behind the eardrum. A perforated eardrum can be diagnosed by looking at the ear with an otoscope.\n",
      "Expected duration of barotrauma": "Symptoms usually occur only during the change in pressure, and perhaps for a short time afterward. More severe cases, including serous otitis media, can last longer, perhaps weeks or months. Perforations of the eardrum often heal on their own, but this can take weeks. You may not be able to hear as well until the ear is fully healed. If your perforation has not healed after two months, you may need surgery to prevent permanent hearing loss.\n",
      "Preventioning barotrauma": "To prevent barotrauma, your Eustachian tubes must stay open. If you have a cold, ear infection or allergy, you may want to reschedule airplane travel until you are better. If you or your child must fly with a cold, infection or allergy, take a decongestant about one hour before your flight. Continue taking the medication during the flight according to the package directions. You also can use a decongestant nasal spray. Antihistamines may also be helpful. Ear plugs have been developed that can slow down the pressure change that affects the ear. These might give your ears some additional time to adjust to pressure changes. These plugs can be used for air travel but they are not useful for diving.\nDuring a flight, make sure you are awake for the landing so you can \"pop\" your ears if necessary. (If you ask, a flight attendant will wake you.) Infants should be kept awake during a flight's descent and can be given a bottle or pacifier to suck on to help keep their Eustachian tubes open. Keep the child upright as the plane descends.\n",
      "Treating barotrauma": "If you experience the symptoms of barotrauma during a flight, there are several things you can do:\nMost cases of persistent barotrauma of the ear can be treated with decongestants. In unusually persistent cases, an ear, nose and throat doctor may have to make a small incision in the eardrum to equalize the pressure and drain the fluid. If you have a ruptured eardrum, you need to keep water out of your ear to prevent infection. A perforation of the eardrum that has not healed after two months may need to be repaired surgically.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience dizziness that includes a feeling of spinning or falling (vertigo) and your symptoms occur right after flying or diving, you need to be evaluated by a doctor immediately because there is a small chance you may need emergency ear surgery. If you have severe pain, bleeding or drainage of fluid from your ears, see a doctor within several days because you may have a ruptured eardrum. If you have mild ear pain or hearing difficulty that continues after flying or diving, you should see a doctor for help if your symptoms are slow to go away.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most cases of barotrauma get better quickly without complications.\n",

      "What is a Bartholin's gland cyst?": "A cyst is a sac filled with liquid or semisolid material that forms under the skin or somewhere inside the body. The Bartholin's gland is one of two small glands on each side of the labia minora, just outside of the opening to the vagina. During sexual arousal, the Bartholin's gland releases a lubricating fluid. A Bartholin's gland cyst develops when the gland becomes blocked. The Bartholin's gland can become blocked for a variety of reasons, such as infection, inflammation or long-term irritation.\n\n",
      "Symptoms of a Bartholin's gland cyst": "Many Bartholin's gland cysts don't cause any symptoms. They usually are discovered when a woman notices a small, painless mass just outside the opening to the vagina, or when a physician notices it during a routine pelvic examination. However, if the cyst grows larger than 1 inch in diameter, it can cause discomfort when sitting, or during intercourse. If a cyst becomes infected, it fills with pus, and becomes firm, swollen, and very painful, making it difficult for a woman to sit, walk or have intercourse. The pus-filled cyst is called an abscess.\n",
      "Diagnosing a Bartholin's gland cyst": "Your doctor will diagnose a Bartholin's cyst by looking at it. He or she can tell if the cyst is infected by the way it looks and your symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration of a Bartholin's gland cyst": "With proper care, a Bartholin's gland cyst can clear up in a few days to a few weeks.\n",
      "Preventing a Bartholin's gland cyst": "When you first notice mild tenderness or a small lump, use warm towel compresses to help to drain the gland and cyst and to prevent infection.\n",
      "Treating a Bartholin's gland cyst": "If you have mild swelling but no cyst or if you have a cyst that is soft, apply warm compresses. That may be all you need to relieve the blockage and help to fight infection. Over-the-counter pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and other brand names) may help to relieve pain and calm inflammation.\nIf the cyst turns into a larger abscess with pus, it must be drained. This procedure can be done in a doctor's office. The area is numbed with a spray or small-needle injection. Using a scalpel, the doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, which releases the pus. The release of pressure leads to immediate pain relief. With a larger abscess, a temporary drain or packing gauze may be placed inside the healing cyst.\nYou may need to take antibiotics if infection spreads to the surrounding skin and genital area. Sometimes, cyst infections continue to return. To prevent repeat infections, you may need a minor surgical procedure that can be done in the doctor's office.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you feel an area of tenderness around the opening of the vagina and it doesn't respond to warm compresses, or it becomes larger or more painful, make an appointment to see a health care professional. Also call a health care professional if you have a lump or tender area near the vagina, and you develop a fever.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The chance is good that this problem will clear up quickly. A Bartholin's gland cyst may respond to warm compresses alone within a few days. When an abscess forms that requires an incision, healing may take a few days to weeks, depending on the size of the abscess. Recurring cysts and abscesses treated with an office surgical procedure may take longer to heal. These procedures, however, are highly effective at preventing infections from coming back.\n",

      "What is basal cell carcinoma?": "Basal cell cancer is the most common form of skin cancer diagnosed in the United States.\nBasal cells are small, round skin cells normally found in the upper part of your skin. When these cells become cancerous, they usually turn into small skin tumors that can destroy skin and nearby tissues. They can grow large over time, causing damage around and under them. Basal cell tumors rarely spread beyond the original cancer site.\nBasal cell cancer can grow on any part of the body. However, most basal cell cancers are found on some part of the face. This can cause disfigurement, and can interfere with the function of the eyelids, nose, and mouth.\n\nBasal cell cancer often develops because of repeated, long-term exposure to the sun. People with light skin and blue eyes are at particularly high risk. Less often, basal cell cancer may be caused by exposure to arsenic or certain industrial pollutants. Older people who received X-ray treatment for acne as teenagers are at higher risk of developing basal cell cancer.\n",
      "Symptoms of basal cell carcinoma": "Basal cell skin cancer usually appears as a tiny, painless bump with a pink, pearly surface. As the cancer slowly grows, the center of the bump may become sore and develop into a crater that bleeds, crusts, or forms a scab.\n\nA rare type of basal cell cancer may look like a small scar.\nAlthough it is commonly located on the face, basal cell cancer can develop on the ears, back, neck and other skin surfaces frequently exposed to the sun.\n",
      "Diagnosing basal cell carcinoma": "Your doctor will examine your skin. He or she will do a biopsy, which involves removing skin so it can be examined in a laboratory. The doctor may remove some, or all, of the abnormal skin for the biopsy.\n",
      "Expected duration of basal cell carcinoma": "Once a basal cell cancer develops on the skin, it usually grows slowly. It can become very large, especially if it is on your lower back, the back of your shoulder or some other area that you do not usually see in the mirror.\n",
      "Preventing basal cell carcinoma": "Unprotected exposure to sunlight increases your risk of developing basal cell cancer. You can help to reduce this risk in several ways:\nIf a basal cell cancer develops on your skin, early detection may limit damage. Examine your skin thoroughly every one to two months. Use a mirror to check your skin on less visible areas, such as your back, shoulders, upper arms, buttocks and the soles of your feet.\n",
      "Treating basal cell carcinoma": "Determining the right treatment depends on many factors, including:\nTreatments for superficial basal cell cancer with low risk of recurrence include:\nLess invasive treatments for low-risk superficial basal cell cancer include:\nThe most common treatments for larger basal cell cancers with a higher risk of recurrence are:\nOnce treatment is finished and the cancer is gone, the doctor will schedule regular follow up skin examinations. Once you have been diagnosed with basal cell cancer, you are at higher risk to develop another basal cell cancer.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor or a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin problems) if you notice:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is usually excellent. Most basal cell cancers are cured if they are treated early.\n",

      "What is a bedsore (decubitus ulcer)?": "Bedsores, also called pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, are areas of broken skin that can develop in people who:\nBedsores are common in people in hospitals and nursing homes and in people being cared for at home. Bedsores form where the weight of the person's body presses the skin against the firm surface of the bed.\nIn people confined to bed, bedsores are most common over the hip, spine, lower back, tailbone, shoulder blades, elbows and heels. In people who use a wheelchair, bedsores tend to occur on the buttocks and bottoms of the feet.\nThis pressure temporarily cuts off the skin's blood supply. This injures skin cells. Unless the pressure is relieved and blood flows to the skin again, the skin soon begins to show signs of injury.\nThe pressure that causes bedsores does not have to be very intense. Normally, our skin is protected from being injured by pressure because we move frequently, even when asleep.\nWhere bedsores occur\n\nAt first, there may be only a patch of redness. If this red patch is not protected from additional pressure, the redness can form blisters or open sores (ulcers). In severe cases, damage may extend through the skin and create a deep crater that exposes muscle or bone.\nMuscle is even more prone to severe injury from pressure than skin. A bedsore can involve several layers of damaged tissue.\nAlthough pressure on the skin is the main cause of bedsores, other factors often contribute to the problem. These include:\nBedsores can lead to severe medical complications, including bone and blood infections.\n\n",
      "Symptoms of a bedsore": "Bedsores are classified into stages, depending on the severity of skin damage:\nBecause broken skin can allow bacteria to enter, bedsores are extremely vulnerable to infection. This is especially true if the sore is contaminated by urine or feces. Signs of infection in a bedsore can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing a bedsore": "A doctor or nurse can diagnose a bedsore by examining the skin. Testing is usually unnecessary unless there are symptoms of infection.\nIf a person with bedsores develops an infection, a doctor may order tests to find out if the infection has moved into the soft tissues, into bones, into the bloodstream or to another site. Tests may include blood tests, a laboratory examination of tissue or secretions from the bedsore, and an x-ray, a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI scan) or a bone scan to look for evidence of a bone infection called osteomyelitis.\nIf you care for a family member who is in a bed or wheelchair, your doctor or home care nurse can teach you how to identify the earliest signs of bedsores. You'll learn which areas of skin are particularly vulnerable and what to look for. When you find signs of skin damage, you can take steps to prevent areas of redness from becoming full-blown ulcers.\n",
      "Expected duration of a bedsore": "Many factors influence how long a bedsore lasts, including the severity of the sore and the type of treatment, as well as the person's age, overall health, nutrition and ability to move. For example, there is a good chance that a Stage II bedsore will heal within one to six weeks in a relatively healthy older person who eats well and is able to move. Stage III and Stage IV ulcers can take longer than six months to heal. Some never heal. Bedsores can be an ongoing problem in chronically ill people who have multiple risk factors, such as incontinence, the inability to move and circulatory problems.\n",
      "Preventing a bedsore": "Bedsores can still form even if a patient is receiving excellent medical care or household care — they are not necessarily a sign of neglected needs. To help prevent bedsores in a person who is confined to a bed or chair, the plan of care includes these strategies:\n",
      "Treating a bedsore": "If you care for someone with bedsores, your doctor or home care nurse may ask you to help with the treatment by following preventive steps that should stop further damage to vulnerable skin and increase the chances of healing.\nAdditional treatments, usually done by health care professionals, depend on the stage of the bedsore. First, areas of unbroken skin near the bedsore are covered with a protective film or a lubricant to protect them from injury. Next, special dressings are applied to the injured area to promote healing or to help remove small areas of dead tissue. If necessary, larger areas of dead tissue may be trimmed away surgically or dissolved with a special medication. Deep craters may need skin grafting and other forms of reconstructive surgery.\nIf the person's skin shows any signs of possible infection, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics, which may be applied as an ointment, taken as a pill or given intravenously (into a vein).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you find a suspicious area of redness or blistering on a person you are caring for, contact the person's nurse or doctor promptly.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In many cases, the outlook for bedsores is good. Simple bedside treatments can heal most stage II bedsores within a few weeks. If conservative methods fail to heal a stage III or stage IV bedsore, reconstructive surgery often can repair the damaged area.\n",

      "What is bedwetting (enuresis)?": "Bedwetting, also called nocturnal enuresis, means that a child accidentally passes urine at night during sleep. Because this is normal in infants and very young children, bedwetting is not considered a medical problem unless it happens in a child who is already in elementary school or who was completely dry day and night and then began to wet the bed again during the night.\nBy age 5, 80% to 85% of children are consistently dry throughout the night. After age 5, the number of children who continue to wet the bed decreases by about 15% per year, even without treatment. Only 1% of children still wet the bed by the time they are 15 years old.\nTo help make diagnosis and treatment easier, doctors sometimes classify bedwetting into two types, primary and secondary nocturnal enuresis. In primary nocturnal enuresis, the child has never been consistently dry at night. In secondary nocturnal enuresis, the child has been dry at night for at least three to six months (or one year, according to some experts) and has begun to wet the bed again. It is very important to remember that in both types, the child is not wetting the bed on purpose.\nPrimary Nocturnal Enuresis\nThis is the most common type of nocturnal enuresis, pediatricians think is caused by several developmental, genetic and hormonal factors acting together.\nAlthough the specific combination of factors varies from child to child, the result is the same — bedwetting. In a small number of cases, primary nocturnal enuresis arises from a purely medical problem, such as a physical defect in the child's urinary tract, a neurological problem related to the spinal nerves or brain, or a urinary tract infection.\nSecondary Nocturnal EnuresisWhen a child starts to wet the bed again after being dry for months or sometimes even years, there is often an identifiable cause. One of the most common is stress, when a sudden change rocks a child's world.\nAlmost any change in the environment — good or bad — can be a trigger; for example, a new baby, a death in the family, parents' divorce or marriage problems, a new home or school, or even a long visit from relatives. Secondary bedwetting may be related to sexual abuse or to extreme bullying. Rarely, this form of bedwetting is related to a medical problem, such as a urinary tract infection or diabetes, and in these cases there are usually other obvious symptoms of medical illness.\n",
      "Symptoms of bedwetting": "In most children with bedwetting, soaked sheets and wet pajamas are all that parents will see. In rare cases caused by a medical illness, such as urinary tract infection or diabetes, there may be other symptoms. It is especially important to watch for such symptoms in an older child who starts wetting the bed after having been dry in the past:\nTypical symptoms include frequent trips to the bathroom to urinate, excessive thirst, being tired all the time, inactivity and weight loss, even though the child may have a healthy appetite and eat a lot.\n",
      "Diagnosing bedwetting": "The doctor will ask about any family history of bedwetting. If one or both parents were affected during childhood, the doctor will want to know the age when a parent's bedwetting stopped. In many cases, a child's bedwetting will stop around the same age.\nThe doctor will ask about your child's eating and drinking habits, especially about drinking right before bedtime and eating snacks that melt into liquids, such as ice cream or gelatin desserts. In a child who has been dry in the past, your doctor will want to know about any unusual stresses, either at home or at school, that might be triggering the bedwetting.\nTo rule out medical illnesses and conditions as a cause of your child's bedwetting, the doctor will ask about additional symptoms related to a urinary tract infection or diabetes. The doctor will ask whether there is anything unusual about the way your child urinates, including straining during urination or changes in his or her urine stream.\nThe doctor will examine your child, paying special attention to your child's belly (abdomen), genital area and lower spine, looking for any physical changes in these areas. The doctor will order a test of your child's urine (urinalysis) to look for signs of a urinary tract infection or diabetes. In most cases, your doctor can make a correct diagnosis based on your child's age, the history of bedwetting, any additional symptoms, and the results of the physical examination and urine test.\nIf your child has symptoms that suggest a urinary tract infection, diabetes or other problems, additional tests may be needed. Children with primary nocturnal enuresis do not routinely need X-rays or other tests that measure bladder size, shape or function.\n",
      "Expected duration of bedwetting": "Almost all children stop wetting the bed by the time they reach their mid-teens, even without treatment. By age 15, only one out of 100 children is not completely dry at night.\n",
      "Preventing bedwetting": "To help your child achieve his or her first dry night, try these suggestions:\n",
      "Treating bedwetting": "When bedwetting is caused by a medical problem, treatment depends on the specific diagnosis.\nIf your child has no specific medical problem causing him or her to wet the bed, but has never been dry at night, there are several treatment options:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if your child starts wetting the bed after being dry for several months or if your child has symptoms of a urinary tract infection or diabetes.\nCall your doctor to discuss whether treatment would be recommended for your child who has never been dry at night and has started elementary school.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Because almost all children eventually outgrow bedwetting, the outlook is excellent, even without treatment.\nWith treatment, the success rate depends on the type of therapy. Motivational therapy succeeds in about 25% of children, behavioral therapy in about 70%, and bladder training in about 66%. The success rate of the drug, desmopressin acetate, may be as high as 70%, but varies widely in research studies.\n",

      "What is Behcet's disease?": "Behçet's (bay-setz) disease is a rare disease that causes inflammation of many parts of the body. These include the skin of the genital area, lining of the mouth, eye, nervous system, joints, and blood vessels. The most characteristic problems include ulcers in the mouth and genital areas, and serious eye inflammation. It is also called Behçet's syndrome.\nThe exact cause of the disease remains unclear. But Behçet's disease is thought to involve an autoimmune response. This means the body's defense mechanism begins to attack its own tissues. Something in the environment may trigger this abnormal immune response in susceptible individuals. Genetic factors may also play a role.\nUsually, symptoms flare up repeatedly and then improve. The time between attacks may be as short as a few days or as long as years. In some people with more severe disease, symptoms vary in intensity but are always present.\nThe first symptoms usually appear between ages 20 and 30.\n",
      "Symptoms of Behcet's disease": "Symptoms are different in each person. They range from mild to severe.\nPeople with Behçet's disease usually have painful sores in the mouth that are quite similar or identical to canker sores. But while canker sores generally occur one at a time, people with Behçet's disease tend to have multiple sores.\nMore than half of people with Behçet's disease have sores around the genitals. These sores look like the mouth sores.\nBehçet's disease can cause rashes, including acne-like bumps on the skin. It can cause inflammation around hair follicles. Blood clots can occur, usually in the legs. They can cause pain and tenderness.\nMany people with Behçet's disease have joint pain and swelling, usually in the knees, ankles, and wrists. The joints can be stiff and painful for several weeks at a time. But the disease usually does not cause long-term joint damage or deformity.\nUp to three-quarters of people with Behçet's disease have eye inflammation. Specifically, a condition called uveitis usually shows up within two years of the first symptoms. At first, uveitis can cause blurred vision. Repeated flare-ups of uveitis can lead to decreased vision or even blindness.\nIn about 10% of cases, Behçet's disease causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fever, stiff neck, headache, and uncoordinated movements.\nRarely, Behçet's disease will inflame the intestinal tract. This can cause diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, and stomach pain.\n",
      "Diagnosing Behcet's disease": "Diagnosing Behçet's disease can be difficult. The disease is rare and its symptoms can be similar to those of other diseases.\nCertain rare characteristics of this disease can be helpful in diagnosis, such as recurrent, simultaneous, and multiple oral and genital ulcers. In addition, inflammation of the lungs' arteries in Behçet's disease may cause an aneurysm. This rarely occurs in any other condition.\nSome doctors test for Behçet's disease by pricking the skin with a needle. This is called a pathergy test. After one or two days, people with Behçet's can develop a lump or nodule where the needle broke the skin.\nA skin biopsy can also support the diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed to be examined in a laboratory.\nNo tests can confirm or rule out Behçet's disease with great certainty. To diagnose the disease, doctors look for the key symptoms. These include recurring mouth sores, genital sores, skin rashes, and eye inflammation.\n",
      "Expected duration of Behcet's disease": "Behçet's disease can be a chronic (long-lasting) condition. The symptoms sometimes diminish over time and disappear for as long as several years.\n",
      "Preventing Behcet's disease": "There is no way to prevent Behçet's disease.\n",
      "Treating Behcet's disease": "Research regarding treatment of a condition as rare as Behçet's disease is difficult to perform. Large, definitive studies have not been performed. Therefore, it is uncertain which treatment options are best. In general, treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms and depends on which parts of the body the disease affects.\nSome studies suggest that immunosuppressants such as interferon (Betaseron and others), adalimumab (Humira), azathioprine (Imuran), etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept), or rituximab (Rituxan) may improve disease that has not responded to other treatments. For severe disease that affects many parts of the body, combinations of medications may be prescribed.\nVascular surgery may be necessary for aneurysms. This is particularly true if they are expanding and at risk for rupture. Blood thinners are usually recommended if blood clots complicate this disease.\nNonmedication therapy for joint pain, including exercise, is encouraged as soon as symptoms allow.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment with your doctor if you have unexplained sores in your mouth or other symptoms of Behçet's disease.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people with Behçet's disease are able to control their symptoms and live normal lives. If the first symptoms cannot be controlled with medications, more serious symptoms can appear.\n",

      "What is Bell's palsy?": "Bell's palsy is a weakness of the muscles on one side of the face caused by problems with a facial nerve. The nerve becomes inflamed and swollen and stops functioning properly.\nThere are two facial nerves, one for the right side of the face and one for the left. Each has several branches. The main branch controls most of the muscles on one side of the face, including the muscles that control facial expression and the muscles that close and open the eyes and the lips. Other smaller branches go to the tongue and ear.\n\nIn most cases, the exact cause of nerve inflammation in people with Bell's palsy is unclear. Researchers suspect the inflammation is most often triggered by a viral infection, such as herpes simplex, the same virus that causes cold sores (fever blisters). A variant of Bell's palsy, called Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, is caused by the herpes zoster virus, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles. Another cause of Bell's palsy is Lyme disease. People with diabetes are more likely to develop Bell's palsy.\n",
      "Symptoms of Bell's palsy": "Usually, symptoms of Bell's palsy begin gradually and peak in 48 hours. Early symptoms include changed sensation in a portion of the face, pain in or around the ear, increased or decreased hearing, and impaired taste. As the condition progresses, a person typically has trouble closing his or her mouth and eye on one side of the face and may complain of being unable to hold food in the mouth. The eyes also may tear more or less than usual.\n\n",
      "Diagnosing Bell's palsy": "Doctors usually can diagnose Bell's palsy based on a physical examination. Your doctor will test for weakness in the muscles of the face, paying special attention to your ability to close both eyes and hold them closed. He or she also will ask you to smile or whistle to look for a difference on the two sides of your face. Your doctor will ask whether you are having any symptoms of numbness or weakness in other body parts or difficulty walking. These symptoms are not associated with Bell's palsy, but this will help to rule out other causes of facial weakness.\nYour doctor will look for a shingles like rash on your face and ear. If you have this rash, especially if it is painful, your doctor will diagnose Ramsay-Hunt syndrome caused by reactivation of the herpes zoster virus.\nIf there are no other symptoms, and the only problem is weakness in facial muscles, your doctor can diagnose Bell's palsy without further testing. A blood sugar test may be ordered if you have not had one recently, because people with diabetes are more likely to get Bell's palsy. A blood test for Lyme disease also may be done.\n",
      "Expected duration of Bell's palsy": "Most people's symptoms peak at 48 hours, start to improve by 2 weeks, and they are back to normal by 6 months. In some cases, the symptoms do not go away completely and there is some permanent facial weakness.\n",
      "Preventing Bell's palsy": "There is no way to prevent Bell's palsy.\n",
      "Treating Bell's palsy": "If the symptoms are very mild, treatment may not be necessary. Most commonly, people with Bell's palsy are prescribed prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone and others), a corticosteroid, to reduce the inflammation and swelling in the nerve. Some doctors prescribe a combination of prednisone and an anti-herpes virus drug, such as valacyclovir (Valtrex) for 7 days.\nIf the Bell's palsy is part of the Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, treatment should always include anti-herpes drug, usually valacyclovir, along with prednisone. Bell's palsy related to Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics active against the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.\nIf Bell's palsy is affecting your ability to close your eyes, your cornea can become dry and possibly get scratched. To prevent this, you must protect your eyes from wind and dust by wearing glasses. You will need to keep your eyes moist by using artificial tears frequently during the day and lubricating your eyes at night with a sterile eye ointment.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately at the first sign of decreased strength in your face, difficulty eating or drinking, or a droopy eyelid. Also call your doctor if your ear suddenly hurts, especially if you see blisters around your ear or inside your ear canal.\nIf you have been diagnosed with Bell's palsy, call your doctor immediately if your eye starts hurting or feels irritated. Call if your arms or legs feel weak, your vision changes, you get dizzy, have trouble swallowing, or get a headache that keeps getting worse. Contact your doctor promptly if any symptoms get worse.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although the symptoms of Bell's palsy are frightening, there's a good chance that the nerve will be able to work properly again. Eighty-five percent of people with Bell's palsy recover completely within a few months. Children almost always recover completely.\nTaste returns before facial strength. If taste returns within five to seven days after symptoms began, it's more likely you will recover completely. It's also more likely you will recover completely if your facial muscles were not fully paralyzed at the most severe point of the illness.\nFactors associated with a poorer outlook include a higher degree of impairment, a longer time before symptoms start to improve, advanced age, and severe pain in or around the ear. The prognosis for Ramsay-Hunt syndrome is not as good as the prognosis for Bell's palsy.\n",

      "What is a bile duct disease?": "Your gallbladder stores bile until you eat, then releases bile into your small intestine to help digest food. Bile is made in the liver. It contains a mix of products such as bilirubin, cholesterol, and bile acids and salts. Bile ducts are drainage \"pipes\" that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine.\nA variety of diseases can affect your bile ducts. All impede the normal flow through bile ducts in some way, which is why the various diseases tend to cause similar symptoms.\nGallstones are the most common cause of blocked bile ducts. Stones typically form inside the gallbladder and can block the common bile duct, the drainpipe at the base of the liver. If the duct remains blocked, bilirubin backs up and enters the bloodstream. If bacteria accumulate above the blockage and back up into the liver, it may cause a severe infection called ascending cholangitis. If a gallstone stops in between the gallbladder and the common bile duct, an infection called cholecystitis may occur.\n\nLess common causes of blockages include cancer of the bile duct (cholangiocarcinoma) and strictures (scars that narrow the ducts after infection, surgery, or inflammation).\nOther bile duct diseases are uncommon, and include primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cholangitis (formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis). Typically diagnosed in mid-adulthood, these conditions create ongoing inflammation in the bile duct walls, which can narrow and scar the walls. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is more common in people with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease). Primary biliary cholangitis is more common in women. It is sometimes associated with autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren's syndrome, thyroiditis, scleroderma, or rheumatoid arthritis.\nBiliary atresia is a rare form of bile duct blockage that occurs in some infants two weeks to six weeks after birth, a time when the bile ducts have not completed their development normally.\nThe chronic conditions of primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and biliary atresia can result in inflammation and scarring of the liver, a condition known as cirrhosis.\n",
      "Symptoms of a bile duct disease": "Symptoms of a blocked bile duct may be abrupt and severe (for example, when a gallstone blocks the whole drainage system all at once), or they may appear slowly many years after bile duct inflammation started. Bile duct diseases often cause symptoms related to liver products backing up and leaking into the bloodstream. Other symptoms result from the bile ducts' failure to deliver certain digestive juices (bile salts) to the intestines, preventing the absorption of some fats and vitamins. Symptoms of a blocked bile duct include\n",
      "Diagnosing a bile duct disease": "Your doctor may suspect that you have a bile duct problem if you have any of the classic symptoms or if a blood test shows that you have a high level of bilirubin. Your doctor will take your medical history and examine you to look for clues that could explain damage to the bile ducts and liver. Because liver inflammation (hepatitis) and liver scarring (cirrhosis) can cause similar symptoms, your doctor will ask about your alcohol use, drug use, and sexual practices, all of which can result in liver disease.\nIf you have gallstones, have had pancreatitis or abdominal surgery, or have symptoms of an autoimmune condition (such as arthritis pain, dry mouth or eyes, skin rashes, or bloody diarrhea), tell your doctor. Because some medicines can slow drainage through the bile ducts, your medicines should be reviewed.\nYou will need blood tests to measure your levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and/or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). These are markers of bile duct obstruction. Other blood tests may suggest liver inflammation or cirrhosis. Occasionally, specialized blood tests may be helpful, such as antibody tests to diagnose primary biliary cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis. A blood test with a high level of CA 19-9 may suggest a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.\nIf your doctor suspects a bile duct problem, additional tests will depend on the suspected cause of the disease. Commonly used tests include:\nIf you have a chronic form of bile duct disease, your doctor may check you for cholesterol abnormalities or osteoporosis. Both of these conditions are more common in someone with longstanding bile duct drainage abnormalities.\n",
      "Expected duration of a bile duct disease": "To treat a gallstone blockage and infection (cholecystitis), doctors first prescribe antibiotics. After the infection subsides, a surgeon removes the gallbladder.\nSymptoms caused by a scar (stricture) may improve rapidly after treatment restores the duct's drainage.\nSymptoms of primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are long-lasting diseases. They may steadily get worse and lead to cirrhosis and liver failure after years of damage. When liver failure develops, a liver transplant can improve survival. However, primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis can return after transplant.\n",
      "Preventing a bile duct disease": "If you are overweight or have high cholesterol, you are at higher risk of developing gallstones. To avoid trouble, work toward a healthy weight through diet and exercise. Also, a near-starvation diet aimed at rapid weight loss can also result in gallstone formation.\nAlthough cholangiocarcinoma is uncommon, smoking appears to increase the risk.\nCertain parasite infections (Clonorchis sinensisandOpisthorchis viverrini, also known as Chinese liver fluke) are associated with a higher risk of bile duct diseases. If you travel to Southeast Asia, eat fish only if it is well cooked. If you do eat undercooked fish while traveling in this area, ask your doctor for a stool parasite test, especially if you have symptoms of weight loss or diarrhea.\n",
      "Treating a bile duct disease": "To treat a gallstone blockage accompanied by signs of persistent pain or infection, a gastroenterologist or surgeon can remove stones in the bile duct using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The endoscope cuts through the base of the common bile duct, allowing a stone to pass through. In some cases the endoscopist may insert various devices into the bile duct to extract the stone. This same procedure can widen an area of scarred bile duct (a stricture) by inserting and expanding a wire coil (called a stent) within the duct. Doctors generally recommend that anyone with a persistent or recurrent bile duct blockage from a gallstone have his or her gallbladder removed.\nAscending cholangitis caused by a bacterial infection requires hospitalization and intensive intravenous antibiotic therapy. If there is any blockage in the common bile duct, it needs to be cleared promptly by ERCP or other surgical procedure.\nIt's rare to find bile duct cancer early, but if it is found early, it can be treated with surgery. When cancer is more advanced, surgery cannot totally remove the tumor. Surgical procedures can help cancer patients feel better, even if they cannot provide a cure. Surgery can reroute the bile duct to allow better drainage. Radiation treatments can help to shrink, but not cure, a bile duct tumor.\nBiliary atresia, the failure to develop normal bile ducts in infants, can be treated by surgery. One method uses a portion of the baby's intestines to substitute for missing segments of the bile duct. Another method requires rerouting the bile drainage and additional intestinal surgery. However, most babies with this condition continue to have inflammation due to poor drainage, and eventually develop scarring (cirrhosis) and require a liver transplant.\nBecause both primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis can cause severe liver failure, a liver transplant may be needed for long-term survival. Treatment may reduce symptoms or delay the progression of the disease. In primary biliary cholangitis, the medicine used most often is ursodiol (Actigall).\nThe most bothersome symptom in chronic bile duct disease, itching, can be reduced with medicine — cholestyramine (Questran) or colestipol (Colestid) — that prevents irritants in the gut from being absorbed. Another medicine, naloxone, might neutralize irritants that cause itching. If greasy stools are a problem, a low-fat diet may be helpful. Doctors recommend multivitamin supplements to improve nutrition.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you develop yellowing of the skin or eyes, contact your doctor. If you also have fever or abdominal pain, call for professional advice immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Infections related to gallstone blockage have excellent results when treated. Even the most severe infection, ascending cholangitis, has a low death rate if treated promptly.\nThe prognosis for primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis has improved with better medical treatment and the potential for liver transplantation.\nThe prognosis for people with cholangiocarcinoma is better if the cancer is discovered while it is still confined to the duct. It can then be treated surgically. Once the cancer has spread, the survival rate is much lower.\n",

      "What is biliary colic?": "Biliary colic is a steady or intermittent ache in the upper abdomen, usually under the right side of the rib cage. It happens when something blocks the normal flow of bile from the gallbladder. Bile is a liquid that helps to digest fats. Under normal circumstances, bile is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. When you eat a meal, bile passes from the gallbladder through the cystic duct and the common bile duct into the small intestine, where it mixes with partially digested food.\nGallstones are the most common reason for biliary colic. If a gallstone blocks either of these ducts, the normal flow of bile into the intestine is disrupted. The muscle cells in the bile duct contract vigorously to try to move the stone, causing the pain of biliary colic. A stricture of the bile duct or a tumor also can block bile flow and cause biliary colic.\n",
      "Symptoms of biliary colic": "A person with biliary colic usually complains of an ache or a feeling of pressure in the upper abdomen. This pain can be in the center of the upper abdomen just below the breastbone, or in the upper right part of the abdomen near the gallbladder and liver. In some people, the abdominal pain spreads back toward the right shoulder blade. Many people also have nausea and vomiting.\nBecause symptoms of biliary colic usually are triggered by the digestive system's demand for bile, they are especially common after fatty meals. The symptoms also can occur when a person who has been fasting suddenly breaks the fast and eats a very large meal.\n",
      "Diagnosing biliary colic": "After you describe your symptoms, your doctor will perform a physical examination, paying particular attention to the upper right portion of your abdomen (the area of your liver and gallbladder). Ultrasound, the same painless procedure used to produce pictures of babies in the womb, can be used to produce pictures of your abdomen so your doctor can look for gallstones. Blood tests also may be done, especially if you have any fever or if your pain persists.\n",
      "Expected duration of biliary colic": "Most episodes of biliary colic pass after 1 to 5 hours. After the most intense pain passes, your abdomen may continue to ache mildly for about 24 hours.\n",
      "Preventing biliary colic": "Because biliary colic is usually related to gallstones, it can be prevented by controlling the risk factors for gallstones. Some of these risk factors, such as heredity, increasing age and pregnancy, are a normal part of life. Others, such as obesity and a high-fat diet, are risk factors you can modify through a healthy lifestyle. Women going through menopause who take estrogen (hormone replacement therapy) are also more likely to develop gallstones and biliary colic.\n",
      "Treating biliary colic": "At first, your doctor may prescribe pain medication and encourage you to eat a fat-free diet. If the first episode of biliary colic is particularly severe, or episodes of colic keep retuning, surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) usually is recommended. This procedure can be done through small incisions using an instrument called a laparoscope. The procedure usually requires only a brief stay in the hospital, and some people can leave the hospital the same day they have their operation. It is the most widely used treatment in people troubled by painful gallstones, because it is very effective and safe, with no complications in more than 90 percent of cases.\nIf surgery cannot be done and symptoms of biliary colic are lasting, medication that dissolves gallstones may be used. However, this medication is expensive and can take months or years to work. Also, only small stones will dissolve. Rarely, medication to dissolve gallstones is combined with a procedure called shock-wave lithotripsy, which uses carefully aimed shock waves to break up gallstones. However, in many people treated with medication or lithotripsy, gallstones tend to form again within a few years.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have severe abdominal pain, with or without nausea and vomiting. If you have symptoms of biliary colic and you suddenly develop a fever and shaking chills, this may signal a gallbladder infection (cholecystitis), so call your doctor immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "As long as you have gallstones that can block your cystic duct or common bile duct, you are at risk for repeated episodes of biliary colic. There is also a 25 percent chance that you will develop acute cholecystitis, or some other complication of gallstones, within 10 to 20 years.\n",

      "What is bipolar disorder?": "Bipolar disorder, which used to be called manic depressive illness or manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by wide mood swings from high (manic) to low (depressed).\nThe expert view of bipolar disorder will continue to evolve, but it is now commonly divided into two subtypes (bipolar I and bipolar II) based on the dividing line between mania and hypomania described above.Periods of high or irritable mood are called manic episodes. The person becomes very active, but in a scattered and unproductive way, sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences. Examples are spending more money than is wise or getting involved in sexual adventures that are regretted later. A person in a manic state is full of energy or very irritable, may sleep far less than normal, and may dream up grand plans that could never be carried out. The person may develop thinking that is out of step with reality — psychotic symptoms — such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations). During manic periods, a person may run into trouble with the law. If a person has milder symptoms of mania and does not have psychotic symptoms, it is called hypomania or a hypomanic episode.\nMost people who have manic episodes also experience periods of depression. In fact, there is some evidence that the depression phase is much more common than periods of mania in this illness. Bipolar depression can be much more distressing than mania and, because of the risk of suicide, is potentially more dangerous.\nA disorder that is classified separately, but is closely related to bipolar disorder, is cyclothymia. People with this disorder fluctuate between hypomania and mild or moderate depression without ever developing a full manic or depressive episode.\nSome people with bipolar disorder switch frequently or rapidly between manic and depressive symptoms, a pattern that is often called \"rapid cycling.\" If manic and depressive symptoms overlap for a period, it is called a \"mixed\" episode. During such periods, it may be difficult to tell which mood — depression or mania — is more prominent.\nPeople who have had one manic episode most likely will have others if they do not seek treatment. The illness tends to run in families. Unlike depression, in which women are more frequently diagnosed, bipolar disorder happens nearly equally in men and women.\nSince bipolar disorder can come in so many forms, it is difficult to determine its prevalence. Depending on how they define the disorder, researchers estimate that bipolar disorder occurs in up to 4% of the population. When a particularly broad definition is used, the estimate can be even higher.\nThe most important risk of this illness is the risk of suicide. People who have bipolar disorder are also more likely to struggle with alcohol use or other substance use.\n",
      "Symptoms of bipolar disorder": "During the manic phase, symptoms can include:\nDuring elated moods, a person may have delusions of grandeur, while irritable moods are often accompanied by paranoid or suspicious feelings.\nDuring a depressive period, symptoms may include:\n",
      "Diagnosing bipolar disorder": "Since there are no medical tests to establish this diagnosis, a mental health professional diagnoses bipolar disorder based on a person's history and symptoms. The diagnosis is based not just on the current symptoms, but also take into account the problems and symptoms that have occurred through a person's life.\nPeople with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when manic or hypomanic. It is important to tell your doctor about any history of manic symptoms (like those described above). If a doctor prescribes an antidepressant for a person with such a history, the antidepressant could trigger a manic episode.\nBecause medications and other illnesses can cause symptoms of mania and depression, a psychiatrist and primary care physician must sometimes work together with other mental health professionals to evaluate the problem. For example, the course of the illness can be affected by steroid treatment or a thyroid problem.\n",
      "Expected duration of bipolar disorder": "If left untreated, a first episode of mania lasts an average of two to four months and a depressive episode up to eight months or longer, but there can be many variations. If the person does not get treatment, episodes tend to become more frequent and last longer as time passes.\n",
      "Preventing bipolar disorder": "There is no way to prevent bipolar disorder, but treatment can prevent manic and depressive episodes or at least reduce their intensity or frequency. Also, if you are able to talk to your health care provider as early as you can about milder forms of the disorder, you may be able to ward off more severe forms. Unfortunately, worries about stigma often stop people from mentioning their concerns to their primary care doctor or other caregiver.\n",
      "Treating bipolar disorder": "A combination of medication and talk therapy is most helpful. Often more than one medication is needed to keep the symptoms in check.\n",
      "Mood stabilizers": "The best-known and oldest mood stabilizer is lithium carbonate, which can reduce the symptoms of mania and prevent them from returning. Although it is one of the oldest medicines used in psychiatry, and although many other drugs have been introduced in the meantime, much evidence shows that it is still the most effective of the available treatments.\nLithium also may reduce the risk of suicide.\nIf you take lithium, you have to have periodic blood tests to make sure the dose is high enough, but not too high. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea, frequent urination, tremor (shaking) and diminished mental sharpness. Lithium can cause some minor changes in tests that show how well your thyroid, kidney and heart are functioning. These changes are usually not serious, but your doctor will want to know what your blood tests show before you start taking lithium. You will have to get an electrocardiogram (EKG), thyroid and kidney function tests, and a blood test to count your white blood cells.\nFor many years, antiseizure medications (also called \"anticonvulsants\") have also been used to treat bipolar disorder. The most common in use are valproic acid (Depakote) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). A doctor may also recommend treatment with other antiseizure medications — gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax), or oxcarbazepine (Trileptal).\nSome people tolerate valproic acid better than lithium. Nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, sedation and tremor (shaking) are common when starting valproic acid, but, if these side effects occur, they tend to fade over time. The medication also can cause weight gain. Uncommon but serious side effects are damage to the liver and problems with blood platelets (platelets are necessary for the blood to clot).\nLamotrigine (Lamictal) may or may not be effective for treating a depression that is active, but some studies show that it is more effective than lithium for preventing the depression of bipolar disorder. (Lithium, however, is more effective than lamotrigine in preventing mania.) The most troubling side effect of lamotrigine is a severe rash — in rare cases, the rash can become dangerous. To minimize the risk, usually the doctor will recommend a low dose to start and increase dosages very slowly. Other common side effects include nausea and headache.\nLithium and valproic acid should be avoided during the first three months of pregnancy, because they are known to cause birth defects. In some cases, however, the return of manic or depressive symptoms could present a more significant risk to the fetus than medicines would. Therefore, it is important to discuss the various treatment options and risks with your doctor.\nFor valproic acid, lamotrigine, and other antiseizure medications, there is a small risk that suicidal thoughts or behaviors will increase. The risk is quite low. However, anyone being treated with psychotropic medications should report to their doctor immediately if new or more intense symptoms occur — symptoms of depression, changes in mood, thoughts of suicide or any self-destructive behavior.\n",
      "Antipsychotic medications": "In recent years, studies have shown that some of the newer antipsychotic medications can be effective for controlling bipolar disorder symptoms. Side effects often have to be balanced against the helpful effects of these drugs:\nSome of these new antipsychotic drugs can increase the risk of diabetes and cause problems with blood lipids. Olanzapine is associated with the greatest risk. With risperidone, quetiapine and asenapine, the risk is moderate. Ziprasidone and aripiprazole cause minimal weight change and not as much risk of diabetes.\n",
      "Antianxiety medications": "Antianxiety medications such as lorazepam (Ativan) and clonazepam (Klonopin) sometimes are used to calm the anxiety and agitation associated with a manic episode.\n",
      "Antidepressants": "The use of antidepressants in bipolar disorder is controversial. Many psychiatrists avoid prescribing antidepressants because of evidence that they may trigger a manic episode or induce a pattern of rapid cycling. Once a diagnosis of bipolar disorder is made, therefore, many psychiatrists try to treat the illness using mood stabilizers.\nSome studies, however, continue to show the value of antidepressant treatment to treat low mood, usually when a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic medication is also being prescribed.\nThere are so many different forms of bipolar disorder that it is impossible to establish one general rule. Using an antidepressant alone may be justified in some cases, especially if other treatments have not given relief. This is another area where the pros and cons of treatment should be reviewed carefully with your doctor.\n",
      "Psychotherapy": "Talk therapy (psychotherapy) is important in bipolar disorder as it provides education and support and helps a person come to terms with the illness. Therapy can help between mood episodes to help people recognize the early symptoms follow a course of treatment more closely. For depression, psychotherapy can help people develop coping strategies. Family education helps family members communicate and solve problems. When families are kept involved, patients adjust more easily, are more likely to make good decisions about their treatment and have a better quality of life. They have fewer episodes of illness, fewer days with symptoms and fewer admissions to the hospital.\nPsychotherapy helps a person deal with painful consequences, practical difficulties, losses or embarrassment stemming from manic behavior. A number of psychotherapy techniques may be helpful depending on the nature of the person's problems. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps a person recognize patterns of thinking that may keep him or her from managing the illness well. Psychodynamic, insight-oriented or interpersonal psychotherapy can help to sort out conflicts in important relationships or explore the history that has contributed to current problems.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "A manic episode is a serious problem requiring immediate treatment. However, a person in a manic episode may not be aware that he or she is sick. Some people with this illness may have to be brought to a hospital, even when they don't want to go. Many patients are grateful later when they learn that they avoided a loss or embarrassment and were pushed to get the treatment they needed.\nIf you observe manic symptoms in a person who is unaware of his or her condition, arrange a consultation with a health care provider. Treatment can prevent symptoms from accelerating, and can improve a person's progress and functioning over time.\nIf you notice worsening symptoms of depression in a person with known bipolar disorder, have a low threshold to connect them with their doctor, as they are at elevated risk of suicide.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The natural course of bipolar disorder varies. Without treatment, manic and depressive episodes tend to occur more frequently as people get older, causing increasing problems in relationships or at work. It often takes persistence to find the most helpful drug combination that has the fewest side effects. Treatment can be very effective; many of the symptoms can be diminished and in some cases eliminated. As a result, many people with bipolar disorder are able to function completely normally and have highly successful lives.\n",

      "What is a black eye?": "A black eye, sometimes called a \"shiner,\" is a bruise around the eye. When an object strikes the eye, the force of the impact breaks delicate blood vessels in the eyelids and surrounding tissues. Blood collects under the skin, and causes black or blue discoloration in the eyelids and around the eye socket. Because the skin around the eye is relatively thin and transparent compared to skin in other parts of the body, the black and blue color of a bruised eye may seem darker and more intense than bruises elsewhere.\nAlthough many people associate black eyes with fighting and violence, only about 15% of eye injuries are caused by violent assaults. Most black eyes happen by accident — during contact sports, at work, in a car crash or during home repair. Men get about four times more eye injuries than women do, and the average patient is approximately 30 years old. The source of the injury is usually a blunt object — a baseball, a hammer, a rock or a piece of lumber — and the most frequent place of injury is the home. At one time, it was also common for eye injuries to occur in motor vehicle accidents, usually when a victim's face struck the dashboard. However, the number of eye injuries caused by car crashes has decreased significantly because of airbags and the mandatory use of seat belts.\nAlmost 2.5 million traumatic eye injuries occur each year in the United States. Most black eyes are superficial injuries that don't cause any permanent damage to the eye or to the tissues around it. When vision changes after a blow to the eye, it is a warning sign that the injury may be more than a simple bruise. The force of the blow may have fractured the delicate bones that form the eye socket, or the structure of the eye itself may be damaged.\n",
      "Symptoms of a black eye": "A black eye causes swelling and black-and-blue discoloration of the eyelids and soft tissues around the eye.\nSometimes, trauma that results in a black eye also causes small areas of bleeding on the white of the eye and on the inner lining of the eyelids. If you have bright-red or dark-red discoloration of your eyeball, you have another problem. This discoloration most likely is caused by a condition called a subconjunctival hemorrhage, which means a small blood vessel in the eye breaks and bleeds. This bleeding can be caused by trauma or by retching or vomiting. Like a black eye, the color change from a subconjunctival hemorrhage typically goes away slowly on its own, and the condition does not need any treatment.\n",
      "Diagnosing a black eye": "You usually can diagnose a black eye yourself.\n",
      "Expected duration of a black eye": "Most of the swelling and discoloration go away within seven to 10 days after injury. The color of the skin around the eye will change over the course of recovery, typically showing green and yellow tones as the blood ages and is cleared from the tissue.\n",
      "Preventing a black eye": "Almost all eye injuries can be prevented. To decrease your risk of eye injuries:\n",
      "Treating a black eye": "If you have a black eye, apply cold compresses (such as an ice bag or cool, damp cloth) to the injured eye for at least 15 minutes immediately after your injury to help reduce pain, swelling and discoloration.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Most black eyes are no more dangerous than a simple bruise on your arm or leg. There are times, however, when a black eye can be a sign of a more serious problem, such as a fracture of the eye socket or an injury to the inside of the eye. Call your doctor immediately if your black eye is accompanied by any of the following symptoms:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis for an uncomplicated black eye is good as it typically heals completely within a week or two.\n",

      "What is bladder cancer?": "This type of cancer occurs in the bladder, the organ that stores urine. The bladder has an inner lining surrounded by a layer of muscle. Bladder cancer begins in the inner lining of the bladder. It is usually discovered before it has spread past this lining.\nRisk factors for bladder cancer include:\nBladder cancer tends to return in people who have had the disease.\n",
      "Symptoms of bladder cancer": "Many people with bladder cancer have no symptoms. Instead, the diagnosis is made when red blood cells are detected in a urine sample. However, people with bladder cancer often don't see blood in their urine. There is not enough blood to change the urine color. This is called microscopic hematuria.\nWhen symptoms of bladder cancer do occur, they include:\n",
      "Diagnosing bladder cancer": "Your doctor will review your medical history. He or she will ask about any history of kidney stones or urinary tract infections. These conditions can also cause blood in the urine. Your doctor will ask about your occupation and your diet.\nYour doctor will ask about your history of cigarette smoking. If you don't smoke now but did in the past, tell your doctor. Your risk of bladder cancer remains high for more than 10 years after your last cigarette.\nAfter reviewing your symptoms and risk factors, your doctor will examine you. The exam will include a rectal examination. Women will also have a pelvic examination.\nYour doctor will order laboratory tests. These will include urine and blood tests. The urine sample will be checked for the presence of red blood cells and to rule out an infection. The blood test is used primarily to make sure your kidneys are functioning normally. Your doctor may also send the urine sample to a special lab to look for cancer cells.\nIf your primary care doctor is concerned about the possibility of bladder cancer, he or she will likely refer you to a urologist for a cystoscopy. The urologist inserts a medical instrument (called a cystoscope) through your urethra into your bladder. Your urethra is the opening through which you urinate. The doctor will look inside your bladder to see if there are abnormal spots or tumors.\nIf there are areas of the bladder lining that appear abnormal, the doctor will take one or more biopsies through the cystoscope. This involves cutting out a small piece of tissue. It can then be examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If possible, the urologist will remove the entire tumor during cystoscopy.\nAdditional tests may be needed to determine if the cancer has spread.\n",
      "Expected duration of bladder cancer": "Bladder cancer will continue to grow and possibly spread until it is treated.\n",
      "Preventing bladder cancer": "To reduce your risk of bladder cancer, don't smoke. If you already smoke, ask your doctor about ways to help you quit.\nPeople who drink plenty of water every day may have a lower risk of bladder cancer.\nSome jobs increase exposure to chemicals that can cause bladder cancer. If you work with chemicals, find out what you can do to reduce your exposure.\n",
      "Treating bladder cancer": "Treatment of bladder cancer depends on:\n",
      "Tumor grade": "The tumor grade is an estimate of how likely the cancer is to grow and spread rapidly.\n",
      "Tumor stage": "The stage is determined by whether:\nTreatment options vary depending on the stage.\n",
      "Superficial tumors": "Superficial tumors are cancers that involve only the bladder lining. These tumors are usually low-grade.\nSuperficial tumors are usually treated with a procedure called a transurethral resection. In this procedure, the doctor either removes the tumor or burns it away.\nAfter transurethral resection, the doctor may place medications inside the bladder. This reduces the chance that the cancer will return. It may also prevent the cancer from progressing to a more advanced and dangerous stage.\nHigh-grade superficial tumors that return more than once or twice after treatment are more serious. Many experts recommend that people with these types of tumors have surgery to remove the bladder. This is a major operation.\n",
      "Carcinoma in situ": "Carcinoma in situ is bladder cancer within only the most superficial lining of the bladder. Carcinoma in situ can be difficult to remove completely. Transurethral resection and medical therapy sometimes eliminate carcinoma in situ. If this fails, doctors usually recommend removing the bladder.\n",
      "Tumors invading the bladder muscle": "In this case, bladder cancer has grown into the muscle of the bladder wall, but it has not spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs.\nThe standard treatment is a surgery called radical cystectomy. Radical cystectomy removes the bladder, nearby lymph nodes, and other nearby organs.\nAfter removing the bladder, the surgeon must create a different way for the body to hold and pass urine. There are several options. Each procedure has advantages and disadvantages.\nYour doctor may recommend chemotherapy before radical cystectomy. Cancer is less likely to return in some patients who receive chemotherapy before surgery. These patients may live longer.\nThe other approach is to examine the bladder after surgery to see if a patient could benefit from chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy given after surgery may not be as effective as chemotherapy before surgery.\nIn some people who have very localized, less aggressive tumors, doctors may remove only the diseased part of the bladder.\n",
      "Nonsurgical approaches": "One alternative to surgery is radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Only certain patients qualify for this approach. The advantage is the potential to keep your bladder.\nThis approach should be considered if a patient is not a good candidate for surgery.\n",
      "More extensive tumors": "Radical cystectomy is usually used to remove bladder cancer that has invaded beyond the bladder wall. If the entire tumor cannot be removed, chemotherapy or radiation therapy can shrink the tumor. It may then be removed surgically.\n",
      "Metastatic bladder cancer": "Bladder cancer that has spread to lymph nodes and/or other organs is considered metastatic. Platinum-based chemotherapy is usually the initial treatment. Patients that either don't respond or have recurrent disease may be treated with immunotherapy.\n",
      "Important follow-up": "Patients who have had bladder cancer continue to have an increased risk of developing cancers in and around the bladder. Patients should be closely monitored for the rest of their lives.\n",
      "When to call a doctor": "Call your doctor immediately if:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Your outlook depends on the stage of bladder cancer and the type of treatment used. Patients with superficial tumors have the best chance of survival. People with more invasive tumors or metastatic cancer generally have a poorer outlook.\n",

      "What is a bladder infection (cystitis)?": "A bladder infection, also called cystitis, is caused by an abnormal growth of bacteria inside the bladder, the balloon-like organ that stores urine. Bladder infections are one of the most common bacterial infections to affect humans, with up to one-third of all females having at least one infection at some point in their lives.\n\nBladder infections are classified as either simple or complicated. Simple bladder infections affect healthy men and non-pregnant women with normal urinary systems. Bladder infections occur much more commonly in women compared to men.\n",
      "Symptoms of a bladder infection": "",
      "Simple bladder infection": "Simple bladder infections in women usually are treated with one of three antibiotics: nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) twice per day for 5 days, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra, Co-trimoxazole) or fosfomycin (Monurol) as a single oral dose. Women with recurring bladder infections (more than two per year) may benefit from preventive antibiotics, either taken as a regular dose or after sexual intercourse.\n",
      "Complicated bladder infection": "Complicated bladder infections are more difficult to treat. The choice of antibiotic, the strength of the medication and the length of treatment vary depending on the circumstances. Often, antibiotics need to be taken for 7 to 10 days. Patients with severe symptoms (fever, confusion, nausea, vomiting, etc.) that suggest the bacteria have spread to the kidney or blood usually will need to be treated in a hospital.\n",
      "Diagnosing a bladder infection": "Your doctor will ask you about symptoms that are typical for bladder infection, and also ask you if you have fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, flank pain or other symptoms that may suggest a more serious infection. If you have had bladder infections before, your doctor may be able to diagnose the problem over the phone if you are not pregnant and do not have any vaginal discharge. If the symptoms are not exactly like those of prior bladder infections, you probably will need an office visit and possibly a urine analysis.\nWomen with first-time bladder infections, pregnant women, all men, children and people with any potentially complicated bladder infection will need to visit a doctor. Your doctor will examine you and request a urine sample. He or she will do a urine analysis in the office to look for signs of active infection. The urine sample also may be sent to a laboratory for culture to identify the exact type of bacteria. Usually special testing, called sensitivity testing, also is done to determine which antibiotics will effectively fight the infection. Before you provide a urine sample, you should clean your urethral opening with a sterile wipe. This sample must be collected midstream during urination to avoid contaminating the urine with bacteria that live around the urethra.\n",
      "Expected duration of a bladder infection": "Women with simple bladder infections often improve within hours of taking the first dose of antibiotic, and all symptoms should go away within three days. However, people with complicated infections, such as men with enlarged prostate glands, may have prolonged symptoms. If patients have indwelling catheters in place, it is difficult to clear the urinary system of bacteria unless the catheter is removed.\n",
      "Preventing a bladder infection": "Women may help to prevent bladder infections by wiping from front to back with toilet tissue and urinating after having sexual intercourse. Some women who have two or more bladder infections every year take an antibiotic after sexual encounters, three times per week, or daily to prevent infection. Other measures that may help to prevent bladder infections include going to the bathroom as soon as you feel the urge to urinate and drinking plenty of fluids every day. Some women who use a diaphragm for contraception have less frequent bladder infections by changing to a different method to prevent pregnancy. Some studies suggest that drinking cranberry juice may decrease your risk of acquiring a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Treating a bladder infection": "Treatment varies, depending on the type of problem.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor's office if you feel pain or discomfort when you urinate, if you need to urinate more often than usual, or if you notice that your urine smells bad or contains blood. Women in their first trimester of pregnancy will have their urine checked for bacterial growth as part of their prenatal care, even if they have no symptoms of bladder infection.\nIf you have risk factors for developing complicated bladder infections (such as indwelling catheters or underlying abnormalities of the urinary system), you should be particularly careful to watch for these signs of infection. You also should seek immediate medical attention if you develop fever, chills, confusion, nausea, vomiting, or flank pain, which may suggest that a bladder infection has spread to the kidney or blood.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Treatment with antibiotics usually cures simple bladder infections. In some cases, an untreated bladder infection may spread upward in the urinary tract to affect the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis, which is inflammation and infection of the kidney. For complicated bladder infections, the outlook depends on the clinical situation. Patients may become severely ill if the infection spreads from the urinary system to the blood, a condition called urosepsis. Intravenous antibiotics are usually effective. Usually patients diagnosed with urosepsis need a longer course of antibiotics, but this can be accomplished at home with antibiotics taken by mouth.\n",

      "What is it?": "Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelids that involves the edges of the eyelids and eyelash hair follicles. Blepharitis is a common and sometimes long-lasting condition that usual affects adults, but also can occur in children.\nPeople with skin conditions such as rosacea, seborrhea, oily skin, dandruff or dry eyes are more likely to get this condition.\nBlepharitis can be triggered by bacterial infections or by the eyelid glands making too much oil.  This condition is not contagious.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of blepharitis can include any or all of the following:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor can diagnose blepharitis based on your symptoms and an examination of your eyelids.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Blepharitis is often a chronic (long-lasting) condition. It is difficult to cure permanently. In most cases, however, the right treatment reduces the symptoms and controls the condition. In addition, symptoms can change over time and disappear for extended periods — months or years — before returning.\n",
      "Prevention": "Good eyelid hygiene can help to prevent blepharitis and usually can control the condition if you have it.\n",
      "Treatment": "\nThe key treatment for blepharitis is good eyelid hygiene. The following cleansing regimen is recommended twice daily, in the morning and the evening. Once the condition is under control, you can do this cleaning less often. However, you should resume twice-daily cleaning if the symptoms return. To clean your eyelids:\nIf the condition does not improve with cleaning alone, your doctor may prescribe antibiotic eye drops or ointment if there appears to be an infection. Drops containing an anti-inflammatory drug might also help. Create a cleaning solution by mixing three drops of baby shampoo with two or three ounces of warm water.\nMoisten a washcloth or cotton swab with the cleaning solution and rub the base of the eyelashes to remove loosened skin and crusts.\nRinse the lids with warm water and pat gently with a clean, dry towel.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you develop:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most cases of blepharitis improve promptly once the appropriate treatment is started. Often treatment must be continued for a long time or repeated from time to time. Blepharitis does not cause permanent damage to sight.\n",

      "What is a blister?": "A blister is a bubble of fluid under the skin. The clear, watery liquid inside a blister is called serum. It leaks in from neighboring tissues as a reaction to injured skin. If the blister remains unopened, serum can provide natural protection for the skin beneath it. Small blisters are called vesicles. Those larger than half an inch are called bullae. A blood blister is filled with blood, rather than serum.\n\nThere are many causes of blisters, including:\n",
      "Symptoms": "In general, blisters are round or oval bubbles of fluid under the skin that may be painful or itchy, or they may not cause any symptoms. Symptoms vary depending on the cause.\nIrritation, burns and allergies— Blisters caused by friction or burns are usually painful. Blisters resulting from eczema can be accompanied by redness, severe itching and small bumps on the affected skin.\n",
      "Diagnosing a blister": "If the cause of your blisters is not obvious, your doctor will ask about your family history and your personal medical history, including any allergies you have and any medications you take, including over-the-counter medications. You also will be asked about any recent exposure to the sun, irritating chemicals or allergens.\nYour doctor often can diagnose the cause of your blisters by their appearance and your history. If your doctor suspects an allergic reaction, he or she may recommend patch tests with chemicals to identify the allergen. Some blistering diseases are diagnosed with a skin biopsy, in which a small piece of tissue is removed and examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration of a blister": "How long blisters last depends on their cause. For example, blisters caused by irritation generally go away on their own within a few days, and those triggered by infections and skin diseases can remain for weeks or months. With an autoimmune blistering disorder, blistering may be chronic (long-lasting) and requires ongoing treatment. In skin infections, such as herpes simplex virus infection, the blisters can come back periodically. Blistering skin diseases that result from inherited causes also are long-lasting.\n",
      "Preventing a blister": "There are many simple strategies to prevent blisters caused by skin irritation. You can wear comfortable shoes that fit well, with socks that cushion the feet and absorb sweat. Apply sunscreen to protect your skin from sunburn. Be particularly vigilant about avoiding sun exposure if you are taking medications that are known to cause sun sensitivity, such as doxycycline (sold under many brand names). During cold months, use mittens, hats and heavy socks to protect your skin against freezing temperatures and chilling winds.\nAs much as possible, avoid irritants and allergens that tend to trigger eczema, such as certain hygiene products (bubble baths, feminine hygiene sprays, detergents), certain metals in jewelry, especially nickel, and irritating plants such as poison ivy.\nTo prevent blisters caused by infections, wash your hands often and never touch skin sores, cuts or any open or broken areas of skin on other people. To reduce the risk of herpes simplex, never have sex (even with a condom) with someone with active herpes. In addition, the fewer sexual partners you have, the lower your risk of herpes simplex. To avoid the spread of childhood infections, try to prevent children from sharing toys and utensils that have touched another child's mouth.\nTo prevent chickenpox and to help prevent shingles later, have your child immunized with the varicella vaccine. People who have not had chickenpox should avoid people with chickenpox or shingles until all of the blisters have crusted over. Adults can be vaccinated if they have never had chickenpox, especially if they are at risk of exposure (for example, day-care workers and teachers). Shingles vaccination is routinely recommended for adults age 50 and older.\nThere is no known way to prevent many of the blistering diseases such as the hereditary forms and the autoimmune (bullous) diseases.\n",
      "Treating a blister": "Usually, it is best to leave blisters alone. Because blisters protect the underlying skin, breaking blisters open can increase the chance of infection. Protect blisters with a bandage and cover them until they heal on their own. The liquid in the blister will be re-absorbed and the skin will flatten naturally. If a blister breaks, wash the area with soap and water, then apply a bandage. If a blister is very large or painful, your doctor may drain it and apply an antibacterial cream to prevent infection.\nThe treatment for blisters caused by eczema, infections and other diseases varies. Some cases of eczema can be treated with corticosteroid cream or pills. Herpes simplex infections and shingles (herpes zoster) sometimes are treated with antiviral medications. Antibiotic cream or pills may be given for impetigo. Chickenpox and coxsackievirus generally are left to go away on their own. The itching caused by chickenpox can be relieved with over-the-counter anti-itch lotions, such as calamine. With medication-related erythema multiforme, the medication must be discontinued immediately. Corticosteroids sometimes may be prescribed.\nPemphigoid and pemphigus are treated with corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents. Because dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with celiac sprue (a condition that develops as an immune reaction to gluten in the diet), people with dermatitis herpetiformis may benefit from a diet that does not contain any gluten (a substance found in most grains). Porphyria cutanea tarda can be treated with regular removal of blood (phlebotomy) or with medications, including hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.  Some inherited skin disorders that cause blistering may respond to measures that protect the skin from trauma.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have blisters of unknown cause, very painful blisters, or blisters accompanied by other symptoms such as fever and malaise (a generally sick feeling). Also call your doctor if a blister develops signs of infection, such as increasing redness, red streaks in nearby skin, oozing blood or pus, increased pain or swelling of the surrounding skin.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In many cases, blisters will disappear when the cause is removed or the infection has gone away, usually in a matter of days or weeks. In most herpes infections, blisters can return in the same spot (such as fever blisters on the lips or genital herpes) weeks, months or even years after the first blisters appear. Pemphigoid and pemphigus are typically chronic (long-lasting) and require long-term therapy.\n",

      "What are body lice?": "Body lice are small, parasitic insects found mainly on the clothing of infested people, and occasionally on their bodies or bedding. They spend most of their life on an infested person's clothing, crawling onto the skin to feed on the host's blood one or more times a day.\nFemale lice glue their eggs on the seams of clothing worn near the skin, where body heat allows them to hatch in about a week. Hatchlings develop to the adult stage in about nine days if they remain close to the host and have access to blood.\nMost body lice are found on people who are living in conditions that are overcrowded without easy access to bathing and regular changes of clean clothes and bed linens.\nIn certain underdeveloped and war-torn parts of the world and places with poor sanitation and overcrowding, body lice have the potential to transmit the microbes that cause trench fever, louse-borne relapsing fever and louse-borne (epidemic) typhus.\n",
      "Symptoms of body lice": "A person affected by body lice often has itching, which is an allergic reaction to their saliva. The reaction to the bites may appear as small welt-like marks and, possibly, redness and swelling, particularly around the neck and on the torso. A heavy, long-lasting infestation may produce a darkening and thickening of the skin, fatigue and other symptoms. Scratching the bites can lead to infection.\n",
      "Diagnosing body lice": "Body lice are unable to burrow into the skin. Although a few body lice may be seen clinging to body hairs, most are on the clothing of an affected person. Body lice and their eggs are most abundant along the seams of clothes worn close to the body.\nSomeone with body lice typically will have 10 or fewer active lice on their skin at any one time. But the clothing may contain many dozens or hundreds.\n",
      "Expected duration of body lice": "The presence of body lice can continue indefinitely without treatment. Body lice can be eliminated immediately by bathing and changing into clean clothing. Occasionally, treatment of the affected person's skin with an insecticide is required.\n",
      "Preventing body lice": "Body lice are spread by direct contact with affected people and their bedding or clothing. To prevent infestation, avoid sharing clothes and bedding and close, prolonged contact with an affected person. Affected people do not need to be quarantined to avoid spreading body lice. Body lice can survive for several days on clothing removed from a person.\n",
      "Treating body lice": "The person needs to be washed from head to toe. The main way to eliminate body lice is by removing and washing or throwing away infested clothing and bedding.\nBody lice and their eggs can be killed by washing clothing in very hot water, followed by drying these items in a clothes dryer set on high heat (more than 130 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 30 minutes). Dry cleaning or pressing the clothing with a hot iron will also kill the lice and eggs. Because body lice usually do not remain on the host, changing and/or washing clothes and bedding may be enough to eliminate these pests.\nPeople with a lot of body hair may need to be treated with a pesticide (pediculicide) that can be applied to the body to make sure lice are eliminated completely. Over-the-counter pediculicides containing pyrethrum extracts or permethrin can be effective. Other pediculicides containing other classes of insecticides are available by prescription.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you suspect that you have body lice, consult with your doctor or public health officials to ensure proper diagnosis and to discuss treatment options.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Once body lice are eliminated, the skin irritation and other symptoms go away quickly.\n",

      "What are boils and carbuncles?": "Boils and carbuncles are skin infections usually caused byStaphylococcus aureusbacteria (staph). These staph infections form pockets in the skin that are filled with pus, a fluid that includes bacteria, dead skin cells and infection-fighting white blood cells. Whether the pocket of pus is called a boil or a carbuncle depends on its location and size:\nAboil, also called a furuncle, begins as a painful infection of a single hair follicle. Boils can grow to be larger than a golf ball, and they commonly occur on the buttocks, face, neck, armpits and groin.\nAcarbuncleis a deeper skin infection that involves a group of infected hair follicles in one skin location. Carbuncles often are found on the back of the neck, shoulders, hips and thighs, and they are especially common in middle-aged or elderly men. People with diabetes are more likely to develop carbuncles.\n",
      "Symptoms of boils and carbuncles": "A boil looks like a red, swollen, painful bump under the skin. As the infection gets worse, a whitish tip, also called a point or head, can appear at the center of the boil. This tip is usually the area from which the boil's pus will drain. A carbuncle looks like a cluster of interconnected boils.\nWhenever you have a boil or a carbuncle, you also can have a fever and feel generally sick. A fever is more likely with a carbuncle than with a single boil.\n",
      "Diagnosing boils and carbuncles": "Your doctor can diagnose a boil or carbuncle by examining your skin. If you get several boils within a short period of time, your doctor may do blood tests to check for diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of repeated infections.\n",
      "Expected duration of boils and carbuncles": "In many otherwise healthy people, a small boil will form a white tip (come to a head) and drain within five to seven days. However, very large boils or carbuncles can last longer and may not drain on their own. These may need to be drained by a physician, and you may need to take antibiotics.\n",
      "Preventing boils and carbuncles": "If you have an area of skin that is prone to boils or carbuncles, keep the area clean and dry, and avoid wearing tight clothing that doesn't allow the skin to breathe. Washing daily with antibacterial soap also can help. At the earliest sign of irritation or a bump at a hair follicle, use warm compresses to open up the blocked pore and drain any early infection. If you develop signs of inflammation or infection at a hair follicle (folliculitis) as a result of shaving, you should avoid shaving in that area to prevent bacteria from being spread to other parts of the skin.\n",
      "Treating boils and carbuncles": "Small boils can be treated with moist heat (usually a warm, wet washcloth) applied for 20 to 30 minutes, 3 or 4 times a day. This will help the boil drain on its own. Once the boil drains, cover it with a clean bandage to protect the skin and absorb draining pus. Wash the affected area daily with antibacterial soap to prevent the infection from spreading. Anyone who helps care for the infected area should also wash his or her hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap.\nLarge boils and carbuncles may be treated with antibiotics. In many cases, the doctor will drain the infected area through a small incision. This will relieve pain, speed recovery and limit scar formation. If the infection is completely drained, antibiotics may not be necessary. If the infection is deep, your doctor may fill the empty pocket that contained the pus with a strip or piece of sterile gauze. The gauze can keep the incision open, which will allow pus to continue to drain. The pocket can then heal slowly, becoming more shallow over time until it is a superficial wound. You may need to return to the doctor a few times to have the gauze and dressing changed.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have a carbuncle, a large boil or a boil that doesn't improve after a week of warm compress treatment as described above. If you have diabetes, you should call your doctor even if you develop a small boil because you are more prone to developing serious infections. Ask to be seen immediately if a boil of any size:\nIf you have been treated with antibiotics for a boil or carbuncle and your infection does not appear to be responding within one to two days, contact your doctor again. Your infection may be caused by a type of bacteria that is resistant to several commonly used antibiotics. This bacteria is called community-acquired methicillin-resistantS. aureus(community-acquired MRSA). To treat this type of infection, your doctor needs to know that your first antibiotic was not helpful. You may need to take a different kind of antibiotic.\nIf you have had several episodes of boils within a short period of time, visit your doctor. Your doctor can check whether an undiagnosed medical illness is affecting your body's ability to fight infections.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most small boils heal without leaving a scar. In general, the larger the boil or carbuncle, the greater the chance that it will leave a scar. Because of this, you should see a doctor if you have a boil on your face. Antibiotic treatment and surgical drainage can help limit scar formation.\n",

      "What is borderline personality disorder?": "Borderline personality disorder is characterized by poor self-image, a feeling of emptiness, and great difficulty coping with being alone. People with this disorder have highly reactive and intense moods, and unstable relationships. Their behavior can be impulsive. They are also more likely than average to attempt or commit suicide. Sometimes, without intending to commit suicide, they harm themselves (for example, cutting or burning) as a form of self-punishment or to combat an empty feeling.\nWhen stressed, people with borderline personality disorder may develop psychotic-like symptoms. They experience a distortion of their perceptions or beliefs rather than a distinct break with reality. Especially in close relationships, they tend to misinterpret or amplify what other people feel about them. For example, they may assume a friend or family member is having extremely hateful feelings toward them, when the person may be only mildly annoyed or angry.\nPeople with borderline personality disorder have a deep fear of abandonment. They compete for social acceptance, are terrified of rejection and often feel lonely even in the context of an intimate relationship. Therefore, it is more difficult for them to manage the normal ups and downs of a romantic partnership. Impulsive, self-destructive behavior may be an attempt to ward off rising anxiety related to the fear of being left alone.\nThe flip side of the fear is the hope that a relationship will be completely soothing. People with this disorder may idealize a family member, romantic partner or friend, and then become enraged when an inevitable disappointment occurs. They might hold that person responsible for the pain they feel and devalue the relationship.\nMost experts believe personality disorders develop as a result of both environmental and biological factors. Early research on this disorder focused on problems in growing up, for example, having gone through abuse or neglect as a child. A significant number of people with symptoms of this disorder have reported such a history in childhood.\nLater research has suggested that people with this disorder may have inborn difficulties in regulating their anxiety or moods. They may be more vulnerable to loss or more sensitive to stress than average.\nScientists have begun to see how these characteristics are reflected in the brains of people with borderline personality disorder. Some people with this disorder have an exaggerated startle response to unpleasant stimuli. Brain regions involved in managing fear and controlling aggressive responses function differently in people with borderline personality disorder when compared to people without the disorder. Researchers have also discovered distinctive patterns in hormone levels and the immune system in people with the disorder.\nIt is quite common for people with borderline personality disorder to also have a mood disorder, eating disorder or substance abuse problem. The person may turn to alcohol or drugs to escape from painful, uncontrollable emotions.\nThree times as many women as men are diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. It occurs in about 2% of the population in the United States.\n",
      "Symptoms of borderline personality disorder": "Feeling vulnerable is a common human experience, so many people without this disorder also experience symptoms on this list. The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is made only when a person has had many of these symptoms, they are severe in degree, and they are long-lasting.\n",
      "Diagnosing borderline personality disorder": "There is no clear line between a personality style and a disorder. Personality patterns are considered to be a disorder when they impair a person's functioning and cause significant distress.\nA diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the history and observations made by a mental health professional during an interview. There are no laboratory tests to determine whether someone has borderline personality disorder. Since there is often an overlap with mood disorder or substance abuse, these diagnoses should be considered by a mental health professional in anyone who has the symptoms of borderline personality disorder.\n",
      "Expected duration of borderline personality disorder": "All personality disorders are lifelong patterns, but there is now more optimism about the more distressing aspects of borderline personality disorder. Research indicates that the symptoms of borderline personality disorder get less intense as people grow older. With proper treatment, many people see significant improvement.\n",
      "Preventing borderline personality disorder": "There is no known way to prevent borderline personality disorder. Treatment is likely to better the chances of a person with the disorder getting relief from the most painful symptoms.\n",
      "Treating borderline personality disorder": "",
      "Psychotherapy": "Psychotherapy is a key part of the treatment of borderline personality disorder.\nThe problems in this disorder are related to the person's habitual ways of relating to others and coping with obstacles. People with this disorder tend either to idealize the therapist or to become frustrated easily. They have exaggerated reactions to disappointment. Therefore, it may be difficult for them to sustain a relationship with a mental health professional. This disorder tests the skill of therapists, who have to use a combination of techniques to be effective.\nA key challenge in this disorder is that a person suffering with borderline personality disorder may understand interpersonal problems or coping strategies on an intellectual level, but still find it very difficult to tolerate the emotional discomfort that is common in relationships. Even when they do have insight, they may still have trouble managing intense emotions more successfully.\nOne popular form of structured psychotherapy is called dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). It tries to take the special problems of borderline personality disorder into account, using a combination of psychotherapy techniques, education, and both individual and group psychotherapy to support the patient's progress. A second therapy, called schema-focused therapy tries to address maladaptive points of view believed to originate in childhood and replace those \"schemas\" with a healthier one through a variety of cognitive therapy techniques.\nResearch on psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder is relatively difficult to do. Since the problems in this disorder vary widely, the researchers tend to study a few factors at a time. In some studies, DBT has reduced the frequency of self-harm and the intensity of suicidal thinking. It has also been shown to reduce the intensity of symptoms of depression or anxiety.\nStructured forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy have also been used successfully.\nIn one version, transference-focused psychotherapy, the therapist and patient look closely at the emotional themes that arise between them. People with borderline personality disorder are thought to have great difficulty understanding the difference between their own perspective and that of other people (including the therapist). In one sense, therefore, the goal of therapy is for them to gain perspective on their worldview, and to use what they learn to manage their own feelings and behaviors better. Transference-based psychotherapy has been shown to be relatively effective at reducing irritability, impulsivity and assaultiveness.\nAnother method of psychotherapy is called \"mentalization-based therapy\" (MBT). It is based on the idea that people with borderline personality disorder have difficulty \"mentalizing\" or making sense of the emotions, feelings and beliefs of themselves and others. The therapist works to help a person develop more adaptive ways of thinking about emotion and expressing it. They try to help the individual stabilize their sense of self, while managing the ups and downs in the therapy. One focus of attention is the intensity of the patient's feelings of attachment (or detachment) toward the therapist. MBT makes use of group and individual therapy and has been provided in both outpatient and hospital settings.\nWhatever label it carries, treatment aims at helping the person endure feeling isolated, depressed or anxious without resorting to self-destructive behavior or a suicide attempt. Many patients find it difficult to discuss self-destructive impulses with their health care provider, but it can help to do so. Specific plans can be made for how to manage these thoughts or impulses when they arise. Hospitalization sometimes is necessary during periods of crisis.\nOutside the hospital, a person with borderline personality disorder may need additional support, such as a day-treatment program, residential treatment, or group, couples or family therapy.\nGiven the limited amount of research in this area, and the difficulty gaining access to highly specialized treatment programs, it is often wise to employ a combination of psychotherapy techniques.\n",
      "Medication": "As with psychotherapy, there is no single medication that is clearly helpful in borderline personality disorder. Instead, medication is usually used to treat symptoms as they emerge or to treat other disorders that may be present (such as a mood or anxiety disorder or a substance abuse problem).\nThere is little evidence that antidepressants help with the core symptoms of borderline personality disorder, but they may be useful if there are clear symptoms of depression and anxiety. There is more evidence that mood stabilizers and antipsychotics improve problems with impulse control, aggression or distorted thinking. The benefits are modest and should be weighed against the adverse effects of these drugs.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Because personality styles tend to become more entrenched with age, it is best to seek treatment as soon as significant distress or poor functioning is noticed.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The course of this illness varies and depends on the severity of the symptoms; the amount of stress; the availability of support; the degree of functional impairment; the extent of self-destructive or suicidal behavior; and the presence of other psychiatric disorders, such as depression or substance abuse. It also depends on the person's ability to stay in treatment. Some people are better able to bear the challenges of treatment. Others, however, find themselves in a cycle of seeking help, then feeling rejected and rejecting the help.\nAlso, it is sometimes difficult for people with borderline personality disorder to find a therapist they feel comfortable enough with. Given the problems maintaining perspective (see above, under Treatment), it may be difficult for them to distinguish between real and exaggerated disappointment in psychotherapy. One benefit of combining individual therapy with other therapy modes (for example, group therapy) is that it can diffuse some of the intensity and refocus the person on practical goals.\nResearchers are now more optimistic about the long-term outcomes in borderline personality disorder. The vast majority of people with the disorder experience at least some reduction in symptoms with treatment. Significant numbers of patients recover from the disorder, meaning they no longer met the criteria for having borderline personality disorder and they function well. Therefore, at least with continuing treatment, it appears that many people with borderline personality disorder eventually can make significant progress, take some pleasure in their relationships and have satisfying life achievements.\n",

      "What is botulism?": "Botulism is a form of poisoning caused by exposure toClostridium botulinumbacteria. These bacteria manufacture a chemical poison known as botulinum toxin that interferes with muscle function in many areas of the body, causing paralysis of individual muscles or groups of muscles. Exposure to this toxin is life-threatening, since one of the muscles it can paralyze is the diaphragm, the muscle that controls breathing.\n\nYou can be exposed to the bacteria causing botulism in several ways, the most familiar being by eating contaminated food. In most food-borne cases of botulism in adults, home-canned foods are responsible. The bacteria that cause botulism exist in dirt and dust as a spore, but this form is inactive and does not produce toxin. However, when a spore is moved into a low-oxygen environment such as an enclosed jar or can, it can reproduce and make its dangerous toxin.\nHome-canned vegetables that are not highly acidic (asparagus, green beans, peppers, beets, and corn) are good incubators for botulism bacteria, unless they are heat-treated appropriately to kill the spores during the canning process and eaten quickly after opening. The bacteria can release large quantities of toxin into the canned food jar, causing botulism symptoms in people who sample the produce. Home-canned, smoked, or fermented fish is also a risk.\nRecent outbreaks have been reported from commercial carrot juice and home-canned bamboo shoots. In the United States, roughly 100 people become ill with botulism each year. About a quarter are due to consumption of contaminated food. Most cases today (about 70%) occur in infants. Babies less than 1 year old, especially those that are breastfeeding, have a different intestinal system than adults. Spores swallowed by an adult with a mature digestive tract usually will remain in their hibernating, inactive state. But spores ingested by a young infant can reproduce and can form toxin that is absorbed into the bloodstream, causing botulism.\nIn one out of five cases of botulism in infants, the infant has eaten raw honey. More rarely, botulism spores are found in corn syrup. Since the majority of cases of infant botulism can't be traced to a food source, experts suspect that babies are exposed simply by swallowing small amounts of dust or dirt.\nRarely, botulism is the result of a contaminated wound. Most wound botulism today occurs in people who inject or snort recreational drugs.\n",
      "Symptoms of botulism": "All of the symptoms of botulism are the result of nerve paralysis during exposure to the toxin. Symptoms usually begin within one to two days after eating contaminated food. Symptoms of infant botulism and wound botulism also appear suddenly.\nThe earliest symptoms involve the eyes and face, because nerves controlling their function are affected most quickly by the botulism toxin. Early or mild symptoms, which may go away on their own, include:\nMore severe cases can cause these additional symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosing botulism": "If your doctor suspects botulism after asking you about your medical history and examining you, both blood and stool samples may be tested to check for the presence of botulinum toxin. Generally these tests are done in a government laboratory that specializes in detecting botulism. Sometimes botulism bacteria can be grown from a stool sample.\nBotulism is uncommon enough that your doctor will consider other explanations for your symptoms. In most cases, several other tests will be ordered:\nOnce definite evidence of botulism is found with laboratory tests, usually no additional testing is needed.\n",
      "Expected duration of botulism": "Most paralysis symptoms of botulism last for several weeks and then slowly go away in the following months. Sometimes fatigue and shortness of breath can last for years.\n",
      "Preventing botulism": "You can prevent food-borne botulism with careful food-handling techniques:\nTo prevent wound botulism, do not use recreational injected drugs. Report deep wounds promptly to a physician.\n",
      "Treating botulism": "Botulism usually requires hospitalization, sometimes for a prolonged time. The main treatment for botulism is administration of an antitoxin (a chemical antidote to the toxin), and good nursing support and physician care, sometimes in an intensive care unit, with machine support by a ventilator as needed to assist breathing. If antitoxin is given early in the course of the disease, it will prevent further paralysis from the toxin, but it does not affect symptoms that are already present. Physical therapy can be helpful in aiding recovery of muscle strength.\nInfants with botulism present a special challenge: They are treated with antitoxin but are not given antibiotics because killing the botulism bacteria in their gut can cause a sudden release of more antitoxin. Instead, medicines that cause vomiting or treatments such as enemas are used to remove undigested food from the gut.\nWounds that are a source of botulism must be treated with surgery to remove contaminated tissue.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Botulism can worsen rapidly and is a life-threatening emergency. If you or your infant has symptoms of botulism and these symptoms do not have a known explanation, you should contact a physician immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although botulism can cause severe and prolonged symptoms, most people recover completely from the illness. Early treatment reduces the risk of permanent disability and death.\n",

      "What is bowel obstruction?": "In a bowel obstruction (intestinal obstruction), a blockage prevents the contents of the intestines from passing normally through the digestive tract. The problem causing the blockage can be inside or outside the intestine. Inside the intestine, a tumor or swelling can fill and block the inside passageway of the intestine. Outside the intestine, it is possible for an adjacent organ or area of tissue to pinch, compress or twist a segment of bowel.\nA bowel obstruction can occur in the small bowel (small intestine) or large bowel (large intestine or colon). Also, a bowel obstruction can be total or partial, depending on whether any intestinal contents can pass through the obstructed area.\nIn the small intestine, some common causes of bowel obstruction are:\nIn the large intestine, some common causes of bowel obstruction are:\n",
      "Symptoms of bowel obstruction": "Symptoms of small-bowel obstruction can include:\nSymptoms of large-bowel obstruction can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing bowel obstruction": "To diagnose a bowel obstruction, your doctor will need to feel and listen to your abdomen and feel inside your rectum. A blockage in the intestine is confirmed by X-rays of your abdomen, which show gas and liquid bowel contents above the area of the blockage, but no gas below the blockage. Blood tests must be done to check for dehydration or loss of electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium) if your symptoms have included vomiting.\nIf your doctor suspects you have a large-bowel obstruction, he or she may use a colonoscope, a tube that is inserted through the rectum to view the lower intestine. If the obstruction is caused by a volvulus, the passing of this instrument into the bowel not only confirms the diagnosis, but also untwists the intestine and relieves the obstruction.\nIt may not be possible to know the cause of a bowel obstruction unless surgery is done. Surgery permits a doctor to look at your intestine and at scar tissue if you have adhesions.\n",
      "Expected duration of bowel obstruction": "Symptoms of small bowel obstruction and large bowel volvulus usually become severe over a period of hours. However, large-bowel obstruction caused by colorectal cancer or diverticular disease may worsen more slowly. Some patients have mild symptoms for several weeks or months before seeing a doctor. Once the diagnosis is made, a hospital stay is required and may last for several days. With successful treatment, the obstruction is relieved.\n",
      "Preventing bowel obstruction": "You may be able to reduce your risk of some forms of bowel obstruction by modifying your diet and lifestyle. For example:\n",
      "Treating bowel obstruction": "If you have a bowel obstruction, you will be treated in a hospital. A flexible, lubricated nasogastric tube (NG tube) can be inserted through your nose into your stomach to help remove excess gas from your stomach and intestines. You will be given fluids intravenously (through a vein) because you will not be allowed to eat or drink.\nPartial small-bowel obstruction often improves within a few days, and the NG tube can be removed if one was used. At that point, you will be given sips of fluid. If you tolerate this, you will be given a full liquid diet for a day or more followed by solid foods that are easy to digest. A complete bowel obstruction often requires surgery to correct or remove the cause of the obstruction (tumor, adhesions, stricture), repair the hernia, or fix the segment of intestine at risk of repeated volvulus. During this surgery, a segment of damaged or strangulated intestine also may be removed.\nIt is sometimes most practical for your doctor and you to take a \"wait and see\" approach if you recover from one or two episodes of bowel obstruction without surgery. You may eventually require surgery to correct the cause of the blockage or to prevent future episodes, but not everyone needs surgery.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you have any symptoms of bowel obstruction.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the cause of your bowel obstruction, your age, whether you have any other illnesses (especially heart, lung or kidney problems), and the timing of your treatment. Obstruction not associated with cancer has a very good prognosis, especially in otherwise healthy people.\n",

      "What is bradycardia?": "Bradycardia is traditionally defined as a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute. A normal heartbeat is between 60 and 100 beats per minute.\nHere's what happens during a normal heartbeat: The electrical signal that starts a heartbeat comes from the heart's sinus node, the natural pacemaker located in the upper portion of the right atrium. From the sinus node, the heartbeat signal travels to the atrioventricular (A-V) node, located between the atria, and then through the bundle of His (pronounced \"hiss\") — a series of modified heart-muscle fibers located between the ventricles — to the muscles of the ventricles. This triggers a contraction of the ventricles and produces a heartbeat.\nBradycardia, even as low as 45 - 50 beats per minute, can be normal in athletes and other people who are physically active. In these people, regular exercise improves the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently, so fewer heart contractions are required to supply the body's needs.\nBradycardia can be a form of cardiac arrhythmia, a heart-rate abnormality. Cardiac arrhythmia can be caused by a problem in the sinus node, or it can be related to some disturbance in the passage of heartbeat signals through the A-V node and bundle of His. Bradycardia can occur with toxic levels of certain drugs, such as digoxin (Lanoxin) and narcotics. Also, bradycardia sometimes is a side effect of certain medications, including propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Toprol-XL), sotalol (Betapace), verapamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan) and diltiazem (Cardizem).\nBradycardia also occurs in some people who have certain medical illnesses not related to the heart, such as:\n",
      "Symptoms of bradycardia": "Bradycardia may not cause any symptoms. When it does, it can cause dizziness, weakness, lack of energy or fainting spells.\nIf bradycardia is caused by a medical illness, there will be additional symptoms that are specific to that illness. For example, people whose bradycardia is due to severe hypothyroidism also can have constipation, muscle cramps, weight gain (often despite poor appetite), very dry skin, hair that is thin and dry, an abnormal sensitivity to cold temperatures and other symptoms related to low levels of thyroid hormones.\n",
      "Diagnosing bradycardia": "Your doctor will ask about your family history of heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias and fainting spells. He or she also will review your current symptoms and your personal medical history, including your use of medications that may cause bradycardia.\nDuring the physical examination, your doctor will check your heart rate and rhythm, and your pulse. You may be asked to exercise in the office to see if your heart rate rises appropriately. Your doctor also will check for physical signs of thyroid abnormalities, including an enlarged thyroid gland, very dry skin, and hair that is thin and dry.\nTo further evaluate your bradycardia, your doctor will order an electrocardiogram (EKG). However, because some forms of bradycardia come and go, a one-time office EKG may be normal. If this is the case, a test called ambulatory electrocardiography may be done. During this test, the patient wears a portable device that monitors your heart rate and electrical pattern. You will be instructed to press a button to record your EKG reading if and when symptoms occur.\nDepending on the results of your physical examination, other tests may be necessary to check for medical illnesses that produce bradycardia. For example, if you have symptoms and physical signs of hypothyroidism, your doctor will order a blood test to measure your thyroid function.\n",
      "Expected duration of bradycardia": "How long bradycardia lasts depends on its cause. For example, normal bradycardia in a well-trained athlete will last as long as the athlete maintains his or her usual level of exercise. When bradycardia occurs as a side effect of medication, it usually will go away as soon as the drug that triggered the bradycardia is used by the body or excreted in the urine. Bradycardia caused by hypothyroidism will go away quickly after treatment with thyroid hormones. Certain forms of bradycardia resulting from cardiac arrhythmias can be cured with a permanent pacemaker.\n",
      "Preventing bradycardia": "There are no general guidelines to prevent all forms of bradycardia. When bradycardia occurs as a side effect of medication, the problem can be prevented by either switching the drug or reducing its dose.\n",
      "Treating bradycardia": "In most cases, bradycardia in healthy, well-trained athletes does not need to be treated. In fact, in most people, bradycardia does not require treatment unless patients have symptoms that are clearly due to a slow heartbeat. The following are conditions that produce bradycardia that requires treatment:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if your pulse is less than 50 beats per minute. This is especially important if you have had dizziness, weakness, lack of energy or fainting spells.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In well-trained athletes with normal bradycardia, the slow heartbeat is often a sign of overall good health. In other people with bradycardia, the outlook depends on the underlying disorder. For example, the prognosis is usually good in people with hypothyroidism, since treatment with thyroid hormones can relieve bradycardia and other symptoms related to low hormone levels. In some elderly patients, hormone dosages may need to be increased very slowly over several weeks to prevent straining the heart. The availability of permanent pacemakers has improved the quality of life and prognosis for many people with cardiac arrhythmias.\n",

      "What is a brain abscess?": "A brain abscess is a collection of pus enclosed in the brain tissue, caused by a bacterial or fungal infection. A brain abscess can develop as a complication of an infection, trauma or surgery. They are rare, although people with weakened immune systems (such as people with HIV or those who have received an organ transplant) are more likely to get a brain abscess.\nThis type of infection usually begins in one of these ways:\n",
      "Symptoms of a brain abscess": "Symptoms vary depending on the size and location of the abscess. More than 75% of people with a brain abscess have a dull, achy headache. For many people this is the only symptom. The pain usually is limited to the side of the brain where the abscess is, and the pain usually becomes worse until the abscess is treated. Aspirin and other pain medication do not relieve the pain.\nAbout half of the people with a brain abscess have a low-grade fever. Other symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness, seizures, personality changes and muscular weakness on one side of the body.\n",
      "Diagnosing a brain abscess": "Diagnosing a brain abscess is not easy because the early symptoms are so general. For example, many things can cause headaches. For this reason, the diagnosis of brain abscess is usually delayed until about two weeks after symptoms first develop. In some cases, people with brain abscesses develop seizures or neurological changes, such as muscle weakness on one side of the body, before the diagnosis is made.\nIf your doctor is concerned you have a brain abscess, he or she will ask about your medical and travel history to determine your risk of having certain infections. The doctor also will ask if you have any of the symptoms of brain abscess. If you do, he or she will ask when they started, how they've progressed, and whether you've had a recent infection or any trauma that could predispose you to a brain abscess.\nTo diagnose a brain abscess, you will need diagnostic tests, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. These provide pictures of the inside of the brain. The abscess will appear as one or more spots. Blood and other body fluids may be studied to find the original source of the infection. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, a neurosurgeon can remove a piece of the brain abscess with a fine needle.\n",
      "Expected duration of a brain abscess": "A brain abscess can grow very quickly, typically becoming fully formed within about two weeks. Your doctor will begin treatment immediately after you are diagnosed. Prompt medical attention is the key to relieving your symptoms more quickly and minimizing damage to your long-term health. Surgical drainage of the abscess is often necessary as well.\n",
      "Preventing a brain abscess": "Some brain abscesses are related to poor dental hygiene or complex sinus infections.  You should floss daily, brush your teeth properly and visit your dentist regularly. Treat sinus infections with decongestants. If symptoms of a sinus or dental infection persist, you may need an antibiotic.\nPeople with untreated HIV infection are at increased risk of brain abscess. Prevent HIV by practicing safe sex. If you have HIV, you substantially reduce your chance of developing a brain abscess by taking anti-viral medications regularly.\n",
      "Treating a brain abscess": "Treatment of a brain abscess typically requires a two-pronged approach:\nTo confirm that the treatment was successful, you will be monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans to view the brain and abscess. If seizures are a problem you may need anticonvulsant medications, which may continue even after the abscess has been successfully treated.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you experience a nearly constant headache that gets worse over several days or weeks. If you also have nausea, vomiting, seizures, personality changes or muscle weakness, seek emergency care.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Without treatment, a brain abscess can be fatal. Most people with a brain abscess are treated successfully. Unfortunately, long-term neurological problems are common even after the abscess is removed and the infection is treated. For example, there may be lingering problems with body function, personality changes or seizures due to scarring or other damage to the brain.\n",

      "What is a brain tumor?": "A brain tumor is a mass of abnormally growing cells in the brain or skull. It can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Unlike other cancers, a cancer arising from brain tissue (a primary brain cancer) rarely spreads. Whether benign or malignant, all brain tumors are serious. A growing tumor eventually will compress and damage other structures in the brain.\n\nThere are two categories of brain tumors: primary and secondary. Primary tumors start in brain tissue, while secondary tumors spread to the brain from another area of the body. Primary tumors are classified by the tissue in which they begin:\nSecondary tumors most commonly arise from the lungs or breast. Other cancers, especially melanoma (a type of skin cancer), renal cell cancer (a type of kidney cancer), and lymphoma (a cancer of the immune system) can spread to the brain. When this happens, the cancer is the same as the original cancer. For example, lung cancer that spreads to the brain is known as metastatic lung cancer, because the tumor's cells resemble abnormal lung cells. Secondary brain tumors are much more common than primary tumors.\nAlthough brain tumors can occur at any age, they most commonly affect adults 40 to 70 years old and children 3 to 12 years of age. Whether the use of cellular phones contributes to the development of brain tumors, especially in children, has sparked debate. The issue is far from resolved, and additional research is needed.\n",
      "Symptoms of a brain tumor": "The symptoms of a brain tumor often are the same as those of other diseases and may develop gradually. That's why they may be overlooked for a long time before diagnosis.\nAlthough a brain tumor rarely causes headaches, someone with no history of headaches who develops them should be seen by a doctor. Headaches from a brain tumor tend to be worse upon waking and ease during the day. Other symptoms may include\nThe symptoms noted above are not specific for brain tumor. In fact, most often any of these symptoms are related to some other cause.\nThe specific symptoms of a brain tumor depend on its size and location. They can be caused by several factors, including:\n",
      "Diagnosing a brain tumor": "Diagnosis often begins with a medical history. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, health habits, and past illnesses and treatments. He or she will also do a neurological exam to check your\nYour doctor may also order one of these imaging tests:\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan.For this test, radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. A rotating scanner highlights areas where cells are consuming lots of glucose. (Cancer cells use more glucose than normal cells.)\nIf a brain tumor is suspected to be a secondary cancer, imaging tests also may be done of other organs.\nYour doctor may also want to do a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). During this test, spinal fluid is taken from the lower back with a needle. The fluid can be checked for signs of infection or cancer cells.\nIn rare cases, doctors may want to remove a small piece of tumor tissue before diagnosing the cancer. This is called a biopsy.\n",
      "Expected duration of a brain tumor": "Meningiomas can remain the same size for many years without causing problems. Other types of brain tumors will continue growing until they are treated. Without treatment, permanent brain damage or death can result. Many brain tumors can lead to death even with the best treatment.\n",
      "Preventing a brain tumor": "There is no known way to prevent primary brain tumors. As more is learned about what causes them, more may be done to prevent them. Researchers are studying genetic and hereditary factors, exposure to certain chemicals, and exposure to certain viruses.\nSome secondary brain tumors that originally started in other organs can be prevented. For example, avoiding tobacco products decreases the risk of lung cancer, thereby decreasing the chance that lung cancer cells ever appear in the brain.\n",
      "Treating a brain tumor": "Treatment depends on the tumor's size, location, and type, as well as the patient's age and general health. The main treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A combination of treatments — surgery and radiation therapy, for example — is often used. Before treatment, a patient may be given corticosteroid drugs to reduce swelling of brain tissue. Anticonvulsant drugs also may be prescribed to prevent or control tumor-related seizures.\nWhen possible, surgery is the treatment of choice for primary brain tumors. Surgery can successfully remove some benign and malignant brain tumors. Even if the entire tumor cannot be removed, surgeons will likely take out as much as possible to help relieve symptoms.\nIn some cases, a tumor cannot be removed surgically or surgery is too risky. For example, the tumor may abut or wrap around critical normal tissues. Damage to these tissues during surgery could cause the patient significant disability.\nStereotactic surgery, which uses computers and imaging devices to create three-dimensional pictures of the brain, can be used to remove tumors or to place radioactive materials in the tumor. Stereotactic surgery is especially helpful in reaching tumors deep in the brain. It can help pinpoint the tumor's edges, too, meaning that surgeons remove less normal tissue. This lowers the chances of side effects and brain injury.\nRadiation therapy, which uses high-powered x-rays to kill cancer cells, often follows surgery. It helps destroy any pieces of the tumor that could not be surgically removed and any remaining cancer cells. Radiation therapy is also used when surgery is not an option.\nBecause high-dose radiation can damage normal tissue, doctors try to precisely target the tumor, limiting the amount of radiation to surrounding parts of the brain. Gamma Knife and CyberKnife are examples of treatments that allow doctors to more precisely aim the radiation beam at the tumor and better spare surrounding normal tissue. Radiation also can be given by putting radioactive material into the tumor itself.\nChemotherapy uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells. It can be taken by mouth, injected into a vein or muscle, or placed directly into a body part. In general, chemotherapy tends to be less effective against gliomas and meningiomas than surgery or radiation. But it plays an important role in the treatment of other types of brain tumors, such as lymphomas and medulloblastomas.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor right away if you have\nCall your doctor if you have unexplained weakness or memory or personality changes.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Early detection and treatment offer the best chance of recovery from both benign and malignant brain tumors. The outlook also depends on\nIn general, lower-grade tumors have a better prognosis.\n",

      "What is breast cancer?": "Breast cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that can develop in one of several areas of the breast, including:\nBreast cancer is considered invasive when the cancer cells have penetrated the lining of the ducts or lobules. That means the cancer cells can be found in the surrounding tissues, such as fatty and connective tissues or the skin. Noninvasive breast cancer (in situ) occurs when cancer cells fill the ducts or lobules but haven't spread into surrounding tissue.\nThese are the main forms of invasive breast cancer:\nAs more women have regular mammograms, doctors are detecting many noninvasive or precancerous conditions before they become cancer. These conditions include:\nA woman's risk of developing breast cancer increases with age; more than three out of four breast cancer cases occur in women over age 50. Other risk factors for breast cancer include:\nAlthough breast cancer is about 100 times more common in women than in men, men can develop the disease.\n",
      "Symptoms of breast cancer": "Symptoms of breast cancer include:\n",
      "Diagnosing breast cancer": "Your doctor will ask whether you have any risk factors for breast cancer, especially whether the disease runs in your family. He or she will then examine your breasts, looking for any signs and symptoms of breast cancer. These include a lump or thickening in your breast, nipple inversion or discharge, swelling or changes in breast contour, redness or dimpling of breast skin, and enlarged lymph nodes under your arm.\nIf your doctor discovers a lump or your screening mammogram detects an area of abnormal breast tissue, your doctor recommend additional tests for breast cancer. If you haven't yet had a mammogram, that may be the next step. But in other cases, the next step is an ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nUltrasound can confirm whether the lump is a solid tumor or a fluid-filled, noncancerous cyst. It can also be used to assess any abnormal areas found on a mammogram.\nAlthough it is not routinely performed, MRI is used to assess abnormalities on a mammogram, get a more accurate estimate of a cancer's size, and check for other cancers. MRI can also be used for screening in woman at high risk of breast cancer. Examples include:\nIf the lump is solid, your doctor probably will recommend a breast biopsy. During a biopsy, a small amount of breast tissue is removed and analyzed in a laboratory. Sometimes, your doctor will recommend a biopsy without doing an ultrasound or MRI first.\nA breast biopsy can be done in different ways. These include:\nThe type of biopsy your doctor chooses will depend on the location of the lump, its size, and other factors.\nA specialist called a pathologist will examine the tissue under a microscope determine whether the tissue contains cancer cells. If it does, the pathologist can determine the type of breast cancer.\nThe pathologist will also assign a grade to the cancer. The grade indicates how closely the cancer cells resemble normal cells. A lower grade means that the cancer is slower-growing and less likely to spread; a higher grade means that the cancer is aggressive and likely to spread. The grade is one factor doctors consider when planning treatment. The pathologist may also determine how rapidly the cancer cells are dividing.\nDepending on the type of biopsy and whether neighboring lymph nodes were removed, the biopsy report may include additional information. For example, the report may clarify how much the cancer has spread.\nAnother important step is to determine whether the cancer cells are hormone-receptor positive for estrogen and progesterone. Receptors allow specific substances, such as hormones, to latch on to the cell. Normal breast cells have both estrogen and progesterone receptors.\nCancer cells may have both receptors, one receptor, or no receptors. Women who have hormone-receptor positive cancers generally have a better prognosis. That's because they are more likely to respond to hormone therapy.\nThe biopsy sample should also be tested for a growth-promoting protein called HER2. The HER2 gene tells the cell to make the HER2 protein. Cancers with multiple copies of the HER2 gene produce too much HER2. These cancers, called HER2-positive, tend to grow and spread quickly.\nThis kind of information helps to guide treatment decisions. For example, women with HER2-positive cancers are likely to benefit from drugs that target the HER2 protein.\nYou may need to have additional tests to determine whether the cancer has spread. These include:\n",
      "Expected duration of breast cancer": "Breast cancer will continue to grow and spread until it is treated.\n",
      "Preventing breast cancer": "Although there are no guarantees, you can take steps to help prevent breast cancer:\nSome women inherit mutations in the so-called breast cancer genes — BRCA1 and BRCA2. These genetic mutations put them at very high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. These women require more frequent screening, often with MRI. Some women opt to have their breasts and ovaries removed. This is the best way to prevent breast and ovarian cancer.\n",
      "Treating breast cancer": "Treatment for breast cancer usually begins with a decision about the type of surgery. Factors taken into consideration include:\nA mastectomy removes the entire breast, usually with removal of some of the lymph nodes located in the axilla (armpit). A lumpectomy removes only the cancerous tumor and a small amount of healthy tissue around it.\nThe cancerous breast tissue removed during surgery may undergo further analysis. This can include looking for certain molecular and genetic characteristics that sometimes influence decisions regarding additional therapy. In addition, the results may provide information relevant to cancer risk in family members.\nAfter surgery, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of therapies. Additional therapies decrease the risk of cancer returning or spreading. Radiation therapy usually is recommended after a lumpectomy to destroy any cancer cells left behind and to prevent the cancer from returning.\nThe need for chemotherapy depends on how much the cancer has spread and the molecular characteristics of the cancer. In some cases, chemotherapy is recommended before surgery to shrink a large tumor so that it can be removed more easily. Chemotherapy is usually necessary if cancer returns.\nHormone therapy usually is recommended if the cancer is estrogen-receptor positive. The drug most often used in these cases is tamoxifen. It locks estrogen out of breast cancer cells that are estrogen-receptor positive. (Estrogen can help cancer cells grow.) This may reduce the chances that the cancer will return by up to 30%.\nAromatase inhibitors are another form of hormone therapy. These drugs decrease the amount of estrogen in the body by blocking estrogen production in all other tissues except the ovaries. Aromatase inhibitors are most useful in menopausal women, because the ovaries stop making estrogen after menopause.\nDrugs that target specific genetic changes to attack cancer cells are called targeted therapies. For example, if you breast cancer is HER2-positive, your doctor may offer you trastuzumab (Herceptin). This drug is a manmade version of an immune system protein. It attaches itself to the HER2 receptor, slowing the growth of cancer. It may also stimulate your immune system to mount a stronger attack.\nTreatment for DCIS is based on multiple characteristics of the cancer, including the tumor size, margin width, histological features seen under the microscope, tumor markers, and patient's age. The recommended treatment could be breast-conserving surgery alone, lumpectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, or mastectomy. In cases where DCIS occurs in more than one location or if the tumor cells look especially worrisome on biopsy, the doctor may recommend mastectomy. Lymph nodes might also be removed as part of the mastectomy.\nIn most cases, LCIS has a lower likelihood of progressing to invasive cancer, so little or no treatment is required. However, women with this condition are more likely to develop cancer in other areas of the same breast or in the other breast, so they should have regular mammograms and breast exams. To decrease breast cancer risk, some women use hormone therapy, such as tamoxifen.\nBased on your genetic markers, your doctor can choose the drugs that are most likely to attack your cancer. He or she may look to genetic markers to determine the chances that your breast cancer will spread to another site.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you feel a lump or abnormal thickening in your breast. Call your doctor if you notice:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Early diagnosis significantly improves the outlook for women with breast cancer. If the tumor is small and confined to the breast, more than 90% of women survive five years or longer. However, if the disease spreads throughout the body before diagnosis, that rate drops to less than 20%.\nCancer in one breast puts you at higher than average risk of developing cancer in the other breast. This is true even if you are still being treated with an estrogen blocker. Be sure to have regular checkups and mammograms.\n",

      "What is a broken jaw?": "When a bone breaks or cracks, the injury is called a fracture. Jaw fractures are the third most common type of facial fractures, after fractures of the nose and cheekbone. They can be caused by many different types of impacts to the lower face, including:\nThe jaw bone is also called the mandible. It is a long bone that includes your chin and angles up toward your ear on both sides of your face. On each side, the end of the jawbone is rounded like a ball. This \"ball,\" called the condyle, is the part of the jaw joint right in front of your ear. It lets you open and close your mouth. The jaw joint is also called the temporomandibular joint or TMJ.\nA fracture can happen anywhere along the jawbone. In more than 50% of cases, the jaw fractures in at least two places — a direct fracture where the jaw was hit and an indirect fracture somewhere else along the jaw. Most often, this second fracture is near one of the ends of the mandible, close to the jaw joint. The second fracture occurs when the force of impact travels upward along the jaw and snaps the relatively thin part of the jawbone just below the ear.\nFractures of the condyles are the most common type of jaw fracture in children. They usually happen when a child falls and strikes his or her chin against the ground or some other hard surface. In teenagers and young adults, jaw fractures more commonly occur on the side of the face nearer the chin because this area is often struck during fights or attacks.\nAn impact with a dashboard during a car accident can fracture any part of the jaw, including the condyles. The force of the impact can dislodge teeth, and cause fragments of the broken jaw to pierce the gum or damage nearby blood vessels and nerves.\n",
      "Symptoms of a broken jaw": "Symptoms of a broken jaw can include:\nWhen a young child falls on his or her jaw, a deep cut may occur along with a fractured jaw. Parents or other adults may focus on stopping the bleeding and not consider signs of a jaw fracture. If the child is too young to describe some symptoms, the jaw fracture may not be discovered until the child is older and complains of bite problems (malocclusion).\n",
      "Diagnosing a broken jaw": "Your doctor will review your symptoms and ask you how you injured your jaw. Your doctor also will ask if you have broken or severely injured your jaw before, and whether your bite felt normal before you injured your jaw.\nNext, your doctor will examine the entire length of your jaw, looking at its shape, whether both sides look the same, how it is aligned with the rest of your face, and any obvious areas of swelling, cuts, bruising, deformity, or tenderness. Your doctor also will check for tenderness inside your ear canal (a sign that your jaw joint may be injured) and for numbness in your lower lip and chin. Next, your doctor will ask you to open your mouth to see whether your jaw joint opens normally and evenly. While your mouth is open, the doctor will check for broken and loose teeth, obvious abnormalities in the alignment of your teeth, and areas of swelling or bruising along your gums.\nTo make sure that a broken jaw is the problem, your doctor will either order standard x-rays of your jaw or a special dental panoramic x-ray (Panorex). For some fractures near the jaw joint, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be necessary.\n",
      "Expected duration of a broken jaw": "Once an uncomplicated jaw fracture is treated, healing usually takes one to two months.\n",
      "Preventing a broken jaw": "You can help to prevent jaw fractures by avoiding trauma to your chin and lower face. To do this, you should:\n",
      "Treating a broken jaw": "Your doctor will treat your fractured jaw by either realigning the fractured pieces of bone with wires or by repairing the break with metal plates and fine screws. If fragments of bone have pierced the skin or if teeth were lost or loosened, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic, usually penicillin or clindamycin (Cleocin), to reduce the risk of infection.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor or dentist immediately if you suffer a blow to your jaw, and you have any of the following symptoms:\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, the outlook is very good, especially when the fracture is treated promptly and properly. In rare cases, when the fracture is ignored or healing is poor, long-term complications can include facial deformity, long-lasting facial pain, pain or limitation of movement at the jaw joint, and a bad bite.\n",

      "What is a broken nose (nasal fracture)?": "A broken nose is a fracture (crack or break) of the nasal bones. In most cases, there is also some damage to nearby nasal cartilage, particularly the nasal septum, the flexible partition that divides the left and right sides of the nose.\nBecause the nose has such a prominent and unprotected position in the center of the face, it is particularly vulnerable to impacts from accidents and violence. In mild fractures, the injury causes only some mild swelling and a brief nosebleed, so you may be unaware of the break unless your nose heals with a slight deformity.\nIn severe fractures, however, the nose can be obviously deformed or shifted out of its normal midline position immediately after impact. There also may be a severe nosebleed, a blocked nostril or air-flow problems related to a deviated septum (a shift of the nasal septum toward the left or right nostril).\nHealth care professionals do not know how often people break their noses, because many people who have mild nasal fractures do not seek treatment. Among adults and teenagers treated by doctors, the most common causes of nasal fractures include contact sports, car crashes, motorcycle accidents and violent assaults. In particular, athletes are at high risk of a broken nose if they participate in soccer, basketball, baseball, boxing, martial arts (especially kickboxing), wrestling, handball, racquetball or mountain biking.\nAlthough the nose is also an easy target for fractures during hockey and football games, helmets used in these sports provide some protection against facial injuries. Protective helmets also may reduce the risk of broken noses (as well as more severe injuries) in people who ride motorcycles or bicycles.\nThe increased use of seat belts and airbags over the past three decades has dramatically reduced the number of people who break their noses by hitting the dashboard during a car crash.\nIn infants, the bones in the nose sometimes are fractured at the time of delivery. In older children, broken noses often are caused by a fall, a bicycle accident, contact sports or child abuse.\nIn general, children tend to be at lower risk of a broken nose than adults because a child's immature bones are generally less brittle and more flexible. However, a broken nose in a child is more likely to cause long-term deformities or breathing problems because a child's nasal bones and cartilage have not finished growing.\n",
      "Symptoms of a broken nose": "Symptoms of a broken nose include:\nEven if your nose is injured only mildly, the area can swell significantly within one to two hours after the impact. Until this swelling goes away, you or your doctor may not be able to accurately assess the extent of any damage.\n",
      "Diagnosing a broken nose": "After reviewing your symptoms, your doctor will ask how you injured your nose, whether you have broken or severely injured your nose before, and whether you have ever had nasal surgery.\nNext, your doctor will examine your nose, looking at its shape and symmetry, the alignment of its bones, the position of the nasal septum and any obvious areas of deformity or tenderness. Using a bright light and an instrument (nasal speculum) that gently spreads open your nostril, your doctor will inspect the inside surface of each nostril and check your nasal septum for a bruise or blood clot. In many cases, no other tests are needed. X-rays are not always necessary.\nYour doctor may refer you to an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist) or a plastic surgeon if your nose is deformed, the air flow through your nose is obstructed, or you have other symptoms that require specialized care. These doctors may order additional testing before treating your nasal fracture.\n",
      "Expected duration of a broken nose": "Although tenderness and swelling usually subside within one to two weeks, any deformities of the nasal bones or cartilages are permanent unless they are treated by a specialist.\n",
      "Preventing a broken nose": "You can help to prevent a broken nose by avoiding trauma to your nose. Wear a seat belt and a shoulder harness whenever you ride in a car and wear headgear to protect your face during contact sports. Wear a protective helmet if you ride a motorcycle or bicycle.\n",
      "Treating a broken nose": "If your injured nose is deformed or misaligned and you seek emergency treatment, the doctor may attempt to realign your nose immediately. This can be done with or without surgery. For persistent bleeding, the doctor may pack the front of your nose with a hemostatic sponge or gauze. If there is a bruise or blood clot on your nasal septum (a septal hematoma), the doctor will make a small incision to allow the blood clot to drain. A septal hematoma that is not drained can lead to permanent deformity of the nose.\nIf your injury seems to be less severe, your doctor may wait for a few days to allow swelling to subside before assessing the situation. In many cases, the nose can be realigned within the first 10 days after injury in a nonsurgical procedure called a closed reduction. After that time, the realignment can be done surgically with a procedure called a rhinoplasty, which reshapes your nose to improve its appearance. When the nasal septum needs to be repaired as well, the procedure is called a septorhinoplasty.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you suffer a blow to the nose and you have any of the following symptoms:\nIf you suffer a less severe blow to your nose, the initial swelling of the injury may make it difficult to see a mild nasal deformity or a deviated septum. To be sure that you have not missed a fracture, wait a few days for the swelling to subside and then check your nose in the mirror. Contact your doctor if you find that your nose is deformed, is shifted out of its normal midline position or has a deviated septum.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, the outlook is good, even when surgical treatment is necessary to realign or reconstruct the nose. A small number of people choose to have reconstructive surgery more than once, either for cosmetic reasons or to improve air flow.\n",

      "What is bulimia?": "The main characteristics of the eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, are\nDuring a binge, a person eats large quantities of food in a relatively short time, regardless of hunger. Binge eating is defined only in part by food quantity. A more important feature is the person's state of mind: During a binge, the person with bulimia feels out of control of the eating and cannot stop it.\nPeople with bulimia may try to control weight in a variety of ways. One strategy is purging (self-induced vomiting immediately after a binge). Another strategy is abuse of laxatives, suppositories, enemas, or diuretics. Alternatively, a person may go on an extended fast or start a period of strenuous exercise.\nThere is significant overlap between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa, since those with bulimia may restrict food intake (a characteristic of anorexia) and people with anorexia may binge and purge. In both disorders, a person may be preoccupied with weight and be very self-conscious about body size and shape.\nWhen binge-eating occurs without the compensatory behaviors that are aimed at controlling weight, it is called binge-eating disorder.\nThe overwhelming majority of people with bulimia are female (85% to 90%) and the disorder usually begins between ages 15 and 20. The condition affects up to 4% of women at some point in life. When men have the disorder, it is usually the nonpurging type.\nPeople with bulimia can eat huge quantities of food, sometimes up to 20,000 calories at a time. Binge foods tend to be comfort foods that are sweet, salty, soft or smooth, and generally high in calories. Examples are ice cream, cake, and pastries.\nPeople with bulimia may binge a few times a week or as frequently as several times a day. Although people with bulimia fear becoming fat, and some are severely underweight or overweight, most are of normal weight or only slightly overweight.\nLike anorexia, bulimia is unhealthy for the body. Purging can cause dehydration. The strong acids in stomach contents eat away at the layer of protective tooth enamel, making teeth much more vulnerable to decay. Laxative use can cause chronic gastrointestinal problems. At its most destructive, bulimic behavior can lead to problems with heart function. Rarely, it can cause death.\nPeople with bulimia often feel ashamed of their binging and purging behaviors, so they may act secretly. They often have other problems with impulse control (such as addictions) and other mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, panic, or social phobia.\nThe specific biological cause for bulimia nervosa is not known, but it is presumed to have a genetic (inherited) component. The disorder does run in families. Most experts believe that, in bulimia, the brain areas that regulate appetite do not function properly.\n",
      "Symptoms of bulimia": "Symptoms of bulimia include:\nBulimia can lead to:\n",
      "Diagnosing bulimia": "The central characteristics of bulimia nervosa are binge eating and a preoccupation with weight or body image. Severe eating binges occur regularly, along with a sense of loss of control. The person performs compensating behavior such as purging, exercise, or excessive dieting. See a doctor if you feel worried about such thoughts and behaviors connected to food and weight.\nYour doctor will ask you about your medical history and do a physical examination to check your general health. She or he may also order blood tests to check for problems associated with vomiting or laxative use.\nYour doctor will also explore whether you have any other areas of mental distress, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, an anxiety or mood disorder, or problems with substance use.\n",
      "Expected duration of bulimia": "Bulimia can last for a short time, for example during a period of stress or a life transition, or it can continue for many years. About 25% of individuals with bulimia get better without treatment. With treatment, more than half improve.\nBut even after successful treatment, bulimia can return, which is why experts often recommend maintenance treatment. Estimates of frequency and severity vary widely.\n",
      "Preventing bulimia": "There is no known way to prevent bulimia. Treatment can be easier if the problem is detected early.\n",
      "Treating bulimia": "An eating disorder is a complex mix of physical and emotional problems. Therefore, health care providers try to organize a treatment that can address these problems comprehensively.\nThe goals of treatment are to:\nTreatment includes nutritional counseling, psychological counseling or therapy, and medication such as antidepressants. It is often most helpful to combine a few of these approaches. As long as there is no acute medical danger, the person with bulimia should be encouraged to establish personal goals.\nNutritional counseling usually involves developing a structured meal plan and learning to recognize body cues and urges to binge and purge. A significant number of people with bulimia nervosa see improvements with relatively simple interventions, like being taught about the illness or using guided self-help programs.\nCognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the best-studied approach, and it has proven to be effective. In general, psychotherapy aims to help people with bulimia improve their body image, understand and deal with their emotions, modify their obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviors related to food, and gain healthy eating behaviors.\nTo address the behavior, a CBT therapist may first teach about the illness itself, help plan regular meals, encourage monitoring of urges, and suggest ways to cope with them. On the cognitive side, the therapist will help the patient to understand stresses that trigger unhealthy eating, and to modify attitudes and beliefs that contribute to the binge-and-purge cycle.\nFamily and group psychotherapy can be helpful, too. In practice, therapists tend to combine elements of CBT with other forms of therapy (for example, family counseling or therapy, interpersonal therapy, and/or psychodynamic therapy) depending on the person's needs. Self-help groups and homework guided by a professional can also be good supplements to a treatment plan.\nMedication can reduce the urge to binge and purge, particularly in the short term. But most patients are not able to manage an ongoing problem with medication alone. Therefore most experts recommend combining medication with psychotherapy or other kinds of support.\nFluoxetine (Prozac) has been most frequently studied medication and is effective. There is less evidence for other antidepressants. But alternatives are worth considering if a fluoxetine trial has not been helpful.\nOn average, doses for bulimia are higher than the average dose for depression, and more similar to the dose for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Because mood and anxiety disorders are often present, medication may be aimed specifically at those disorders.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a health care professional (physician, counselor, psychiatrist) if you have symptoms of bulimia. If you do not feel comfortable doing so, talk to a trusted friend or family member about your concerns and ask them to contact someone for you.\nIf someone you know shows signs of bulimia, gently encourage him or her to contact a physician or mental health professional. Given the common tendency to feel shame and the desire to keep the eating disorder a private matter, it is likely that the person will be reluctant to openly acknowledge the problem. Even so, nonjudgmental prompting may nudge the person to seek help, even if they don't tell you about it. For more information on how to talk to someone you suspect is bulimic, see below.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many people with bulimia recover, especially if their condition is treated early. Unlike patients with anorexia nervosa, patients with bulimia are much less likely to require hospitalization. In long-term follow-up studies, as many as 705 of people with this disorder completely stop having bulimia symptoms. Some do continue to struggle with eating problems of varying degrees of severity.\nTreatment improves chances of improvement. Prognosis is better if the illness starts in adolescence. Prognosis is worse if the person has other psychiatric problems, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mood problem, or a personality disorder, but outcomes are better in those cases if the person also gets treatment for those disorders.\n",

      "What is a bunion?": "A bunion is a firm bump that forms over a bony bulge at the base of the big toe. In most cases, the big toe joint also is enlarged and has degenerative arthritis. The toe also may be pushed toward the second toe (hallux valgus).  Bunions are often painful, especially when wearing stiff shoes that press on the bump.\nBunions tend to be inherited, but they also are common in the following groups:\nAll of these situations force the big toe to drift toward the little toes, and this can cause bunions to form.\n\n",
      "Symptoms of a bunion": "The dominant symptom of a bunion is a big bulging bump on the inside of the base of the big toe. Other symptoms include swelling, soreness and redness around the big toe joint, a tough callus at the bottom of the big toe and persistent or intermittent pain.\n",
      "Diagnosing a bunion": "Before examining your foot, the doctor will ask you about the types of shoes you wear and how often you wear them. He or she also will ask if anyone else in your family has had bunions or if you have had any previous injury to the foot.\nIn most cases, your doctor can diagnose a bunion just by examining your foot. During this exam, you will be asked to move your big toe up and down to see if you can move it as much as you should be able to. The doctor also will look for signs of redness and swelling and ask if the area is painful. Your doctor may want to order X-rays of the foot to check for other causes of pain, to determine whether there is significant arthritis and to see if the bones are aligned properly.\n",
      "Expected duration of a bunion": "A bunion can develop at any time during childhood or adulthood. It will remain until it is treated.\n",
      "Preventing a bunion": "To help prevent bunions, select your style and size of shoes wisely. Choose shoes with a wide toe area and a half-inch of space between the tip of your longest toe and the end of the shoe. Shoes also should conform to the shape of your feet without causing too much pressure.\n",
      "Treating a bunion": "Treatment options are based on the severity of the deformity and symptoms. Nonsurgical treatments usually are enough to relieve the pain and pressure on the big toe. Your doctor may tell you to start wearing roomy, comfortable shoes and use toe padding or a special corrective device that slips into your shoes to push the big toe back into its proper position. To help relieve pain, you can take over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others).\nTo end persistent pain, your doctor may recommend a type of foot surgery called a bunionectomy to remove the bunion and perhaps to reshape the first toe joint. During the operation, the swollen tissue will be removed, the big toe will be straightened if necessary, and the bones of the affected joint may be reshaped or permanently joined. The goal of the surgery is to correct the cause of the bunion and to prevent the bunion from growing back. After surgery, pain medication will be prescribed, and you will be told when you can start moving your toes and ankle.\n\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a health care professional if you have persistent pain and a visible bump along the first toe, difficulty moving your toe or foot or difficulty finding shoes that fit properly because of pain or because the first toe has changed shape.\n",
      "Prognosis": "For people with mild symptoms and a small bunion, the outlook is excellent. For people who have a bunion removed surgically, the prognosis is also excellent for long-term relief from discomfort and deformity, although after surgery, full recovery can take two months or more.\n",

      "What is bursitis?": "A bursa is a membrane-lined sac near a joint that acts as a cushion between the muscle and bone. The bursa reduces friction caused by movement and makes the joint more flexible.\n\nHealthy shoulder\nBursitis is inflammation of a bursa. It is a common condition that often happens when a joint is overused, such as when throwing a baseball or painting a wall. More rarely, bursitis can be caused by gout or an infection. Bursitis is more common in people who are overweight, elderly or diabetic, although it also develops in younger, healthy people without a clear reason.\n\nShoulder with bursitis (inflamed bursa)\n",
      "Symptoms of bursitis": "Symptoms include:\n",
      "Diagnosing bursitis": "After reviewing your symptoms and recent activities, your doctor will examine you and press on the painful area to determine whether the pain is located over a bursa. Typically, your doctor will be able to move the joint through its normal range of motion, but if you try to move the joint yourself, you may not be able to move it as far because of pain. Your doctor also may order X-rays to check for other conditions. If you have bursitis, the X-rays will often be normal, although a small calcium deposit may be present. If your doctor suspects that gout or an infection is causing your bursitis, he or she may recommend that you have a test in which a sample of the fluid is removed from the bursa for analysis. This is a minor procedure.\n",
      "Expected duration of bursitis": "Bursitis usually lasts for only days or weeks, but it can last months or years, especially if the cause, such as overuse, is not identified or changed.\n",
      "Preventing bursitis": "The best way to prevent the most common type of bursitis is to avoid repetitive motion of a joint, especially if you are overweight. Losing weight may reduce the risk of developing bursitis in your legs. If repeated stress on a bursa cannot be avoided, protective gear can help prevent bursitis. For example, carpet layers who spend time kneeling may need protective knee gear.\n",
      "Treating bursitis": "If you modify your activities and rest the joint, symptoms should go away within days or sometimes weeks. In the meantime, you may want to take an anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) to relieve discomfort and reduce the inflammation. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and physical therapy also may be effective. If bursitis is caused by an infection, you may need drainage of the bursa and treatment with an antibiotic. When the pain is intense or does not improve in a short period, your doctor may inject a corticosteroid drug directly into the area. However, repeated steroid injections over a short time can be damaging and steroid injections are avoided when infection is present.\nWhen bursitis occurs repeatedly in the same joint, the bursa may be removed surgically, although this is rare. Surgery also may be needed if you have an infection in the bursa that does not clear up when you take antibiotics.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have significant pain or swelling in or near a joint, contact your health care professional.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for most people with bursitis is excellent. The condition usually lasts a short time and improves rapidly with treatment. A small number of people with bursitis will be bothered for a prolonged period. However, even in those cases, bursitis rarely leads to disability or permanent deterioration in function.\n",

      "What is it?": "Campylobacteriosis is an infection by one of several species ofCampylobacterbacteria, particularlyCampylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni).This infection typically causes diarrhea. The infection also can cause fever and abdominal cramps.\nHumans usually become infected withCampylobacterafter eating poorly prepared meat, especially undercooked chicken.Campylobacteris one of the most common bacterial causes of foodborne illness.\nInfants have an especially high rate of campylobacteriosis because of their immature immune defenses. Young adults also are at higher risk of infection, possibly because they have less experience cooking and handling raw meats. So, they may be exposed more often to potentially contaminated foods.\nMost healthy people probably develop some degree of immunity againstCampylobacteras they mature. This may account for the lower number of cases ofCampylobacterinfection in middle-aged and older adults.\nBesides being transmitted to humans in tainted, undercooked meat,Campylobacteralso can contaminate unpasteurized milk and untreated water. In addition,Campylobacterbacteria sometimes infect humans who have handled raw meat (especially poultry), touched a sick pet that has diarrhea, or traveled to undeveloped countries where sanitation is poor. Although it is possible to develop campylobacteriosis after direct contact with an infected person, this is not common.\nPeople with weakened immune systems are more likely to become infected withCampylobacter. They also tend to have symptoms that are more severe.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Some people who have aCampylobacterinfection have mild symptoms, such as a few loose stools per day. These people probably would not seek medical attention, since the symptoms would resolve on their own.\nWhen full-blown symptoms occur, they usually begin two to seven days after exposure toCampylobacter.At first, you may have a 12- to 48-hour period of fever, headache, muscle aches, and malaise (a general feeling of sickness). These early symptoms are followed by crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. There may be up to 10 loose stools watery stools per day. You may notice some blood in the stool.\n\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may suspect that you have some sort of food-related illness based on your history and symptoms. If your symptoms are very typical and not severe, the treatment for most food-related illnesses is the same. The only way to confirm that you definitely have been infected withCampylobacteris to collect a stool sample for examination in a laboratory (called a stool culture). However, a stool culture is often not needed.\nSome patients have symptoms that are not typical. In those cases, the doctor would send the stool culture and also recommend additional tests such as CT scan.\n",
      "Expected duration": "In adults who have normal immune defenses,Campylobacterinfection is usually a self-limited illness that goes away on its own within seven to 10 days. With antibiotic treatment, symptoms often stop sooner, usually in about five days.\n",
      "Prevention": "Uncooked commercial chicken, raw veal, and raw ground beef are frequent sources ofCampylobacter.To help prevent infection:\nIf your pet becomes sick with diarrhea, wash your hands thoroughly after you have cared for it. Keep sick pets away from infants, elderly family members, and family members with weakened immune systems.\n",
      "Treatment": "The first goal in treatingCampylobacter-related diarrhea is to replace lost body fluids and electrolytes (chemical substances involved in many body processes). If you have severe diarrhea, you may be at risk of developing dehydration. To treat your dehydration, your doctor will prescribe oral or intravenous (IV) fluids.\nBecauseCampylobacterinfections are usually self-limited, your doctor may not treat you with an antibiotic if you are otherwise healthy. However, antibiotic treatment is usually necessary in the following situations:\nWhen an antibiotic is needed to treatC.jejuniinfections, azithromycin (Zithromax) should be the first choice. Although most strains will respond to fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin (Levaquin) or ciprofloxacin (Cipro), antibiotic resistance and side effects are more common with these types of antibiotics.\nTo slow down the diarrhea, your doctor may recommend loperamide (Imodium, generic versions) or another anti-diarrheal drug.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly if you develop severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, or severe abdominal pain. Your doctor will considerCampylobacterinfection as one of several reasons for your symptoms. Infants, elderly adults, and people with a weakened immune system need urgent medical evaluation if they develop symptoms ofCampylobacterinfection.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most otherwise healthy adults recover fromCampylobacterinfection within several days. Occasionally diarrhea may persist for up to 10 days. Complications other than dehydration are very uncommon. One rare complication is Guillain-Barr' syndrome. In this condition,Campylobacter jejunisomehow triggers the immune system to attack nerves, causing weakness and sometimes paralysis.\nIn patients with reactive arthritis, aCampylobacterinfection can trigger an arthritis flare in one or more joints, usually within seven to 10 days after the diarrhea begins.\n",

      "What is cancer?": "Cancer is not a single disease. It's a group of diseases characterized by their ability to cause cells to change abnormally and grow out of control.\nMost types of cancer form atumor, a lump or mass of cancerous cells. Cells from a tumor may break away and travel to other parts of the body, where they can settle and multiply. This spreading process is calledmetastasis.New cancers that have broken off and spread from the original tumor are called metastases.\nNot all tumors are cancerous or malignant; some are benign (non-malignant), don't spread, and aren't life-threatening. And a few cancers don't form masses or lumps, such as those that affect the blood, such as leukemia.\n",
      "Symptoms of cancer": "Symptoms vary widely depending on the type, location, size, and extent of the cancer.\nSome cancers can exist for many years without causing any symptoms or decreasing life expectancy. Common examples are small, non-aggressive prostate and breast cancers.\nOther cancers can be relatively small and localized to one spot but cause significant pain. Widespread cancer can often lead to marked fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, and weight loss.\nSome cancers release substances into the blood that can cause symptoms unrelated to the location or size of the original tumor. For example, one type of lung cancer produces chemicals that trigger unusual neurological symptoms.\n",
      "Diagnosing cancer": "Your doctor will review your medical history and perform a thorough physical examination. He or she will ask about your family history of cancer.\nIn the initial phase of diagnostic evaluation, blood tests and CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are performed. Depending on the results, follow-up tests may include MRI and PET scans.\nAlmost always, a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to provide information that will guide prognosis and therapy.\n",
      "Expected duration of cancer": "How long cancer lasts depends on its type and response to treatment. Some cancers grow so slowly that they persist, but never cause harm. Other cancers can grow and spread quickly despite therapy.\n",
      "Preventing cancer": "The number one way to prevent the most dangerous types of cancer is to not smoke cigarettes or use other tobacco products.\nOther ways to help prevent cancer include:\n",
      "Treating cancer": "For some cancers, no treatment may be necessary because they are very slow-growing. Low-grade prostate cancer in men over the age of 70 is a good example of a cancer that often does not require immediate treatment.\nMost cancers do require active treatment. If the cancer is confined to only one spot in the body, surgery offers an excellent chance of cure.\nCancers of the bone marrow and lymph nodes are treated with chemotherapy and sometimes bone marrow transplant. The chances of cure for many of these types of cancer have improved dramatically.\nMany other types of cancers are also treated with chemotherapy. The goal may be to control the cancer, rather than cure it.\nOther treatments for cancer may include:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for people diagnosed with cancer continues to improve every year.\n",

      "What is candidiasis?": "Candidiasis is an infection caused by Candida fungi, most often byCandida albicans. These fungi are found almost everywhere in the environment. Some may live harmlessly along with the abundant \"native\" species of bacteria that normally colonize the mouth, gastrointestinal tract and vagina.\nUsually, Candida is kept under control by the native bacteria and by the body's immune defenses. If the mix of native bacteria is changed by antibiotics or the body moisture that surrounds native bacteria undergoes changes in its acidity or chemistry, it can allow yeast to thrive and cause symptoms.\nCandidiasis can affect many parts of the body, causing localized infections or larger illness, depending on the person and his or her general health.\nCandida infections can cause symptoms in healthy people. Usually the yeast infections are limited to the mouth, genital area or skin. However, people with a weakened system from illness or medications such as corticosteroids or anticancer drugs are not only more susceptible to topical infections, they also are more likely to experience a more serious internal infection.\n\nPlaces on and in the body that may be affected by candidiasis include:\n",
      "Symptoms of candidiasis": "Candidiasis causes different symptoms, depending on the site of infection.\n\n",
      "Diagnosing candidiasis": "Your doctor will want details about your medical history. He or she also will ask about your diet and about your recent use of antibiotics or medications that can suppress the immune system. If your doctor suspects cutaneous candidiasis, he or she may ask how you care for your skin and about conditions that expose your skin to excessive moisture.\nOften, your doctor can diagnose thrush, cutaneous candidiasis, or vaginal yeast infection by a simple physical examination. However, if the diagnosis is uncertain, your doctor may obtain a sample by gently scraping the involved surface to examine under a microscope or may send it for culture. A culture is especially helpful if you have a yeast infection that returns after treatment. In this case, the culture can help identify whether the yeast is resistant to usual antifungal therapy. If your doctor suspects that you have an undiagnosed medical illness that increases your risk of candidiasis — such as diabetes, cancer or HIV — blood tests or other procedures may be necessary.\nTo diagnose Candida esophagitis, your doctor may to need to refer you to a specialist who can examine your esophagus with an endoscope, a flexible instrument that is inserted into your throat and allows the doctor to look at the area directly. During this examination, called endoscopy, the doctor will take a sample of tissue (either a biopsy or a \"brushing\") from your esophagus to be examined in a laboratory.\nTo diagnose deep candidiasis, your doctor will draw a sample of blood to be checked in a laboratory for the growth of Candida fungi or other infectious agents.\n",
      "Expected duration of candidiasis": "In otherwise healthy people who have thrush, cutaneous candidiasis, or vaginal yeast infections, Candida infections usually can be eliminated with a short treatment (sometimes a single dose) of antifungal medication. However, in people with AIDS or other diseases that weaken the immune system, Candida infections can be difficult to treat and can return after treatment. In people with weakened immune systems, candidiasis can be life threatening if it passes into the blood and spreads to vital organs.\n",
      "Preventing candidiasis": "In general, you can prevent most Candida infections by keeping your skin clean and dry, by using antibiotics only as your doctor directs, and by following a healthy lifestyle, including proper nutrition. People with diabetes should try to keep their blood sugar under tight control.\n",
      "Treating candidiasis": "Treatment of candidiasis varies, depending on the area affected:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Women that are otherwise healthy can self-treat for simple candida vaginitis. Call your doctor if it persists despite topical therapy or it recurs soon after treatment.\nFor other symptoms that may be caused a candida infection, contact your doctor for advice.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Typically, in otherwise healthy people with superficial candidiasis, a properly treated infection goes away without leaving permanent damage. Superficial candidiasis may take longer to treat and is more likely to recur in people that need long courses of antibiotics.\nIn people with chronic illnesses or weakened immune systems, episodes of candidiasis may be more resistant to treatment and may return after treatment ends. In people with deep candidiasis, those who are diagnosed quickly and treated effectively have the best prognosis, especially if their infection can be stopped before it spreads to major organs.\n",

      "What is carbon monoxide poisoning?": "Carbon monoxide is a tasteless, colorless, odorless gas found in the fumes of fuels that contain carbon, such as wood, coal and gasoline. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a potentially fatal illness that occurs when people breathe in carbon monoxide.\nAll sorts of sources can release carbon monoxide, including cars, trucks, small gasoline engines (like lawnmowers), stoves, lanterns, furnaces, grills, gas ranges, water heaters and clothes dryers. The risk of poisoning is especially high when equipment is used in an enclosed place and ventilation is poor. Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur in victims of smoke inhalation during a fire. More than one-third of carbon monoxide-related deaths occur when the victim is asleep.\nOnce inhaled, carbon monoxide passes from your lungs into your bloodstream, where it attaches to the hemoglobin molecules that normally carry oxygen. Oxygen can't travel on a hemoglobin molecule that already has carbon monoxide attached to it. As exposure continues, the gas hijacks more and more hemoglobin molecules, and the blood gradually loses its ability to carry enough oxygen to meet your body's needs. Without enough oxygen, individual cells suffocate and die, especially in vital organs such as the brain and heart. Carbon monoxide also can act directly as a poison, interfering with cells' internal chemical reactions.\n",
      "Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning": "Symptoms vary depending on the concentration of carbon monoxide in the environment, the length of time you are exposed, and your health. If you are exposed to very high levels of carbon monoxide gas in a poorly ventilated room, you can develop:\nWithout immediate treatment, you can lose consciousness, have a seizure, enter a coma, and potentially die. Death can result from only a few minutes of exposure to higher concentrations or from an hour of exposure to lower levels.\nIf you are exposed to very low levels of carbon monoxide over a longer period (weeks or months), your symptoms can appear like the flu, with headache, fatigue, malaise (a general sick feeling) and sometimes nausea and vomiting. People with long-term exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide also can have numbness, unexplained vision problems, sleep disturbances, and impaired memory and concentration.\n",
      "Diagnosing carbon monoxide poisoning": "If you are unconscious, your doctor's first priority is to stabilize your condition, providing emergency treatment such as oxygen, fluid and treatment for seizures. Information about the exposure will be collected from the emergency personnel, your relatives, or both. This is especially important if you are a victim of smoke inhalation during a fire, because you could have inhaled other toxic gases besides carbon monoxide.\nAfter a poisoning that occurs indoors, your doctor will ask about the condition of fuel-burning appliances and equipment in your home and at work and about the quality of ventilation in these areas. Your doctor will want to know how long you were exposed, whether your symptoms improve when you leave the area, and whether any of your family members or co-workers complain of symptoms similar to yours.\nIf you are pregnant, tell your doctor immediately. Carbon monoxide attaches to fetal hemoglobin at a level 10% to 15% higher than in the mother, placing the fetus at special risk.\nWhen your doctor examines you, he or she will pay particular attention to your nervous (neurological) system. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will draw blood to determine your levels of oxygen and carboxyhemoglobin (carbon monoxide attached to hemoglobin). Additional tests may be needed depending on your specific symptoms. You may need an electrocardiogram (EKG) to evaluate symptoms of chest pain or an irregular heartbeat. In people with neurological symptoms, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain may be needed. In a pregnant woman, the fetus may have to be monitored. An external monitor will be placed on the woman's belly to measure the fetus' heart rate over time to look for signs of distress suggesting low oxygen levels.\n",
      "Expected duration of carbon monoxide poisoning": "Carbon monoxide gas leaves the body the same way it got in, through the lungs. In fresh air, it takes four to six hours for a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning to exhale about half of the inhaled carbon monoxide in their blood. This \"clearing\" time can be increased if the person is given 100% oxygen or is placed in a hyperbaric oxygen (high-pressure oxygen) chamber, which creates a higher oxygen pressure than the normal outside pressure.\nBecause carbon monoxide poisoning can kill body cells, especially in the brain, there is a risk of long-term neurological problems in people who have had severe poisoning.\n",
      "Preventing carbon monoxide poisoning": "Carbon monoxide can kill without warning because it has no color, odor or taste. Here are some suggestions to reduce your risk:\n",
      "Treating carbon monoxide poisoning": "You should immediately get out of the environment with high carbon monoxide level. You should receive oxygen as quickly as possible, preferably high flow oxygen through a non-rebreather mask. This prevents you from inhaling the gas that you just exhaled.\nYou will be taken to an emergency department. If your symptoms disappear after oxygen treatment for several hours and your physical exam and blood tests are normal, you may be able to go home. You may need to schedule a follow-up visit with your doctor to check for complications to your nerves and brain.\nIf you have severe carbon monoxide poisoning and are unconscious, you will be connected to a respirator (a machine that breathes for you) and you will get 100% oxygen. Patients with very severe poisoning may be treated in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You are at risk of carbon monoxide poisoning whenever you are near a fuel-burning appliance or tool. At the first hint of symptoms, move quickly to fresh air. Don't wait for more severe symptoms to start.\nIf you are concerned about the condition of a fuel-burning appliance in your home and you notice headaches, flu-like symptoms or sleep problems, call your doctor.\nIf you suspect that someone else is suffering from severe carbon monoxide poisoning, call for emergency help immediately. If possible, move an unconscious victim to an area with fresh air. Be cautious. Remember that high levels of carbon monoxide can make you sick, too, even before you can bring the victim to safety.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis depends on the severity of carbon monoxide poisoning. Among people with severe symptoms, as many as two out of three people may have long-term complications, especially neurological problems. In people with mild to moderate symptoms, as many as one in five can develop lasting neurological problems. Neurological problems range from mild personality changes to severe intellectual impairment, blindness and deafness. In pregnant women, poisoning can cause fetal death or cerebral palsy in the child.\n",

      "What is a cardiac arrhythmia?": "A cardiac arrhythmia is any abnormal heart rate or rhythm.\nIn normal adults, the heart beats regularly at a rate of 60 to 100 times per minute. And the pulse (felt at the wrist, neck or elsewhere) matches the contractions of the heart's two powerful lower chambers, called the ventricles. The heart's two upper chambers, called the atria, also contract to help fill the ventricles. But this milder contraction occurs just before the ventricles contract, and it is not felt in the pulse.\nUnder normal circumstances, the signal for a heartbeat comes from the heart's sinus node. It's the natural pacemaker located in the upper portion of the right atrium. From the sinus node, the heartbeat signal travels to the atrioventricular node or \"A-V node,\" which is located between the atria. Next the signal travels through the bundle of His (pronounced HISS). It's made up of a series of modified heart muscle fibers located between the ventricles. The signal enters the muscles of the ventricles. This causes the ventricles to contract and produces a heartbeat.\nCardiac arrhythmias sometimes are classified according to their origin as either ventricular arrhythmias (originating in the ventricles) or supraventricular arrhythmias (originating in heart areas above the ventricles, typically the atria). They also can be classified according to their effect on the heart rate, with bradycardia indicating a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute and tachycardia indicating a heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute.\nSome common types of cardiac arrhythmias include:\n\nSome causes of A-V block include cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and medications such as beta blockers and digoxin.\n",
      "Symptoms of a cardiac arrhythmia": "Symptoms of specific arrhythmias include:\n",
      "Diagnosing a cardiac arrhythmia": "Your doctor will ask about your family history of coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, fainting spells or sudden death from heart problems. Your doctor also will review your personal medical history, including any possible risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias (such as coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, thyroid disorders, and medications). You will be asked to describe your specific cardiac symptoms, including any possible triggers for those symptoms.\nDuring the physical examination, your doctor will check your heart rate and rhythm, together with your pulses. This is because certain cardiac arrhythmias cause a mismatch of the pulse and the heart sounds. Your doctor also will check for physical signs of an enlarged heart and for heart murmurs, one sign of a heart valve problem.\nA test called an electrocardiogram (EKG) often can confirm the diagnosis of a cardiac arrhythmia. However, because cardiac arrhythmias may come and go, a one-time office EKG may be normal. If this is the case, an ambulatory EKG may be required. During an ambulatory EKG, the patient wears a portable device that monitors your heart rate and electrical pattern. You will be instructed to press a button to record the EKG reading whenever you experience symptoms. This approach is especially useful if your symptoms are infrequent.\n",
      "Expected duration of a cardiac arrhythmia": "When a patient has ventricular fibrillation, it is an emergency. The patient is unconscious, not breathing, and doesn't have a pulse. If available, electrical cardioversion must be administered as soon as possible. If not available, then cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started.\nHow long a cardiac arrhythmia lasts depends on its cause. For example, atrial fibrillation that is caused by an overactive thyroid may go away when the thyroid problem is treated. However, cardiac arrhythmias that result from progressive or permanent damage to the heart tend to be long-term problems. When a heart attack causes ventricular fibrillation, death can occur within minutes.\n",
      "Preventing a cardiac arrhythmia": "Cardiac arrhythmias that result from coronary artery disease can be prevented by taking the following actions to modify your risk factors:\nCardiac arrhythmias related to medications can be minimized by checking with a health care professional or pharmacist about any potential drug interactions. You might have to switch to another medication or reduce the dose of a problem medication. Ventricular fibrillation resulting from electrical shock can be prevented by following routine safety precautions around live wires and by seeking shelter during electrical storms.\nNot all cardiac arrhythmias can be prevented.\n",
      "Treating a cardiac arrhythmia": "The treatment of a cardiac arrhythmia depends on its cause:\n\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have any symptoms of a cardiac arrhythmia, including palpitations, dizziness, fainting spells, fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain. Call for emergency help immediately whenever someone in your family develops a severely irregular pulse. If you cannot feel a pulse at all, and the person is not breathing, perform CPR until emergency professionals arrive.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for cardiac arrhythmias depends on the type of rhythm disturbance and whether the person has coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or some other heart muscle disorder. The prognosis for ventricular fibrillation is grave, and death follows quickly without emergency treatment. Most atrial arrhythmias have an excellent prognosis. The outlook is good for heart block, even third-degree A-V block, the most serious type.\nThe availability of permanent pacemakers, implanted cardioversion/defibrillation devices and effective medications has improved the prognosis for many people with serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n",

      "Expected duration of cardiomyopathy": "Dilated cardiomyopathy sometimes can be reversed if it is caused by a treatable condition.\nMost cases of hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy are persistent. They can get worse over time.\n",
      "Preventing cardiomyopathy": "The best way to prevent cardiomyopathy is to prevent the diseases that cause it.\nKnow your risk factors for coronary artery disease. Modify those risks early in life.\nYou can reduce your risk for coronary artery disease by\nIf you have any family members with inherited cardiomyopathy, contact your doctor for an evaluation.\n",
      "Treating cardiomyopathy": "The treatment of cardiomyopathy depends on its cause. Here are some of the more common treatments:\nSGLT2 inhibitors are the newest class of drugs that improve outcome in people with cardiomyopathy, especially those with dilated cardiomyopathy.\nFor patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, blockage to the outflow of blood can sometimes be reduced. This is done by damaging part of the muscle between the two ventricles. This damage can be created at surgery or through a catheter.\nA heart transplant may be necessary for patients whose poor heart function has become disabling or life threatening.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have any of the following symptoms:\nCall your doctor immediately if you have chest pain. Call even if you think that you are too young to be having heart problems.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook varies. It depends on the specific cause and severity of the cardiomyopathy.\nThe survival rate of people with most types has improved dramatically in the past decade. This is due to the increased number of treatments available.\n",

      "What is carpal tunnel syndrome?": "In the wrist, nerves and tendons pass through a narrow space called the carpal tunnel.\nA major nerve (the median nerve) that passes through this tight space, can become irritated or compressed. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a combination of numbness, tingling, pain and weakness in the hand caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel.\n\nSymptoms tend to show up most in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and half of the ring finger because the median nerve provides sensation to those areas.\nBecause the carpal tunnel already is narrow, the nerve can become irritated if it narrows even a little more. Injury to the nerve also can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. There are several common causes, including:\nOften, carpal tunnel syndrome occurs without a clear reason. The condition affects women more often than men, perhaps because women normally have smaller carpal tunnels. It can occur in one or both hands.\n",
      "Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome": "Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome can include:\nSymptoms may appear first at night and are most noticeable in the thumb and the index and middle fingers. People with carpal tunnel syndrome often describe awakening with a tingling sensation and the need to shake out the hands to recover normal feeling. There can be pain in the wrist that radiates into the hand or into the forearm. If the condition is not treated, the muscles of the thumb can waste away so that the normal mound of muscles at the base of the thumb eventually flattens.\n",
      "Diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome": "The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome can be strongly suspected based on the description of symptoms. Your doctor will look for decreased feeling in your fingers and for muscle weakness in your hand. Your doctor will check your thumb muscles for signs of wasting and your wrists for signs of arthritis. Your doctor may check whether fluid is accumulating in several different parts of your body, including your hands, feet and legs, since extra fluid can add pressure in the carpal tunnel.\nThe examination will probably include tests to check whether the nerves in your wrist are working well. The Tinel's test is done by tapping over the median nerve at the wrist. In Phalen's maneuver, the wrist is flexed for 30 to 60 seconds. If you develop pain, numbness or tingling during these tests, the median nerve in the carpal tunnel may be compressed.\nDoctors usually diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome based on a combination of your history of hand symptoms and the physical examination. X-rays are rarely helpful. Your doctor can confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome by ordering nerve tests (called nerve-conduction studies) of the median nerve in your affected hand. These tests are not perfect, however. In some people, symptoms or an examination suggest carpal tunnel syndrome, but the nerve tests are normal. Your doctor may order blood tests to look for evidence of diabetes or thyroid disease since these are common triggers of carpal tunnel syndrome. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may be helpful when the diagnosis remains uncertain.\n",
      "Expected duration of carpal tunnel syndrome": "How long carpal tunnel syndrome lasts depends on the cause. Sometimes symptoms come and go and don't require immediate treatment. A person who has carpal tunnel syndrome caused by overuse during sports may recover quickly with treatment, rest and modified activity. In someone whose carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by arthritis, symptoms may be more stubborn and require longer therapy.\n",
      "Preventing carpal tunnel syndrome": "If you type or use a computer keyboard, you can decrease your risk of carpal tunnel syndrome by making sure that you work in a \"wrist neutral\" position, with the wrist joint straight, not bent up or down. To help you do this, several types of office aids are available, including a cushioned wrist rest and a keyboard tray that adjusts to a position below the work surface. Newer keyboards are being developed, including ones that split the keys into left-hand and right-hand groups, and others that bend the keyboard into a tent shape. You also may need to check the position of your hand when you use a computer mouse or trackball because some experts suspect that people who use these computer accessories consistently are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. If you continue to have symptoms, you may want to have a professional check your workstation.\nImage: Thinkstock/Getty Images\nTo prevent sports-related carpal tunnel syndrome, ask your trainer or a sports medicine physician about effective ways to support your wrist during high-risk activities.\n",
      "Treating carpal tunnel syndrome": "In most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, treatment begins with a wrist splint to be worn mainly at night. You may also receive anti-inflammatory medication to decrease pain and numbness. Injections of cortisone may help reduce swelling, but they tend to provide only temporary relief. For people who don't improve with nonsurgical treatments, surgery can relieve pressure on the median nerve by cutting a ligament at the bottom of the wrist, which creates more room for the nerve in the carpal tunnel.\nImage: Daisy-Daisy/Getty Images\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you feel pain, tingling or numbness in your fingers that does not go away. If you have trouble grasping objects, making a fist or have weakness in your hand or arm, you should see your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis of carpal tunnel syndrome depends on the cause. For example, when it occurs in the setting of longstanding, poorly controlled diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, the nerve injury may be permanent. However, most people with carpal tunnel syndrome recover completely with treatment.\n",

      "What are cataracts?": "The eye's lens is a transparent structure that focuses images on the light-sensitive retina. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens. They occur when certain proteins in the lens form abnormal clumps. These clumps gradually get larger and interfere with vision. They distort or block the passage of light through the lens. \"Cataract\" means \"huge waterfall\" or \"enormous downpour,\" which is how some people describe their clouded sight, like trying to look through a waterfall.\nCataracts are the world's leading cause of blindness, accounting for about 40% of all cases of blindness. In the United States, most cataracts are age-related and affect more than half of all Americans older than 65 to some degree. Risk factors for developing cataracts at an earlier than expected age include prolonged exposure to bright sunlight and smoking. In many cases, cataracts are age-related. They first appear in the 40s or 50s, but may not affect vision until after age 60. In other cases, cataracts may be caused by eye trauma, long-term diabetes, corticosteroid medications, or radiation treatments.\nIn infants, cataracts can be present since birth (congenital) or can occur as a result of an infection that happened during pregnancy, especially toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, syphilis, rubella, or herpes simplex. In infants and young children, cataracts also can be one symptom of a disease that affects how the body processes carbohydrates, amino acids, calcium or copper.\n",
      "Symptoms of cataracts": "Cataracts typically do not cause any symptoms until they have grown large enough to interfere significantly with vision. Once symptoms of cataracts develop, they can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing cataracts": "Your doctor will suspect cataracts based on your age, medical history, and symptoms. Your doctor can diagnose cataracts by widening (dilating) your pupil with medication and examining your eye. You also will have a visual acuity test, which uses an eye chart to check the effect of the cataract on your vision.\n",
      "Expected duration of cataracts": "Cataracts are long-term problems. In most patients, vision gets worse over time.\n",
      "Preventing cataracts": "In general, there is no way to prevent age-related cataracts. However, people with diabetes may decrease their risk of developing cataracts by controlling their blood sugar. To help prevent infection-related cataracts in a fetus, women should check with their doctors about the need for rubella immunizations before becoming pregnant. Pregnant women should see a health care professional regularly for prenatal care.\n",
      "Treating cataracts": "Although some people with cataracts can improve their vision by using eyeglasses, magnifying lenses, or stronger lighting, the only way to cure cataracts is with surgery. When you consider whether to have surgery, you'll need to weigh how bad your vision is against the small risk of surgery.\nCataract surgery involves removing the clouded lens and then either replacing it with a plastic lens inserted in the eye during surgery or wearing a contact lens or special cataract glasses.\nCurrent surgical options are:\nAfter the lens is removed, it is replaced by one of three options:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have trouble seeing clearly. If you are older than 40, schedule an eye exam every two years, even if you have not noticed any change in your vision.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Cataract surgery improves the vision of 95% of patients who have it. In patients who have intraocular lens replacements, 90% have 20/40 vision or better. In some people who have had extracapsular surgery, part of the lens capsule eventually becomes cloudy, causing a condition called an after-cataract. This can be corrected with laser surgery.\n",

      "What is celiac disease (non-tropical sprue)?": "Celiac disease (also called non-tropical sprue, celiac sprue, gluten intolerance and gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is an intestinal disorder in which the body cannot tolerate gluten. Gluten is a natural protein in many grains, including wheat, barley, rye and oats.\nPeople with celiac disease have an immune reaction that is triggered by gluten. The immune reaction causes inflammation at the surface of the small intestine where it damages small structures - villi - on the surface of the intestine. It also damages smaller, hair-sized protrusions called microvilli. Healthy villi and microvilli are needed for normal digestion. When they are damaged, the intestine cannot absorb nutrients properly and you can become malnourished.\n\nA tendency to develop celiac disease is genetic (inherited). Celiac disease is most common among people of northern European descent. Celiac disease is not always recognized because the symptoms can be mild and can be wrongly blamed upon other common intestinal issues. Celiac disease can be diagnosed at any age.\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune condition because the body's own immune system damages the intestinal villi, even though the process is started by eating gluten. People with celiac disease also are more likely to develop other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes. A few conditions frequently coexist with celiac disease, including dermatitis herpetiformis (an itchy, blistering skin rash) and liver inflammation. People who have Down syndrome have a higher risk of developing celiac disease than is typical.\n",
      "Symptoms of celiac disease": "Symptoms and their severity can vary. Some symptoms come from inflammation in the intestines. Other symptoms come from a lack of nutrients, due to the failure of your intestine to digest food properly.\nChildren generally develop symptoms only after they start eating foods that contain gluten. Common symptoms include:\nIn adults, symptoms may include:\n",
      "Diagnosing celiac disease": "Celiac disease will cause symptoms as long as you continue to eat gluten. If a person with celiac disease follows a strict gluten-free diet, the intestines can heal and the disease can be controlled. Any exposure to gluten can trigger a recurrence of symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration of celiac disease": "Celiac disease will cause symptoms as long as you continue to eat gluten. If a person with celiac disease follows a strict gluten-free diet, the intestines can heal and the disease can be controlled. Any exposure to gluten can trigger a recurrence of symptoms.\n",
      "Preventing celiac disease": "Because celiac disease is a genetic disorder and because gluten is encountered in almost everyone's diet, there is no practical way to prevent it. If it does occur, you can stop intestinal damage and eliminate your symptoms by following a strict, gluten-free diet. Although it is not proven, some experts suspect that if celiac disease runs in your family you may be able to delay the disease for your own children or reduce the likelihood that they will get the disease by breast-feeding, so that you delay the introduction of other foods to your infant's diet.\n",
      "Treating celiac disease": "Effective treatment sounds simple: Just eliminate gluten from your diet, the intestinal damage will be cured over time, and your symptoms will go away. That's easier said than done, however.\nMany products contain gluten. Some products, especially prepared foods, may not list gluten as an ingredient. Today there are many online and print publications to help people with celiac disease avoid gluten in their diet.\nHere are some basic tips on avoiding gluten:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your health care professional if you have chronic diarrhea, chronic fatigue, or weight loss that is unintentional or progressive. The most serious children's symptoms such as failing growth likely will be discovered during routine checkups. You should call your pediatrician if your child develops unexplained weight loss, abdominal pain, prolonged diarrhea, repeated episodes of abdominal bloating, or frequent pain after eating.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people who follow a strict gluten-free diet can expect symptoms to improve in a few weeks, and the damage to the intestinal villi typically is reversed in a few months. As long as the diet is followed, people with celiac disease should be able to lead normal lives with no further symptoms. People with celiac disease are at risk of developing another autoimmune disorder. People with celiac disease also have an increased risk of developing small bowel lymphoma, a cancer of the small intestine. Therefore, your physician should consider these possibilities if new problems or symptoms occur.\nLeft untreated, celiac disease can lead to severe malnutrition and can put you at risk of serious consequences, including osteoporosis (thin bones), anemia, infertility, neuropathy (damaged nerves) and seizures.\n",

      "What is cellulitis?": "Cellulitis is a serious bacterial infection of the skin. Bacteria break through the skin's protective outer layer, typically at the site of an injury, such as a cut, puncture, sore, burn or bite. Cellulitis can occur at the site of surgery, or where there is a catheter. Once beneath the skin surface, bacteria multiply and make chemicals that cause inflammation in the skin.\nCellulitis that is not caused by a wound or catheter most often occurs on the legs and feet. However, it can develop on any part of the body, including the trunk, arms and face. It often develops where there is edema (swelling), poor blood flow, or a skin rash that creates breaks in the skin, such as a fungus infection between the toes (athlete's foot).\nMany types of bacteria can cause cellulitis. Most cases are caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (strep) or Staphylococcus aureus (staph). A strain of staph known as community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcal aureus, or \"community-acquired MRSA\" can lead to blistering of the skin and a deeper, more serious infection.\nLess common bacteria varieties can cause infection after animal bites, puncture wounds through wet shoes, or wounds exposed to freshwater lakes, aquariums, or swimming pools. When cellulitis is located around an eye socket, it is named periorbital cellulites. Because infection around the eye can spread to the brain if it is not quickly treated with antibiotics, periorbital cellulitis requires prompt medical attention.\nMedical conditions that are closely related to cellulitis include:\n",
      "Symptoms of cellulitis": "In cellulitis, the affected skin feels warm and is usually red, swollen and painful. The redness can be slight or can stand out compared to surrounding skin. The area of warmth can be felt with the back of the hand, especially when compared to surrounding skin. There may be a spreading network of red streaks in the skin, caused by infection in the vessels that carry lymph (tissue fluid), as well as enlarged lymph nodes (swollen glands) near the area of infection.\n\nFever and a general sick feeling (malaise) often accompany cellulitis. Severe infections can cause low blood pressure if bacteria get into the bloodstream. Bloodstream infections (blood poisoning) from cellulitis are particularly dangerous in the very young and very old, as well as in those with weakened immune systems or abnormal heart valves.\n",
      "Diagnosing cellulitis": "Many people who develop cellulitis have no other medical problems and no obvious injury or skin damage that allowed the infection to occur.\nYour doctor can usually diagnose cellulitis based on your recent medical history, your symptoms and a physical examination. Your doctor may recommend tests to look for other conditions that may mimic cellulitis. For example, an ultrasound of the veins in your leg can help detect a blood clot. X-rays can help to determine whether the skin infection has spread to the bone.\nIn most cases, your doctor is not able to specifically tell you what bacteria type has caused your infection. Studies have shown that culture of the skin is not useful. An antibiotic can be chosen that kills most bacteria types that are causes of cellulitis. Your treatment can be adjusted if you are not improving.\n",
      "Expected duration of cellulitis": "How long cellulitis lasts depends on the extent of the cellulitis, the bacteria that caused the infection and your general health. Without proper antibiotic treatment, some forms of cellulitis can cause serious complications within a few days, even in otherwise healthy people.\n",
      "Preventing cellulitis": "To help prevent cellulitis:\n",
      "Treating cellulitis": "Cellulitis is treated with antibiotics. Your doctor will choose a specific antibiotic depending on the site of your cellulitis and the likely cause of your infection. Most cases of cellulitis improve quickly once you start taking antibiotics.\nIf you have mild cellulitis, you can usually treat it at home with antibiotics taken by mouth. However, keep in touch with your doctor to be sure that the infection is improving as expected. At home, warm compresses, such as a warm, moist washcloth, and elevating the infected area can help.\nIf you have severe cellulitis, you may need to be treated in the hospital with antibiotics given intravenously (into a vein).\nCommunity-acquired MRSA infections may worsen despite antibiotic treatment, because the antibiotics that are most commonly selected to treat cellulitis do not reliably kill this bacteria. If within the first two or three days of treatment you don't have obvious improvement in your skin pain, redness, and swelling, or if you develop blisters or pus on the surface of your skin rash, contact your doctor immediately. These can be signs of community-acquired MRSA infection.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever a skin injury becomes red, warm, swollen or tender. Call your doctor promptly if you get a deep puncture wound, especially on a hand or foot, or if you are bitten by an animal or human.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, symptoms of cellulitis begin to improve within 24 to 48 hours after starting treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Always take all the antibiotics prescribed by your doctor, even if you think your infection has been cured. The prognosis is generally good, but the condition can return, especially in people with poor circulation, chronic (long-term) swelling in the legs or skin that is in poor condition.\n",

      "What are cervical polyps?": "The cervix is a tube-like channel that connects the uterus to the vagina. Cervical polyps are growths that usually appear on the cervix where it opens into the vagina. Polyps are usually cherry-red to reddish-purple or grayish-white. They vary in size and often look like bulbs on thin stems. Cervical polyps are usually not cancerous (benign) and can occur alone or in groups. Most polyps are small, about 1 centimeter to 2 centimeters long. Because rare types of cancerous conditions can look like polyps, all polyps should be removed and examined for signs of cancer.\n\nThe cause of cervical polyps is not well understood, but they are associated with inflammation of the cervix. They also may result from an abnormal response to the female hormone estrogen.\nCervical polyps are relatively common, especially in women older than 20 who have had at least one child. They are rare in girls who have not started menstruating. There are two types of cervical polyps:\n",
      "Symptoms of cervical polyps": "Cervical polyps may not cause any symptoms. However, you may experience:\n",
      "Diagnosing cervical polyps": "If you have a cervical polyp, you probably won't be able to feel it or see it. Cervical polyps are discovered during routine pelvic exams or evaluations for bleeding or while getting a Pap test.\n",
      "Expected duration of cervical polyps": "Sometimes a polyp will come off on its own during sexual intercourse or menstruation. However, most polyps need to be removed to treat any symptoms and to evaluate the tissue for signs of cancer, which is rare.\n",
      "Preventing cervical polyps": "Visit your doctor for an annual Pap test and for regular pelvic exams. A direct examination is the best way to identify cervical polyps.\n",
      "Treating cervical polyps": "Unless the doctor is sure the polyp is benign, he or she will have it removed. Often this can be done in the doctor's office. The doctor will use a special instrument, called a polyp forceps, to grasp the base of the polyp stem and then gently pluck the polyp with a gentle, twisting motion. Bleeding is usually brief and limited. Nonprescription, mild pain medication such as acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) can help to relieve discomfort or cramping during or after the procedure.\nThe polyp or polyps are sent to a laboratory for examination. You may receive antibiotics if the polyp shows signs of infection. If the polyp is cancerous, treatment will depend on the extent and type of cancer.\nLarge polyps and polyp stems that are very broad usually need to be removed in an operating room using local, regional or general anesthesia. You will not need to stay in the hospital overnight. Cervical polyps may grow in the future from different areas of the cervix, usually not from the original site. Regular pelvic examination will help to identify and treat polyps before they cause symptoms.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience vaginal discharge, bleeding after intercourse, or bleeding between periods, make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible for a pelvic exam.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is excellent. The vast majority of cervical polyps are not cancerous. Once removed, polyps usually don't come back.\n",

      "What is it?": "The cervix is the donut-shaped opening to the uterus. Cervicitis is an inflammation and irritation of the cervix. Symptoms of cervicitis can be similar to vaginitis, with vaginal discharge, itching or pain with intercourse.\nCervicitis can be caused by a sexually transmitted infection. Most common are chlamydia and gonorrhea. Trichomoniasis and genital herpes can also cause cervicitis. In some cases, cervicitis is not caused by infection. It may be due to trauma, frequent douching or exposure to chemical irritants.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Cervicitis often causes no symptoms at all, but some women will experience pain during intercourse, vaginal itching, a bloody vaginal discharge, or vaginal spotting or bleeding between periods (usually after vaginal intercourse). If the urethra (urine tube) also becomes infected, you may feel burning when you urinate or you may urinate more often. Cervicitis can spread to your uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries, which is a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). If you have PID, you may have abdominal pain or fever.\n\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history and whether you have any new sexual partners. He or she will do a pelvic exam to look at your cervix. This is done with a device called a speculum. This is a metal or plastic device shaped like a duckbill that holds the vagina open.\nIf you have cervicitis, the lining of the cervix may appear red, inflamed, swollen or irritated. In more severe cases, pus may be coming from the cervix. During the pelvic exam, your doctor will take a sample of discharge or pus from your cervical opening so it can be tested in a laboratory and examined under a microscope to determine if you have an infection such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis or genital herpes. He or she may also check for yeast or bacterial vaginosis. These infections can cause similar symptoms, though they affect the vagina rather than the cervix.\nYour doctor also will examine your pelvic area using his or her fingers to look for tenderness of the cervix, uterus or ovaries. To do this, the health care professional will place his or her fingers inside your vagina. Be sure to tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before he or she puts on gloves for the examination.\nIf your cervix, uterus or ovaries are tender, it's possible you have pelvic inflammatory disease (infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries) in addition to cervicitis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once cervicitis is diagnosed and the appropriate treatment is started, symptoms should start to improve within a few days. If there are any signs of PID, you will need to take antibiotics for two weeks.\n",
      "Prevention": "Cervicitis most often is caused by a sexually transmitted infection, so it is important to use a condom every time you have sex and to limit the number of sexual partners you have. If you are diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection, your recent sexual partners also should get tested and treated.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment is guided by the type of infection you have. If you have risk factors for a sexually transmitted infection, such as unprotected vaginal intercourse with a new or multiple sexual partners, or if the physical examination suggests you may have cervicitis, you may start treatment with antibiotics before the test results come back.\nGonorrhea is usually treated with an injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and one dose of oral azithromycin. Chlamydia is typically treated with oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline (sold under several brand names), azithromycin (Zithromax), or levofloxacin (Levaquin). Trichomoniasis is treated with the antibiotic metronidazole. If you are allergic to any of these antibiotics, an alternative can be prescribed.\nIf you have genital herpes, an antiviral medication can be prescribed. This could be acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex) or famciclovir (Famvir). You will need to take the medication for up to 10 days the first time you develop genital herpes. For recurrent herpes outbreaks, you can take the medication for three to five days.\nIf you are diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection, it is important to tell any recent sexual partners that they must see a health care professional for testing and treatment.\nCervicitis caused by trauma or an IUD is treated with an antibiotic targeted to the type of bacteria. The associated inflammation will heal within days to a few weeks. It will help to avoid sexual intercourse until symptoms improve to avoid any further irritation to the cervix.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have recurring pain during intercourse, a new vaginal discharge or discharge that has changed in color, or if you have vaginal spotting or bleeding between periods, you should make an appointment to see a health care professional.\nIf your symptoms also include fever or abdominal pain, see a health care professional as soon as possible.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Cervicitis will go away within a few days to a week after you start taking antibiotics. If you have pelvic inflammatory disease, it may take a few weeks to treat the infection completely. Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause more serious problems, such as infertility or pain from scar tissue. Although these additional conditions can be treated, they sometimes require surgery.\nCervicitis rarely comes back if it is treated with the appropriate antibiotic, unless you get a new infection from a sexual partner. Genital herpes cannot be cured. However, if you develop recurrent disease, you can decrease the frequency and severity of outbreaks by taking an antiviral medication.\n",

      "What is a chemical injury to the eye?": "Eyes can be damaged by solid, liquid, powder or aerosol chemicals. Chemical injuries that happen in the home are most likely to be caused by soaps, disinfectants, solvents, cosmetics, drain cleaners, oven cleaners, ammonia and bleach. In agricultural settings, fertilizers or pesticides can cause eye damage. In industry, many irritating chemicals and solvents can injure the eye.\nA chemical eye injury is an emergency. Damage can occur within one to five minutes. Most of the time, however, chemicals that come in contact with the eye cause only surface damage and no loss of vision. Caustic (alkaline) chemicals cause the worst damage. These include ammonia, drain cleaners, automatic dish washing detergents and oven cleaners.\n",
      "Symptoms of a chemical injury to the eye": "Symptoms include:\n",
      "Diagnosing a chemical injury to the eye": "After your eye has been rinsed completely, your doctor will measure the pH (acidity) of the tears in your eye to make sure the chemicals have been washed out. Then your doctor will inspect your eye for damage and test your vision with an eye chart.\nNormally, the doctor can see inside by using a handheld ophthalmoscope. However, after chemical injuries, a whitish, hazy area can appear in the clear part of the cornea. This can block clear vision, and it may prevent your doctor from seeing inside the eyeball through the pupil. If any significant damage has occurred, your doctor probably will recommend that you see an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) for a more complete inspection and vision testing.\n",
      "Expected duration of a chemical injury to the eye": "How long symptoms last depends on the type of chemical and the amount that has gotten into the eye.\n",
      "Preventing a chemical injury to the eye": "To prevent chemical damage to the eye, wear protective goggles whenever working with chemicals.\nIf your eye is exposed to chemicals, the most important way you can limit the damage is to start flushing the eye with water immediately. Use a strong steady stream of clean water. Arrange for immediate evaluation by a doctor. Continue the flushing until you are ready to go.\n",
      "Treating a chemical injury to the eye": "Chemical eye injury required immediate medical care. But even before you arrange transportation to an emergency department, you should begin to rinse the eye with a continuous stream of water as soon as possible. It is best to use cool running water and to continue to rinse for at least 10 minutes. Some industrial locations have special fountains for washing eyes. If a fountain is not available, open your eyelids with your fingers and hold your head under a faucet. Allow water to run from the bridge of your nose outward across the eye so you don't expose the other eye to the chemical you are rinsing out. If both eyes are affected, you can either alternate sides or allow the water to flow over both eyes at once.\nIf you can't put your eye under a faucet, have someone help you. You can lie down on your side or hold your head sideways over a sink, and your helper can pour water from a cup across your eye while you hold the eyelids open.  Eye irrigation should continue during transport to the emergency department.\nIf you are wearing contact lenses, do not try to remove them before washing your eye. If the lens is still in your eye after several minutes of flushing with water, you should try to remove it.\nDo NOT rub your eyes, even after flushing them with water.\nA doctor should evaluate every chemical eye injury. The doctor will usually start irrigating the eye using a saline solution. He or she probably will apply anesthetic drops to the eye before rinsing it. The eyelids may be held open with a gentle instrument. After a complete rinse, your doctor will test the pH (acidity) of the eye. He or she will continue rinsing the eye until the pH is normal or near normal. In some cases, particularly after severe alkali burns, rinsing may need to be continued for as long as 24 hours. The doctor places a soft tube in the eye that connects to a bag of sterile saline solution (similar to an intravenous set up).\nWhen the rinse is complete, the doctor will examine the eye and remove any foreign particles. He or she also may touch the cornea with a small instrument called a tonometer to check the pressure inside the eyeball. This is the same test used to screen for glaucoma.\nAntibiotic ointment will be put into your eye to prevent infection, and a topical steroid may be used to reduce inflammation. If the eye's internal pressure is elevated, the doctor also will prescribe eye drops to lower the pressure and prevent glaucoma. The eye usually will be bandaged with a patch that places slight pressure on the eye to keep it closed. If the injury is serious, you may have to be hospitalized so that health care professionals can monitor the pressure in your eye and the healing of the cornea, the transparent part of the eyeball that lets light in.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Chemical injury to the eye is serious and can threaten your vision. Seek immediate emergency medical care (after you have rinsed the eye) any time an eye is exposed to a chemical.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for recovery from chemical injury varies depending on the nature and extent of the exposure. Most people recover completely. However, possible complications include glaucoma, damage to the cornea and dry eye syndrome. In the most severe cases, chemical exposure can lead to blindness or loss of the eye.\n",

      "What is chickenpox (varicella)?": "Chickenpox is an infection that causes an itchy, blistering rash and is very contagious, meaning it is spread easily from one person to another. It is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which enters the body through the mouth and nose after contact with an infected person.\n\nA person with chickenpox can spread the disease to someone else from one day before the rash appears until all chickenpox blisters have crusted over. Once someone has had a chickenpox infection, he or she almost always develops a lifelong immunity, meaning that person usually does not get chickenpox a second time.\nChickenpox is very contagious, and spreads easily with household or other close contact among people who are not immune. In the past, chickenpox cases often occurred in groups (epidemics), usually during the late winter and early spring. However, the number of cases of chickenpox has dropped dramatically because of the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine, which was licensed in 1995 and is recommended for all children.\nChickenpox is an uncomfortable infection that, in most cases, goes away by itself. However, chickenpox also has been associated with serious complications, including death. About one of every 100 children infected with chickenpox will develop a severe lung infection (pneumonia), an infection of the brain (encephalitis), or a problem with the liver. Dangerous skin infections also can occur.\nBefore the introduction of the vaccine, about 100,000 people were hospitalized and 100 people in the United States died each year of chickenpox, most of them previously healthy children. Adolescents and adults who develop chickenpox are also at high risk of developing serious complications.\nAfter a person has chickenpox, the virus typically lives silently in the nervous system of the body for the rest of a person's life. It may reactivate (come to life again) at any time. This is more likely to happen when the body's immune defenses are weakened by stress or illness (such as cancer or HIV infection) or by medications that weaken the immune system. The most common reason for the virus to reactivate is getting older.\nReactivation of the virus causes a condition called herpes zoster, commonly known a shingles. It's a painful blistering skin rash that typically occurs on the face, chest or back, in the same area where one or two of the body's sensory nerves travel.\n",
      "Symptoms of chickenpox": "Symptoms of chickenpox begin between 10 and 21 days after a person is exposed. The illness typically includes fever and a generally sick feeling. This is soon followed by itchy, red bumps that quickly become fluid-filled and are easily recognized as chickenpox. The rash usually begins on the head, face and trunk and moves outward to the arms and legs.\nThese skin blisters are round, about 5 millimeters to 10 millimeters across (about the size of a pencil eraser), with a red base. Sometimes, they are described as a \"dew drop on a rose petal.\" They appear in various stages over the next few days and eventually crust over. These blisters may appear anywhere there is skin, even inside the mouth, throat or vagina. Some patients have only 50 blisters or fewer. Others have too many to count.\n",
      "Diagnosing chickenpox": "If you or someone in your household develops a skin rash suggestive of chicken pox, call your doctor. He or she may suspect chickenpox over the phone, especially if that person has not had the chickenpox vaccine or the chickenpox disease before.\nYour doctor will most likely want to examine you. Be sure to ask the doctor's staff about where you should enter the office to avoid exposing other patients.\nYour doctor will want to know whether you have been exposed to someone with chickenpox, although this is not necessary to make the diagnosis. He or she can most often make the diagnosis based on your symptoms and the typical appearance of the skin rash.\nDiagnostic blood tests are also available, but they do not need to be done in most patients. Sometimes your physician may scrape a chickenpox blister to examine it under the microscope.\n",
      "Expected duration of chickenpox": "Chickenpox blisters form over a period of 3 to 5 days and then crust over during the next 7 to 10 days.\n",
      "Preventing chickenpox": "Chickenpox once was considered to be an unavoidable childhood illness, meaning everyone would get it. However, since the varicella vaccine was licensed, this disease can be prevented easily.\nThe standard recommendation is to give the first dose of varicella vaccine between age 12 and 15 months and again when the child is 3- 4 years old, but the second dose can be given as soon as three months after the first. The vaccine also is recommended when someone who has never had the disease or vaccine before has been exposed to someone with active chickenpox. This may help to prevent that person from getting the disease.\nSome people are at high risk of serious complications from chickenpox, including people who have problems with their immune system, certain pregnant women, and premature infants. If a person at high risk is exposed to someone with chickenpox, an injection of varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) also may help to prevent chickenpox. VZIG contains protective antibodies against chickenpox that are taken from the blood of healthy people who have high levels of protection against the chickenpox virus. However, VZIG rarely is given unless a person at risk of serious complications has been exposed to someone with chickenpox for more than one hour.\n",
      "Treating chickenpox": "Doctors can use an antiviral medication such acyclovir (Zovirax) or valacyclovir (Valtrex) to help minimize the symptoms of chickenpox in adults. It is most effective if it is started within the first 24 hours after the onset of the rash. Any parent without a personal history of chickenpox whose child develops chickenpox should call his or her own doctor right away to see whether treatment is recommended.\nOtherwise healthy children who get chickenpox do not usually need antiviral medication.\nMost of the treatment for chickenpox focuses on relieving the annoying itch of chickenpox blisters and preventing broken blisters from getting infected from scratching. Oatmeal baths and calamine lotion can help to reduce the itchiness. Trim fingernails to decrease the risk of infection and scarring from scratching.\nIf itchiness cannot be controlled with baths and lotion, oral (taken by mouth) antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl and other brand names), may give some relief. Use a non-aspirin medication such as acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brand names) to lower your child's fever. Never give aspirin to a child with chickenpox because it can cause Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal illness. Sometimes, chickenpox blisters can become infected with bacteria and require antibiotic treatment.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if any child or adult in your family develops symptoms of chickenpox, especially if:\nCall your doctor for his or her recommendations if you or your child has been exposed to chickenpox and neither of you has had the disease or the vaccine before.\nIn people with confirmed chickenpox, call your doctor if any of the following symptoms develops:\nTo decrease the spread of chickenpox, the person with chickenpox should avoid exposing people who have not had the disease, especially those who cannot fight infection well.\nIf you or your children (aged 1 year and older) have never had chickenpox, ask your doctor about the chickenpox vaccine. If you are a woman who has never had chickenpox and you are considering becoming pregnant, speak with your doctor immediately about reducing your risk of chickenpox and other preventable infections before you become pregnant.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In otherwise healthy children, chickenpox is usually a mild infection, with the skin returning to normal within two to four weeks. Sometimes, a few mild scars remain where some of the chickenpox rash had been. Scratching the blisters can result in more noticeable scars. Remember that in a very small number of cases, chickenpox causes more serious infections that require hospitalization and sometimes cause long-term disability and death.\n",

      "What is chlamydia?": "Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection spread by having unprotected sex with someone infected with bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. These bacteria are found in the urine and genital secretions of infected people. Chlamydia can affect several areas of the reproductive system, causing urethritis, vaginitis, cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Chlamydia also can cause eye infections and pneumonia in newborns delivered by mothers who have chlamydia.\nChlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. Infections occur most often in unmarried people under age 25 who have had two or more sex partners during the previous year. In women, chlamydia that is not treated can lead to infertility, chronic pelvic pain and tubal pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg implants and grows in the fallopian tube, rather than the uterus.\n",
      "Symptoms of chlamydia": "About 75% of women and 50% of men with chlamydia have no symptoms. This is why many infected people remain untreated and can continue to spread the infection to others.\nIn women, chlamydia can cause:\nIn men, chlamydia can cause:\n",
      "Diagnosing chlamydia": "Because chlamydia may not cause any symptoms, your doctor will gauge your risk of having the infection based on your sexual history. For example, your doctor will ask if you have had sex without using condoms. Your doctor can confirm whether you have chlamydia by using a urine test or a swab to collect fluid from the urethra or cervix. If you are at risk of chlamydia, you should be tested at least once a year, even if you have no symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration of chlamydia": "If untreated, chlamydia can last for many months, and during this time, bacteria can be spread to others through unprotected sex.\n",
      "Preventing chlamydia": "Because chlamydia is a disease that can be spread during sexual intercourse, you can prevent chlamydia by:\nTo prevent complications of untreated chlamydia, including infertility and tubal pregnancy, sexually active women at risk of chlamydia should have a routine pelvic examination with a chlamydia-screening test every year. To prevent chlamydia eye infections and pneumonia in newborns, pregnant women at risk of chlamydia should be screened.\n",
      "Treating chlamydia": "Doctors treat chlamydia with oral antibiotics such as doxycycline (Vibramycin), azithromycin (Zithromax) and levofloxacin (Levaquin). Everyone being treated for chlamydia should have all of his or her sex partners treated as well.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force strongly recommends the following groups of women receive yearly chlamydia screening:\nCall your health care professional if you have had sexual contact with someone you think has been infected with chlamydia.\nCall your doctor if you have symptoms of urethral, vaginal or pelvic infection.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Antibiotic treatment cures chlamydia and can usually prevent complications. Once a woman develops pelvic inflammatory disease from chlamydia or another cause, she has up to 20% risk of a long-term complication such as infertility or chronic pelvic pain.\n",

      "What is cholecystitis?": "Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is the small sac-like organ located in the upper right side of the abdomen, just below the liver. It is attached to the main duct that carries bile from the liver into the intestine. The gallbladder temporarily stores bile, which is a liquid that contains a fat-digesting substance produced in the liver. During a meal, the gallbladder contracts, and bile moves from the gallbladder through small, tube-like passages (called the cystic duct and the common bile duct) into the small intestine. Here, bile mixes with food to help break down fats.\nCholecystitis usually develops when a person has gallstones, which are rock-like deposits that form inside the gallbladder. If a gallstone blocks the cystic duct (the outflow from the gallbladder), bile becomes trapped in the gallbladder. Chemicals in the trapped bile or a bacterial infection can then lead to inflammation of the gallbladder.\nThere are two types of cholecystitis:\nGallstones alone can cause episodes of crampy abdominal pain without any infection. This is called biliary colic.\nWomen are more likely than men to get gallstones. The risk of gallstones also is higher in:\n",
      "Symptoms of cholecystitis": "Symptoms ofacute cholecystitismay include:\nWhen gallstones in the common bile duct block the flow of bile from the liver to the intestine, the patient may develop a serious infection of the bile ducts called cholangitis. The typical symptoms of cholangitis are fever, right upper abdominal pain, and jaundice. Another possible problem that may occur when gallstones pass into the common bile duct is acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). Because the duct from the pancreas also flows into the common bile duct, stones there can block the pancreas, which causes it to become inflamed. Like cholangitis, acute pancreatitis can be serious.\nThe major symptom ofchronic cholecystitisis usually intermittent pain. However, some people do not have any symptoms. If there is pain, it is usually mild, and comes and goes. These rather nonspecific symptoms accompany many other illnesses, so you may not be diagnosed with chronic cholecystitis until you have an episode of more severe symptoms during a sudden attack.\n",
      "Diagnosing cholecystitis": "Your doctor will review your medical history and ask about any prior episodes of abdominal discomfort, especially those triggered by high-fat meals. Your doctor will ask if you've had any recent rapid weight loss and about medications you currently take, particularly birth control pills and estrogen replacement therapy (because these can lead to the formation of gallstones).\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will pay particular attention to the upper right portion of your abdomen, where your liver and gallbladder are located. Blood tests may reveal an elevated white blood cell count, which suggests an infection, or elevated liver enzymes, which suggests a blockage and/or irritation of the gallbladder and bile ducts.\nYour doctor may order radiology tests to look for gallstones. Because the chemical composition of most gallstones often makes them invisible on X-rays, other tests are also used, including:\n",
      "Expected duration of cholecystitis": "If you have biliary colic, the pain or discomfort may go away or become less severe after several hours if a trapped gallstone passes out of the cystic duct on its own. Your abdomen may continue to ache mildly for about 24 hours.\nIf you haveacute cholecystitis, however, and infection and inflammation continue, your symptoms may get worse and you could develop complications, including a hole in the inflamed gallbladder wall (gallbladder perforation) and an infection that spreads to the lining of the abdomen (peritonitis). This is why people with cholecystitis usually are treated and observed in a hospital until their symptoms improve.\nSymptoms ofchronic cholecystitismay be present for years before a diagnosis is made. Surgery to remove the gallbladder will prevent symptoms from coming back.\n",
      "Preventing cholecystitis": "Because gallstones cause cholecystitis, you may be able to avoid cholecystitis by controlling the risk factors that can lead to the formation of gallstones. These include watching your weight and avoiding a high-fat diet.\n",
      "Treating cholecystitis": "Acute cholecystitisusually requires hospitalization. You need antibiotics given intravenously (into a vein) to treat infection, and medications to control symptoms of nausea and abdominal pain. Once your pain lessens or goes away, there are no signs of infection, and you are able to drink and eat, you will be able to go home to continue your recovery. Alternatively, your doctor may wish you to stay in the hospital until you have surgery to remove your gallbladder.\nTwenty-five percent of people who have acute cholecystitis develop another episode within 1 year; 60% have another episode within 6 years. For this reason, most doctors recommend that people with cholecystitis have the gallbladder removed surgically (cholecystectomy). Sometimes, surgery is scheduled after a person has been discharged from the hospital and has recovered fully. In some cases, your surgeon may decide to do the cholecystectomy before you leave the hospital.\nChronic cholecystitisrequires the removal of the gallbladder surgically.\nGallstones in the Common Bile Ductshould be removed, to prevent blockage to the flow of bile, and possible cholangitis or pancreatitis. Usually this can be done using a special flexible telescope that is passed down the mouth, through the stomach, and to the opening where the bile duct empties into the intestine. The opening is widened by cutting it slightly, and the stones are then extracted with instruments passed through the telescope. This is called \"endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\" (andquot;ERCP\"). After the stones are removed with ERCP, your doctor may recommend that you have surgery later, to remove your gallbladder (where the stones usually originate). Occasionally, ERCP is not possible, and abdominal surgery is required to remove stones in the bile duct.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have severe abdominal pain, fever and shaking chills, or jaundice.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people recover from episodes of acute cholecystitis within a few days to a few weeks. Rarely, a person can become critically ill from a complication, such as gallbladder perforation, cholangitis or pancreatitis and in rare cases the condition can be fatal.\nRemoving the gallbladder prevents cholecystitis from coming back. Rarely, gallstones may remain hidden in bile ducts to cause other problems after surgery.\n",

      "What is chorionic villus sampling?": "Chorionic villi are small branching structures on one side of the placenta. They anchor the placenta to the wall of the uterus, almost like the roots of a plant. They have another rootlike function, which is to absorb nutrients from the mother's blood in the lining of her uterus, and to deliver these to the umbilical cord. These structures contain cells from the developing fetus. A test that removes a sample of these cells through a needle is called chorionic villus sampling (CVS).\nCVS answers many of the same questions as amniocentesis about diseases that the baby might have. Diseases that can be diagnosed with CVS include Tay-Sachs, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, thalassemia, and Down syndrome. (Rh incompatibility and neural tube defects, however, can be diagnosed only through amniocentesis.) CVS can be done earlier in pregnancy than amniocentesis, and can be done when there is not enough amniotic fluid to allow amniocentesis. However, it has some extra risks when compared with amniocentesis.\n",
      "How do I prepare for chorionic villus sampling?": "CVS can be done between the 10th and 13th weeks of pregnancy. Tell your doctor ahead of time if you have ever had an allergic reaction to lidocaine or the numbing medicine used at the dentist's office.\n",
      "What happens when chorionic villus sampling is performed?": "There are two ways that your doctor can perform CVS. Some patients have the sampling done through the vagina and cervix. Other patients have the sampling done through the abdominal wall. For both types of sampling, you lie on your back on an examination table and the doctor uses ultrasound to locate the fetus and the placenta.\nIf the sampling is to be done through the vagina and cervix, you place your feet in footrests and bend your knees up, as you would for a pelvic examination. A speculum (a device that looks like a duck-bill that can be opened and closed) is used to open the vagina so that your doctor can see inside. A long flexible tube, much narrower than a straw, is inserted through the cervix and moved forward while your doctor watches on the ultrasound until it is next to the fetal side of the placenta. A small sample of the lining around the fetus is then pulled into the tube for testing.\nIf the sampling is to be done through the abdominal wall, your lower abdomen is cleaned with an antibacterial soap. In some cases, the doctor uses a small needle to inject a numbing medicine just under the skin, so that you do not feel the sampling needle. (Because the sampling needle does not cause much more stinging than the numbing medicine itself, not every doctor includes this step.) A hollow needle several inches long is inserted through the skin and muscle of the abdomen and through the wall of the uterus, to the edge of the placenta. This needle is held in place as a guide needle. A narrower needle is then inserted through the first needle. It is rotated and moved inward and outward a number of times. A sample is collected into an attached syringe.\nThe fetal heart tones and the mother's blood pressure and heart rate are checked at the beginning and end of the procedure. The whole procedure takes close to 30 minutes.\n",
      "What risks are there from chorionic villus sampling?": "The risk of miscarriage and other complications from CVS is slightly higher than the risk from amniocentesis, although some parents feel that it is worth the extra risk to be able to make decisions earlier in the pregnancy if the results show the baby has a health problem. There have also been some reports that suggest there is a very small risk of birth defects (abnormal limbs) in the fetus.\nOne particular difficulty with this test is that it can have a falsely abnormal result due to variability in the cells of the placenta. This variability is called mosaicism. Mosaicism occasionally causes an abnormal test result even if the baby is normal and healthy. This might lead you to make decisions about pregnancy termination that you would not have made if you had better information. Some doctors may recommend another test, amniocentesis, to confirm an abnormal result before a termination is planned.\nSome women have vaginal bleeding after the procedure. Infection is uncommon.\n",
      "Must I do anything special after the test is over?": "You should notify your doctor if you are having vaginal bleeding, especially if it is heavy or lasts longer than three days. You should also tell your doctor about strong abdominal pain or fever. Doctors usually recommend avoiding exercise and sex on the day you have the procedure.\n",
      "How long is it before the result of the test is known?": "A complete chromosome analysis of the sample may take two weeks or more. The results of some tests may be available sooner.\n",

      "What is chronic fatigue syndrome?": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complicated illness characterized by at least six months of extreme fatigue that is not relieved by rest, and a group of additional symptoms that also are constant for at least six months. In many people with chronic fatigue syndrome, the disorder begins suddenly, often following a flulike infection or an episode of physical or psychological trauma, such as surgery, a traumatic accident or the death of a loved one. In other cases, chronic fatigue syndrome develops gradually. The illness lasts for many months or years, and only a small percentage of people recover full health.\nMany people feel tired a lot of the time, and many seek help from their doctors. Most people who experience chronic (long-lasting) fatigue are not suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome. Depression and overwork are much more common causes of chronic fatigue.\nThe exact cause of chronic fatigue syndrome remains a mystery. The illness can follow a number of common infectious illnesses, such as Lyme disease or infectious mononucleosis, but not all cases are tied to infections. Testing has found that people with chronic fatigue syndrome have abnormalities in the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus (a part of the brain that regulates hormones and vital functions) and the pituitary gland.\nTesting also has found that patients have abnormalities in the part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, which controls blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and other vital body functions. For example, many patients with chronic fatigue syndrome have an unusually high heart rate and low blood pressure when they have been standing for a while.\nSeveral parts of the immune system remain activated for long periods in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. There is growing evidence that some patients with chronic fatigue syndrome have an autoimmune condition: their immune system is attacking particular tissues in the body.\nPatients with chronic fatigue syndrome have defects in the ability of cells in their bodies to make energy. Some studies indicate that certain genes are built differently, and that the activity of genes in white blood cells is different, in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.\nMany different tests of the brain, and of the autonomic nervous system, reveal abnormalities that are not seen in healthy people of the same age, or in people with other conditions that can cause fatigue, such as depression.\nMany of the abnormalities of the immune system, energy metabolism, and the nervous system seem to come and go. Furthermore, not all of the abnormalities affect every patient with chronic fatigue syndrome.\nIn the United States, federal health authorities estimate that chronic fatigue syndrome affects 1 to 8 of every 1,000 Americans older than age 18. Women are affected about three times as often as men. Although the illness is most common in people 25 to 45 years old, chronic fatigue syndrome can attack people of all age groups, including children. The condition also is found in people of all racial, ethnic and economic backgrounds. It appears to be more common in African-Americans and Latinos, and in people in lower socioeconomic groups. It appears to be less common in Asian-Americans. Studies from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other research groups estimate that the United States loses as much as $25 billion each year in reduced productivity and medical expenses due to chronic fatigue syndrome.\nAlthough most cases of chronic fatigue syndrome do not occur during epidemics, at least 30 outbreaks of chronic fatigue syndrome have been reported, during which many people in the same area suddenly developed the illness at the same time. However, health experts have failed to identify a cause for their chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms.\nMany people infected with the SARS Co-V2 virus that causes COVID-19 have developed long-lasting symptoms, including symptoms consistent with ME/CFS.\n",
      "Symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome": "The most prominent symptom of ME/CFS is an unexplained feeling of fatigue, which is not relieved by rest. However, many other medical conditions cause marked fatigue.\nTo better identify people with ME/CFS, diagnostic criteria should include these four types of symptoms:\nMany people with ME/CFS also experience additional symptoms, including:\n",
      "Diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome": "Although there is a lot of evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome is caused by a physical problem involving the immune system, energy metabolism and the nervous system, there is no laboratory test or procedure to confirm the diagnosis. Today, the diagnosis of ME/CFS is based on the presence of the four major symptoms noted above.\nYour doctor will also want to consider other possible reasons for your symptoms, such as:\nYour doctor will examine you and likely order some basic blood tests, such as a red blood cell count (hematocrit), white blood cell count and differential white blood cell count, thyroid, kidney and liver tests. Additional, more specialized testing may be needed, including testing of your autonomic nervous system.\n",
      "Expected duration of chronic fatigue syndrome": "To be diagnosed as ME/CFS, symptoms must last for at least six months. Unfortunately, in many people, symptoms persist for years. Symptoms tend to be worse in the first one to two years, and level of functioning gradually improving over time. However, only a small percentage of people recover to full health.\n",
      "Preventing chronic fatigue syndrome": "There are no specific actions a person can take to prevent ME/CFS.\n",
      "Treating chronic fatigue syndrome": "There is no FDA proven treatment for ME/CFS. However, clinician acknowledgement of the patient’s condition as ME/CFS and symptom guided approaches can improve quality of life.\nIn general, doctors use a combination of the following:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, especially if extreme fatigue prevents you from fully participating in activities at home, work or school.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People with ME/CFS usually experience their most severe symptoms in the first one to two years of illness. After that time, a small number of people recover totally, and a smaller number become totally incapacitated. For most people, there is gradual improvement, although they usually do not achieve the level of activity they were capable of before becoming ill. Recovery tends to be less likely among people who:\n",

      "What is chronic hepatitis?": "Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. In chronic hepatitis, liver inflammation continues for at least six months. This condition may be mild, causing relatively little damage, or more serious, causing many liver cells to be destroyed. Some cases lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.\nChronic hepatitis from infection is most often caused by these viruses:\nHepatitis B and C.Often the person infected is unaware of any initial symptoms. Or the symptoms were so mild that the person did not seek medical attention. This is especially true for chronic hepatitis C. Over time, perhaps a decade or more, both types may lead to the serious complication of cirrhosis due to ongoing destruction of liver cells and resultant scarring. A minority of patients with cirrhosis develop liver cancer over time.\nHepatitis D.Hepatitis D infects only patients already infected with hepatitis B, and it generally results in a flare of active hepatitis.\nThe three more commonly diagnosed causes of non-infectious chronic hepatitis include:\nAlcohol.Alcohol can cause a chronic hepatitis, especially if associated with inadequate nutrition. Also, even moderate intake of alcohol can make chronic hepatitis from any other cause (especially hepatitis C) worse, with an increased risk of advancing to cirrhosis.\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH has become a relatively common cause of persistent liver inflammation. \"Steato\" means fat and the hallmark of NASH is fat in the liver AND active on-going liver damage. Most people have no symptoms. They are usually discovered when a routine blood test is performed and the level of liver enzymes are found to be above normal.\nAutoimmune hepatitis.In this form of chronic hepatitis, the immune system mistakenly destroys the body's own liver cells. What triggers autoimmune chronic hepatitis is unknown. If left untreated, it's a progressive disease that can lead to cirrhosis. It may appear with other autoimmune diseases, such as Sjögren's syndrome and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Autoimmune hepatitis most often is found in young women, but it can affect women and men of all ages.\nSome rare, inherited metabolic disorders also can lead to chronic hepatitis, such as:\nSome medications also can lead to chronic hepatitis. However, chronic hepatitis caused by medications is relatively uncommon. Periodic blood tests are warranted when patients are placed on drugs known to cause hepatitis. Discontinuing the medication usually reverses early liver inflammation.\n",
      "Symptoms of chronic hepatitis": "At first, chronic hepatitis often does not cause any symptoms. People with symptoms most commonly complain of fatigue. Fatigue worsens throughout the day and may even be debilitating. Other common symptoms include:\nIf chronic hepatitis becomes more severe, people may experience additional symptoms, including:\n",
      "Diagnosing chronic hepatitis": "Because chronic hepatitis often does not cause any early symptoms, the disorder frequently is discovered during a routine blood test.\nIf your doctor suspects you may have chronic hepatitis, he or she may examine you for jaundice, tenderness in the abdomen (especially the right upper corner where the liver is located) and signs of fluid that fills the abdomen during liver failure.\nBlood tests may be done to measure:\nIf these tests show signs of liver inflammation, you will undergo blood tests for hepatitis B and C and for antibodies that signal autoimmune hepatitis. Your doctor will review medications you take now or have taken recently to determine if they could be causing your chronic hepatitis. If the cause still is not known, further blood tests will be ordered to check for uncommon causes. An ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) test may be done to assess the size of the liver. A small liver that appears scarred suggests cirrhosis.\nA liver biopsy may be recommended. In a biopsy, a small piece of tissue will be removed from your liver and will be examined under a microscope to help determine:\nThis information helps to determine the best treatment and to assess your risk of developing cirrhosis and liver failure. A liver biopsy also can help to check for other disorders, such as alcoholic liver injury or fatty liver.\n",
      "Expected duration of chronic hepatitis": "By definition, chronic hepatitis is inflammation that continues for more than six months. With mild or nonexistent symptoms, you may have chronic hepatitis for some time before it is discovered. Treatment for some types of viral chronic hepatitis can eliminate active infection. However, the virus can remain dormant in cells, so the condition can return.\n",
      "Preventing chronic hepatitis": "Until recently, most cases of chronic hepatitis were caused by infection with the hepatitis B or C virus. These viruses primarily are passed from person to person through sexual contact or through contact with blood or other bodily fluids when needles are shared or during blood transfusions. The reason some cases of viral hepatitis become chronic hepatitis and others do not remains unknown.\nThe best way to protect against chronic hepatitis from hepatitis B and C viruses is vaccination. Vaccinations for hepatitis B are recommended for health care workers, people traveling to certain countries and those who are concerned about acquiring hepatitis B through sexual contact or drug use. Infants are now routinely vaccinated against hepatitis B. Condoms always should be used during sexual contact to help prevent infection. Needles should never be shared. When getting a tattoo or any body piercing done, make sure to choose an establishment where all equipment is sterilized adequately.\nBecause of effective therapy to eradicate hepatitis C and improved therapies for hepatitis B, persistent liver inflammation due to fatty liver is now the more cause of chronic hepatitis in developed countries. Non-alcoholic liver disease with inflammation is called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen most often in people who are overweight, especially if they accumulate excessive fat around the midsection. Women with waist size 35 inches or greater and men with waist size 40 inches or greater are at highest risk of developing this type of chronic hepatitis. Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly give you the best chance of preventing NASH. Avoiding and even better eliminating alcohol use helps prevent both NASH and alcoholic hepatitis.\nIf you are taking a medication that could affect your liver, make sure to have your blood tested regularly to avoid the development of chronic hepatitis or liver damage.\n",
      "Treating chronic hepatitis": "The goals of treatment for chronic hepatitis are to prevent the disease from getting worse and to prevent cirrhosis and liver failure.\nChronic hepatitis B and C are treated with antiviral medications. The newest drugs have incredibly high success rates.\nIf you have hepatitis C, you should receive the vaccine for hepatitis A and B unless blood tests show that you are already immune to these viruses. You can develop more severe symptoms from hepatitis A or B than someone who does not have hepatitis C.\nTreatment of alcoholic hepatitis is complete abstinence from alcohol.\nPeople with NASH usually need to lose weight and always need to exercise more. In addition, many people with NASH have elevated blood sugars and frequently progress to type 2 diabetes. Good control of blood sugar can help to decrease the fatty accumulation and inflammation in the liver.\nIf you already have evidence of cirrhosis, you should have a test called endoscopy to look for esophageal varices, enlarged veins in the esophagus that can cause life-threatening bleeding. In an endoscopy, a flexible viewing tube is inserted through your mouth into your esophagus. You also should be screened periodically with a blood test (alpha fetoprotein) and an ultrasound study to search for an early liver cancer.\nCorticosteroids and other medications such as azathioprine to suppress the immune system are the main treatment of autoimmune chronic hepatitis. These drugs usually decrease symptoms, reduce liver inflammation and prolong survival.\nTreatment for the less common forms of chronic hepatitis focuses on the disease that is causing the condition. Medication-related chronic hepatitis requires stopping or changing the drug.\nIf cirrhosis or liver failure develops, a liver transplant may be needed.\nIf you have chronic hepatitis, you must avoid further liver damage from alcohol or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Discuss with your doctor how much acetaminophen you can take, if any. Remember that certain cold formulations and pain medications also contain acetaminophen.\nA healthy lifestyle is so important for people with chronic hepatitis. A well-balanced diet and good physical fitness can help you battle fatigue and improve overall health. You may need to limit your salt intake if you tend to accumulate fluid as a consequence of cirrhosis. Also, always talk to your physician before taking any additional drugs, including prescription, nonprescription and alternative medications. Your injured liver may not be able to detoxify these.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience persistent fatigue, the most common symptom of chronic hepatitis, make an appointment to see your doctor. If you show signs that could come from chronic hepatitis or liver failure, such as jaundice, abdominal swelling or weight loss, you should call your doctor for an evaluation.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis for chronic hepatitis has improved dramatically over the last few years. In fact, for hepatitis C, many people can now be cured.\nDespite treatment, some people will progress to cirrhosis. Advanced cirrhosis can lead to liver failure and death unless a liver transplant can be done.\nThe likelihood of developing cirrhosis depends on the severity of the disease and the response to treatment. When a biopsy shows more severe damage, treatment can be important to help decrease the risk of developing cirrhosis even if you do not have symptoms. Other factors that affect the prognosis include age, other medical illnesses, the subtype of virus and alcohol use.\nCirrhosis increases the risk of developing liver cancer. Periodic screening with a blood test and ultrasound examination of the liver improves the chance of early detection.\n",

      "What is chronic laryngitis?": "Laryngitis is an inflammation of the larynx, the \"voice box\" that contains the vocal cords in the upper portion of the neck. Laryngitis occurs in two forms, acute and chronic. Acute laryngitis typically is a brief illness producing hoarseness and a sore throat. In most cases, an upper respiratory tract infection causes it. Chronic laryngitis is a more persistent disorder that produces lingering hoarseness and other voice changes. It usually is painless and has no significant sign of infection.\n\nAmong adults, the most common causes of chronic laryngitis are:\nLess often, chronic laryngitis can be caused by chronic sinusitis with postnasal drip. Rarely, it can be caused by an inflammatory illness or infection directly involving the vocal cords (such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis).\n",
      "Symptoms of chronic laryngitis": "The most common symptom of chronic laryngitis is hoarseness. For the condition to be truly chronic, this hoarseness must persist for at least two weeks. Depending on the cause of chronic laryngitis, other symptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing chronic laryngitis": "After reviewing your symptoms, your doctor will ask you about your lifestyle, especially:\nYour doctor will want to know the names of all prescription and nonprescription medications you take because some medications have side effects that can mimic the symptoms of chronic laryngitis. For example, hoarseness due to excessive dryness of the throat can be a side effect of certain antihistamines, cough suppressants, diuretics and psychiatric medications. Decongestants or medications for high blood pressure (hypertension) can cause mucus in the throat to thicken.\nYour doctor will examine you, paying special attention to your mouth, throat, nose, ears and the lymph nodes in your neck. Using a special mirror, your doctor will look down your throat and examine your larynx. This exam may be followed by a procedure called laryngoscopy, a more sophisticated method of looking at the larynx using straight or flexible tube-like instruments. If your doctor suspects that you have GERD, additional tests can check for acid reflux in your throat and esophagus.\n",
      "Expected duration of chronic laryngitis": "For laryngitis to be truly chronic, hoarseness must last for at least two weeks. Once chronic laryngitis develops, it is usually a long-term problem in people who continue to smoke, drink alcohol heavily, work with irritating dusts or chemicals, or abuse the voice by shouting or constant talking. Chronic laryngitis caused by GERD will last as long as acid reflux continues.\n",
      "Preventing chronic laryngitis": "You can take these steps to help prevent chronic laryngitis:\n",
      "Treating chronic laryngitis": "If your chronic laryngitis is due to smoking, alcohol use, work-related exposures or voice overuse, your doctor will probably recommend that you follow the standard prevention guidelines. In addition, your doctor may refer you to a voice coach or a speech-language pathologist for voice therapy. Voice therapy teaches you to use your voice correctly and to avoid speaking in ways that might injure your vocal cords.\nIf you have chronic laryngitis due to GERD, your doctor may recommend that you try the following:\nIf these strategies do not help, your doctor may prescribe medications to decrease acid production in your stomach.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Hoarseness that doesn't go away or keeps coming back should never be ignored because it also can be a symptom of certain head and neck cancers. People who drink or smoke heavily are at especially high risk of these cancers. So, if hoarseness lasts more than two weeks, make an appointment to see your doctor. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist (an otolaryngologist, also called an ear, nose and throat doctor) for evaluation and treatment.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If you are willing to make lifestyle changes to treat your chronic laryngitis, the outlook is usually very good. This is especially true for people whose chronic laryngitis is related to smoking, alcohol, work exposure or voice abuse. For people with GERD, a combination of dietary changes and medications to decrease acid production can cure chronic laryngitis in up to two-thirds of cases.\nOn the other hand, if you have chronic laryngitis and you continue to expose yourself to factors that irritate your larynx, you eventually can develop small nodules or polyps (fingerlike growths) on your vocal cords, which may need to be removed surgically to improve your voice.\n",

      "What is chronic otitis media?": "Chronic otitis media describes some long-term problems with the middle ear, such as a hole (perforation) in the eardrum that does not heal, or a middle-ear infection (otitis media) that doesn't improve or keeps returning.\nThe middle ear is a small bony chamber with three tiny bones — the malleus, incus, and stapes — covered by the eardrum (tympanic membrane). Sound is passed from the eardrum through the middle-ear bones to the inner ear, where the nerve impulses for hearing are created. The middle ear is connected to the back of the nose and throat by the eustachian tube, a narrow passage that helps to control the air flow and pressure inside the middle ear. The middle ear can become inflamed or infected when the eustachian tube becomes blocked, for example, when someone has a cold or allergies. When fluid remains in the middle ear, the condition is called chronic serous otitis media.\n\nSometimes a middle-ear infection causes a hole (perforation) in the eardrum. A hole that does not heal within six weeks is called chronic otitis media. This problem can take one of three forms:\n\nChildren are more likely to get middle-ear infections. Because of this, they also are more likely to develop chronic otitis media. Doctors believe that children have an especially high risk of all types of ear infections because of several factors, including:\nProblems with the middle ear, such as fluid in the middle ear, a hole in the eardrum, or injury to the small middle-ear bones, can cause hearing loss. In rare situations, infections in the middle ear can spread deeper inside the inner ear, causing a sensorineural hearing loss and dizziness. Rare, but serious, complications include brain infections, such as an abscess or meningitis. A chronic infection and a cholesteatoma also can cause injury to the facial nerves and facial paralysis.\n",
      "Symptoms of chronic otitis media": "A person can have chronic otitis media caused by a persistent hole in the eardrum for years with no symptoms or only mild hearing loss. There may be mild ear pain or discomfort. When the middle ear is infected, fluid will drain from the ear and hearing loss can worsen.\nSymptoms that can be a sign of a more serious condition, and that require immediate attention, include\n",
      "Diagnosing chronic otitis media": "The doctor will ask about a history of ear infections, treatments used, and any previous ear surgery. The doctor also will want to know about any medications being taken to treat an ear problem, including the type, dose, and length of treatment.\nThe doctor may suspect chronic otitis media based on a history of prior ear infections, persistent ear drainage, or both. To confirm the diagnosis, he or she will look inside the ear with a special light called an otoscope and may take a sample of drainage fluid to be examined in a laboratory.\nIn some cases, the primary care doctor may refer you or your child to an otolaryngologist, a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the ears, nose, and throat. If the otolaryngologist suspects mastoiditis or a cholesteatoma, additional tests may be needed. These could include x-rays, a computed tomography (CT) scan, or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. If there is any concern that hearing may have been affected, it can be evaluated by a test called an audiogram.\n",
      "Expected duration of chronic otitis media": "How long symptoms last varies. Antibiotic treatment of the infection causing the chronic otitis media may be enough to stop the ear from draining. Sometimes, despite appropriate antibiotics, the infection continues, and surgery may be needed to remove the infected tissue and repair the eardrum perforation and any injury to the tiny bones in the ear.\n",
      "Preventing chronic otitis media": "One of the best ways to prevent chronic otitis media is to have any ear infection treated promptly. A child with chronic eustachian tube problems may need special tubes (tympanostomy tubes) inserted into his or her eardrums to prevent repeated ear infections by allowing air to flow normally in the middle ear.\nAfter an infection clears up, a perforated eardrum may need to be repaired to prevent another infection.\n",
      "Treating chronic otitis media": "The goals of chronic otitis media treatment include\nIn many case, topical antibiotics are tried first. Most often, doctors choose a fluoroquinolone antibiotic solution, such as ciprofloxacin. For more severe infections, an oral antibiotic will be needed.\nAlso, the doctor will suction out the middle-ear fluid that is draining. Most infections will clear up with this treatment unless a cholesteatoma is present. A cholesteatoma can cause repeated infections and often must be removed with surgery.\nA doctor may recommend surgery to repair a persistent hole in the eardrum. However, in some cases, the hole is left open because it can act like a tympanostomy tube to allow air to flow through the middle ear and possibly prevent more infections.\nWhen a chronic ear infection spreads beyond the middle ear to the mastoid bone (the portion of bone behind the middle ear), a serious infection called mastoiditis can occur. Antibiotics given intravenously (into a vein) often can clear up this infection, but surgery may be necessary.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you or your child develops a cloudy or foul-smelling discharge from one or both ears or has difficulty hearing. Also, seek emergency care for fever, swelling, tenderness, or redness behind the ear, persistent or severe ear pain, dizziness, headache, confusion, or facial weakness.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With prompt antibiotic treatment and ear aspiration, the outlook is excellent. About nine out of 10 patients are free of infection after this therapy. Surgery is not required in most cases, but may be necessary to correct a persistent eardrum perforation or to remove a cholesteatoma. After this surgery, the infection almost always goes away. Whether full hearing returns depends on the extent of damage and how well the ear heals after surgery.\n",

      "What is it?": "Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, a gland located behind the stomach. People with chronic pancreatitis have persistent inflammation of the pancreas that leads to permanent damage.\n\nThe main function of the pancreas is to produce digestive enzymes and hormones, such as insulin, that regulate blood sugar levels. Damage to the pancreas can cause problems with digestion, absorption of nutrients, and production of insulin. As a result, people with chronic pancreatitis can lose weight, experience diarrhea, become malnourished with vitamin deficiencies, and develop diabetes.\nIt usually takes several years for permanent changes and symptoms to occur. Most cases of chronic pancreatitis are caused by long-standing overuse of alcohol. Since only a small percentage of people who overuse alcohol develop chronic pancreatitis, there probably are other factors that influence whether someone develops chronic pancreatitis. It is generally thought that people who continue to drink after one or more bouts of alcohol-related acute pancreatitis are more likely to develop chronic pancreatitis.\nIn some uncommon cases, a single severe episode of acute pancreatitis can cause enough damage that the disease becomes chronic.\nBesides overuse of alcohol, other causes of chronic pancreatitis include:\nSometimes the underlying cause of chronic pancreatitis cannot be identified.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The most common symptom is upper abdominal pain, which often radiates to the back and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. The pain can occur daily or off and on, and can be mild or intense. As the disease gets worse and more of the pancreas is destroyed, pain may actually become less severe. During an attack, the pain often is made worse by drinking alcohol or eating a large meal high in fats.\nBecause a damaged pancreas can't produce important digestive enzymes, people with chronic pancreatitis may develop problems with digesting and absorbing food and nutrients. This can lead to weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, diarrhea, and greasy, foul-smelling stools. Over time, a damaged pancreas also can fail to produce enough insulin, which results in diabetes.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "There is no single test that can be used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis. If you have long-lasting abdominal pain or signs that your food is not being properly absorbed, such as weight loss or greasy stools, your doctor will ask you about alcohol use, and other factors that increase your risk of chronic pancreatitis and other digestive problems.\nThe diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis can be made based upon\nTests that may be done include:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once the cells of the pancreas have been destroyed, they do not regenerate easily. For this reason, diabetes and other problems that are associated with chronic pancreatitis require long-term treatment. It is unclear why pain develops with chronic pancreatitis, but once chronic pain develops, it tends to be long-lasting or even lifelong. Many patients require long-term medications for pain.\n",
      "Prevention": "Since most cases of chronic pancreatitis are associated with alcohol use, the best way to prevent the problem is to avoid or limit alcohol use. Anyone who has had an episode of alcohol-related acute pancreatitis should stop drinking entirely to lower the possibility of developing chronic pancreatitis. People who have been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis can prevent further damage by eliminating alcohol use.\nIf blocked bile or pancreatic ducts can be opened by surgery or ERCP, it may prevent further damage to the pancreas. If caught early, scarring can be minimized. However, only a minority of people with chronic pancreatitis actually benefit from this procedure.\n",
      "Treatment": "Because chronic pancreatitis cannot be cured, treatment is directed toward relieving pain, improving food absorption, and treating diabetes.\nFor milder pain, medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) may help. Pain management can be very challenging and often requires the help of a pain specialist.\nIn rare cases, surgery to open blocked ducts or remove part of the pancreas may be done to relieve pain.\nProblems absorbing food, and the resulting vitamin deficiencies, can be helped by taking supplemental digestive enzymes in pill or capsule form. Your doctor also may recommend that you follow a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet that also restricts some types of fats. Once digestive problems are treated, people often gain back weight and diarrhea improves.\nDiabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis almost always requires treatment with insulin.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See a health care provider if you have\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although chronic pancreatitis is an incurable condition, the severity, frequency, and type of symptoms can vary. Some people — especially those who quit drinking alcohol entirely — have very mild or occasional symptoms that are easily managed with medications. Other people — especially those who continue to drink alcohol — can have disabling, daily pain and may require frequent hospitalizations.\n",

      "What is chronic prostatitis?": "The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that sits below the bladder in men. This gland makes fluid that mixes with sperm to form semen.\n\nProstatitis is inflammation or swelling of the prostate gland. When symptoms start gradually and linger for more than a couple of weeks, the condition is called chronic prostatitis.\n\nThree major types of chronic prostatitis are:\nChronic prostatitis is common and affects adult men of all ages and from all backgrounds. About five percent of men experience symptoms of chronic prostatitis at some point in their lives. Chronic prostatitis is the reason for up to 25% of office visits to urologists. Urologists are doctors who specialize in diseases of the urinary tract.\nSome men develop a chronic infection in the prostate that does not cause any symptoms. Men with this problem may be diagnosed during an evaluation for other urological conditions, such as enlarged prostate or infertility. Doctors often treat the infection with the same antibiotics used for chronic bacterial prostatitis.\nBacterial infection of the prostate gland also can cause acute prostatitis, which starts suddenly and usually causes fever and more serious symptoms. Acute prostatitis is less common than chronic prostatitis.\n",
      "Symptoms of chronic prostatitis": "Prostatitis usually causes swelling of the prostate gland. The prostate surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder). The swollen prostate presses on the urethra causing pain or other problems with urination.\nTypical symptoms of chronic prostatitis include:\nIn some men, symptoms may be hardly noticed or only slightly annoying. Other men are quite bothered by chronic prostatitis and find that the symptoms interfere with work, leisure activities and sexual enjoyment.\n",
      "Diagnosing chronic prostatitis": "If your doctor suspects prostatitis, he or she will ask you to describe your symptoms in detail. Your doctor will also want to know:\nYour doctor will examine your prostate gland by inserting a gloved and lubricated finger into your rectum. In chronic prostatitis, the gland may be swollen, firm and tender, or it may feel normal. You may experience pain or an urgent need to urinate when pressure is applied to the prostate. Your doctor will examine you to look for other problems that may be causing your symptoms.\n\nThe next step will be to examine a urine specimen to look for white blood cells and bacteria. Often your doctor will ask you to produce separate urine specimens before and after your prostate gland is examined. Typical findings depend on the specific type of chronic prostatitis:\nIn most cases of chronic prostatitis, this simple evaluation is all that is needed to make a diagnosis and begin treatment. Occasionally, a person may have vague or unusual symptoms. Then your doctor will consider other diagnoses, such as interstitial cystitis, urethritis, benign enlargement of the prostate, or even prostate cancer. In such a situation, your doctor may recommend additional blood or urine tests, an ultrasound of the prostate, an examination of the bladder with a lighted telescope (cystoscopy) or a needle biopsy of the prostate.\n",
      "Expected duration of chronic prostatitis": "Chronic prostatitis may last for weeks or months before it is diagnosed. Some cases of chronic prostatitis respond promptly to treatment, and symptoms disappear over several days. In other cases, symptoms may linger for weeks or months or may come and go over a period of years.\n",
      "Preventing chronic prostatitis": "Chronic prostatitis cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treating chronic prostatitis": "For many years, antibiotics have been the mainstay of treatment for chronic prostatitis. Antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfa (Bactrim, Septra), ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and levofloxacin (Levaquin) are used most often to treat chronic bacterial prostatitis. Because it is difficult for antibiotics to get into the prostate gland, they must be given at high doses for an extended period, often four or more weeks.\nEven if no bacteria are seen in the urine, your doctor may still be concerned that you have a chronic bacterial prostatitis. In that situation, he or she may prescribe a course of antibiotics. Some men may get relief from this treatment.\nHowever, in many cases, antibiotics alone will not eliminate the problem. Other treatments that men may consider include:\nOften the exact reason why a man with chronic prostatitis has symptoms is not clear. And there may be more than one contributing factor. A treatment for one man may not work in another man with similar symptoms.\nSome men will improve on their own or with the first treatment that is tried. Others will continue to experience symptoms despite a variety of treatments.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a health care professional if you develop:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Chronic prostatitis can be very difficult to cure. Many men do not respond to one or more prolonged courses of antibiotics. Because little is understood about prostatitis that is not caused by infection, finding the right treatment may be difficult. Nonetheless, several potentially effective treatments are available.\nDon't be discouraged if your symptoms have not responded to the first or even second treatment. Keep working with your doctor to help you get relief. If you have unusual or particularly troubling symptoms, your doctor may refer you to a urologist or other specialist.\nThere is no evidence that chronic prostatitis increases the risk of developing prostate cancer.\n",

      "What is chronic sinusitis?": "Chronic sinusitis is a long-term inflammation of the sinuses. The sinuses are moist air spaces behind the bones of the upper face — between the eyes and behind the forehead, nose and cheeks. Normally, the sinuses drain through small openings into the inside of the nose.\nAnything that obstructs that flow can cause a buildup of mucus, and sometimes pus, in the sinuses. Drainage from the sinuses can be obstructed by structural abnormalities of the nose, infection, or tissue swelling caused by allergies. The buildup of mucus leads to increased sinus pressure and facial pain. In adults, chronic sinusitis most often is linked to nasal swelling caused by allergies, especially allergies to inhaled dust, mold, pollen, or the spores of fungi. These allergies trigger the release of histamine and other chemicals that cause the inner lining of the nose to swell and block sinus drainage.\nPolyps, nasal tumors and nasal fractures can obstruct the sinus drainage leading to chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis also can be seen in people whose sinuses and nasal passages are structurally abnormally narrow. People with asthma, cystic fibrosis, or immune system problems develop chronic sinusitis more often than others.\n",
      "Symptoms of chronic sinusitis": "The most common symptom is painful pressure in upper parts of the face, especially in the forehead, behind the nose, between or behind the eyes, or in the cheek. Sometimes, sinus pain can feel like a toothache. Other symptoms include nasal congestion, postnasal drip that is worse at night, and bad-smelling breath that is unrelated to dental problems. Fever and a thick, discolored nasal discharge are signs of acute sinusitis, a short-term sinus infection usually caused by viruses or bacteria. The same symptoms can be present in chronic sinusitis.\n",
      "Diagnosing chronic sinusitis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, how long you have had them, and what you may be allergic to in your environment. He or she will examine you, paying special attention to your nose and throat. During this examination, your doctor will check for:\nYour doctor usually can diagnose chronic sinusitis and start treatment based on your symptoms and the physical examination. Further tests usually are not necessary. If the diagnosis is not clear, or if your doctor suspects you may have a structural blockage, he or she may order tests to look at the sinuses — usually computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your sinuses. You also may be referred to a specialist for further tests. An ear, nose and throat specialist can take a closer look inside your nose and throat with a tiny scope that has a camera lens at the end. An allergy specialist can perform skin-prick or blood (RAST) tests to find out what you are allergic to.\n",
      "Expected duration of chronic sinusitis": "Symptoms of chronic sinusitis can last for months or years. Some doctors consider sinusitis to be chronic rather than acute when it lasts at least three months.\n",
      "Preventing chronic sinusitis": "If you have chronic sinusitis, avoid cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. You also should avoid spending long periods of time outdoors when there are high levels of airborne allergens or pollutants. Indoors, using air conditioners and humidifiers can sometimes help prevent symptoms of chronic sinusitis. If you have allergies, you can help to prevent episodes of sinusitis by identifying and avoiding triggers and by taking appropriate medications as directed. Several measures can be taken at home to remove many indoor airborne allergens that trigger sinus problems. Here are some things you can do:\n",
      "Treating chronic sinusitis": "If you think you have sinusitis, you can try some things at home first to help reduce swelling and open blocked sinuses. Inhaling steam and using nasal saline spray washes often helps. Decongestants, by mouth or nasal spray, are available without a prescription and can help to relieve the pressure. To control the pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others).\nBecause chronic sinusitis often is caused by inflammation related to allergies, identifying, treating and preventing your allergies helps to relieve the sinusitis. Allergy medications include antihistamines, decongestants, leukotriene inhibitors and anti-inflammatory medications.\nCorticosteroid nasal sprays also can relieve nasal swelling and sinus inflammation. If these sprays don't help, you may need a trial of oral steroids, such as prednisone. If there is evidence of active bacterial infection ,you may need to take a course of antibiotics. If your allergies are difficult to control, an allergy specialist can test you for specific allergies and administer desensitizing shots (immunotherapy) to treat your symptoms.\nIf symptoms are difficult to control with medications alone, you may need to see an ear, nose and throat specialist, who can determine if you need your sinuses drained or if you need endoscopic surgery to widen the sinus openings. Endoscopic surgery uses small scopes and instruments to see and operate through the nasal passages to get to the sinuses. If the blockage of the sinus opening is limited, balloon dilatation of the area may resolve the problem and avoid more involved surgery.\nNasal polyps and other structural blockages also can be removed with endoscopic sinus surgery. Even a deviated septum can be corrected with endoscopic surgery.\nPeople with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps not responding to other therapies may be candidates for treatment with one of the FDA approved monoclonal antibodies.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If your symptoms are not getting better after several days, or if you develop a fever or a brown or green discharge, you should see your doctor. If you develop a severe headache, you should call your doctor for a more urgent evaluation.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis for chronic sinusitis depends on its cause. Often medication or surgery is needed to reduce the inflammation or correct the blockage. In many cases, the inflammation has to be managed with medications for a long time to prevent recurrence.\n",

      "What is cirrhosis?": "No body organ performs a wider variety of essential jobs than the liver. It:\nCirrhosis is a disease in which normal liver cells are replaced by scar tissue, which interferes with all of these important functions. In extreme cases, the damage is so severe that the only solution is a liver transplant.\n\nCirrhosis has many causes. In the United States and Europe, the most common causes are excessive alcohol use and chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus.\nAlcohol has a toxic effect on liver cells. Alcoholic cirrhosis tends to develop after a decade or more of heavy drinking, although it is possible for \"social drinkers\" to have cirrhosis. It is not known why some people are more prone to adverse reactions than others, but women are at greater risk of cirrhosis, even when they drink less alcohol than men.\nChronic hepatitis B, which causes damage in a similar way, is another common cause of cirrhosis in the world. But it is less common in industrialized countries because of routine vaccination against hepatitis B.Chronic hepatitis C causes inflammation of the liver that eventually can lead to cirrhosis. Without treatment, about one out of every five people with chronic hepatitis C develops cirrhosis after 20 years.\nMore recently, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has become a more common cause of cirrhosis. Doctors call it nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Fat deposition in the liver leads to inflammation, which can progress to scarring.\nRarer causes of cirrhosis include:\n",
      "Symptoms of cirrhosis": "In its early stages, cirrhosis often has no symptoms. But as liver cells die, the organ makes less of the proteins that regulate fluid retention and blood clotting and loses its ability to metabolize the pigment bilirubin. This causes symptoms and complications that include:\nAs damage increases, the liver fails to detoxify the blood and becomes less able to metabolize many medications, which magnifies their effects. Eventually, toxins build up in the brain. These changes can produce:\nScarring also impedes blood flow and increases pressure in the portal vein, which moves blood from the stomach to the liver. This condition is called portal hypertension. Blood vessels in the stomach and esophagus swell, and the body creates new ones in an attempt to bypass the liver. These vessels, called varices, have thin walls. If one bursts, the resulting hemorrhage (major bleeding) can cause death within hours if not treated.\n",
      "Diagnosing cirrhosis": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history, family history of liver disease, diet, alcohol consumption, medications you are taking, and risk factors for hepatitis B and C, such as intravenous drug use. During a physical examination, the doctor determines whether the liver feels harder or larger than normal, looks for skin changes such as bruising and jaundice, and looks for evidence of fluid swelling in the legs or abdomen.\nBlood tests may be ordered to look for evidence of liver inflammation, an elevated bilirubin level, a buildup of toxins (such as ammonia) and reduced levels of essential substances made by the liver.\nTwo of the blood tests that indicate a poor prognosis in people with cirrhosis are a low albumin level and a high INR (adjusted Pro-Time). The high INR indicates the person's liver cannot make the normal amount of clotting proteins.\nThe liver may be viewed using ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan, or other imaging technique.\nCirrhosis can usually be diagnosed based on the history, physical exam, blood test results and imaging. Sometimes a liver biopsy is needed. A tiny sample of liver tissue is removed through a needle and then examined for scarring and damage to cells.\n",
      "Expected duration of cirrhosis": "Cirrhosis is usually a progressive disease. Although it usually cannot be reversed, the liver damage can be halted or slowed down with treatment or changes in behavior in many cases.\n",
      "Preventing cirrhosis": "The most important step you can take to prevent cirrhosis is to avoid excessive drinking. It is best to consume an average of no more than two alcoholic drinks a day for men or one drink a day for women. If you have chronic hepatitis or other liver problems, avoid alcohol completely.\nSome other causes of cirrhosis can be prevented. To avoid infection with hepatitis B and C, do not inject illegal drugs, snort cocaine, or have unprotected sex, especially with multiple partners. If you are considering body piercing or tattooing, make sure that the equipment is cleaned properly. Health care and emergency workers should follow infection control precautions carefully whenever they are exposed to blood.\nHepatitis B also can be prevented with a vaccine, a series of three shots that is 90% effective.\nBy preventing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, you prevent the small risk of developing cirrhosis. This means maintaining a healthy weight and getting plenty of exercise.\n",
      "Treating cirrhosis": "Treatment for cirrhosis varies depending on the cause and stage of the disease. Because liver damage usually cannot be reversed, the aim of all treatment is to keep the disease from getting worse and to reduce complications.\nRegardless of the cause, anyone with cirrhosis should abstain from alcohol and use caution in taking medications that can make liver disease worse, including over-the-counter acetaminophen (Tylenol and generic types). You also will be treated for underlying diseases -- for example, antiviral medications for chronic hepatitis B or C, corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant medications for autoimmune hepatitis, and phlebotomy, which is the periodic removal of a pint of blood -- to reduce iron levels in hemochromatosis.\nMuch of the treatment is directed at complications.\nBleeding varices pose an immediate, life threatening hazard. To prevent them from bleeding, doctors called gastroenterologists do endoscopy to find the varices and treat them. The varices can be injected with a solution to shrink them or they can be sealed with bands. The same procedure is done when varices are actively bleeding. Intravenous and oral drugs are also given to reduce bleeding.\nThe person may also need a procedure called transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). This involves creating a new blood channel in the liver that relieves some of the high portal pressure. With less portal pressure, there is less bulging of the varices. And new varices are less likely to form.\nIf liver function becomes too impaired from cirrhosis, a transplant is the only treatment. Approximately 80% to 90% of patients survive liver transplantation, and long-term survival rates have improved because of drugs such as cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) that suppress the immune system to keep it from attacking the new liver.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have any risk factors for liver disease, make an appointment with your doctor. Cirrhosis can often be prevented if action is taken early enough.\nIf you have cirrhosis, get immediate medical attention for:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Treatment leads to improvement in most cases when the disease is discovered in its earlier stages. Most patients are able to live a normal life for many years. The outlook is less favorable if liver damage is extensive or if someone with cirrhosis does not stop drinking. People with cirrhosis usually die of bleeding that can't be stopped, serious infections or kidney failure. They often enter irreversible coma in their last days.\n",

      "What are cluster headaches?": "Cluster headaches are very intense headaches. They usually start in the area around one eye, then spread to nearby areas of the face. Each headache lasts about a half-hour to three hours. Episodes can occur several times over 24 hours (in clusters). This happens daily, lasting several weeks to months.\nMost cluster headaches occur at night. This condition affects men much more frequently than women. Some people discover they have \"triggers\" that start the headache, such as:\nOn average, people experience one to three headache episodes daily for four to eight weeks. Once a cluster of episodes ends, the person may remain headache-free for months or years.\nThe cause of cluster headaches is unknown. They may be related to a temporary imbalance of brain chemicals.\n",
      "Symptoms of cluster headaches": "Symptoms of cluster headaches include:\n\nMany people feel better when they remain active during their headaches. This is in contrast to those experiencing migraine headaches. Migraine sufferers tend to seek out a quiet, dark room.\n",
      "Diagnosing cluster headaches": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history and your headache symptoms. This will help differentiate between cluster-type headaches or an underlying disease.\nYour doctor also will examine you to check for other possible causes of your headaches. If your exam is normal and your headaches fit the typical cluster pattern, you may not need any further testing.\nHowever, your doctor may order diagnostic tests if you have your symptoms are atypical for cluster headache. These tests could include computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head.\n",
      "Expected duration of cluster headaches": "Cluster headaches usually last a half-hour to three hours. They tend to occur one to three times daily for four to eight weeks.\nOnce a cluster of episodes passes, a person may remain headache-free for many months or sometimes years.\n",
      "Preventing cluster headaches": "The cause of cluster headaches remains a mystery. There is no way to prevent a first occurrence.\nPeople who have already experienced cluster headaches may be able to help prevent future attacks. To do so:\n",
      "Treating cluster headaches": "It is difficult to stop the pain of the first cluster headache you experience. The headache usually disappears by the time you reach the doctor's office or emergency room.\nOnce the problem has been diagnosed, your doctor may prescribe a therapy for you to keep on hand.\nInhaling 100% oxygen through a facemask for about 15 minutes can help. It must be done at the first signs of an attack to be effective. This oxygen must be prescribed by a doctor and obtained through a medical supplier.\nCertain drugs may be effective when used at the beginning of cluster pain. These include:\nCombining 100% oxygen with one of the triptans can be especially effective. However, dihydroergotamine should not be combined with a triptan.\nYour doctor will likely suggest additional medication to break the cycle or at least help decrease the frequency of headaches. And it will help to shorten the length of the active cluster period. Multiple medications have been used for this purpose. The calcium-channel blocker verapamil (Calan, Isoptin) is usually the most effective. However, it may take a week or two before it starts helping. Prednisone has a quicker onset of action. One potential strategy is to start both prednisone and verapamil at the onset of cluster headaches. The prednisone can be tapered over the next seven to 10 days.\nYour doctor may discuss the newest therapy for people with cluster headache. It's a monthly injection you give to yourself called galcanezumab (Emgality).\nDon't be discouraged if the first strategy is not successful. You and your doctor may need to try a few different therapies to find the one that works best for you.\nOn very rare occasions, neurosurgery might be considered for headaches that don't respond to medical therapy. Surgical procedures have had variable success, at best. They include permanent nerve blocks and implantation of precisely placed electrodes in the brain.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if any form of headache:\n",
      "Prognosis": "No therapies or lifestyle changes can consistently prevent cluster headaches. Medical treatment can help shorten active periods. It can help decrease the number and severity of painful episodes.\n",

      "What is Cogan's syndrome?": "Cogan's syndrome is a rare rheumatic disease characterized by inflammation of the ears and eyes. Cogan's syndrome can lead to vision difficulty, hearing loss and dizziness. The condition may also be associated with blood-vessel inflammation (called vasculitis) in other areas of the body that can cause major organ damage or, in a small number of cases, even death. It most commonly occurs in a person's 20s or 30s. The cause is not known. However, one theory is that it is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks tissue in the eye and ear.\n",
      "Symptoms of Cogan's syndrome": "The most common symptoms of Cogan's syndrome include:\nMore rarely, Cogan's syndrome can cause enlarged lymph nodes, rash, chest pain, arm pain, and shortness of breath.\n",
      "Diagnosing Cogan's syndrome": "A doctor diagnoses Cogan's syndrome after finding the typical combination of problems associated with this disease in the eye and inner ear. Until both the eye and the inner ear are affected, the diagnosis may be uncertain. Either area may be affected first, or the eye and ear problems may develop at the same time.\nYour doctor will want to rule out an infection (especially syphilis, tuberculosis, viral infection and chlamydia) or another rheumatic disease (including rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis) as the cause of your symptoms. Your doctor will refer you to an ophthalmologist for an eye examination to look for eye problems, including a condition called interstitial keratitis, which is inflammation of the cornea, the transparent covering of the eye. Your doctor also will want to evaluate your nervous system (for example, reflexes, strength and sensation), and check your ears by testing hearing, balance and inner ear function.\n",
      "Expected duration of Cogan's syndrome": "Cogan's syndrome is a chronic (long-lasting) disease. Symptoms come and go, or respond well to treatment, but usually the disease is prolonged or even lifelong.\n",
      "Preventing Cogan's syndrome": "There is no way to prevent Cogan's syndrome.\n",
      "Treating Cogan's syndrome": "Mild eye disease may be treated with anti-inflammatory medications, including steroids and NSAIDs that are applied to the eye. If these medications do not work well enough, oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline (sold under many brand names), may be recommended in case an infection is causing the eye inflammation.\nFor more severe disease, oral corticosteroids may be necessary. When large amounts of steroids are required or if the disease is severe and is not responding to steroid therapy, other immunosuppressive medications often are recommended. These immunosuppressive drugs include methotrexate (Rheumatrex), infliximab (Remicade), or azathioprine (Imuran). In some cases, other immunosuppressive medications or combinations of medicines are prescribed. Occasionally, if the disease has damaged blood vessels, surgery may need to be done to correct the problem.\nIf excess fluid in the inner ear is causing balance problems, your doctor may prescribe diuretic medications, which increase urination and removal of fluid from the body. A sense of imbalance may be treated with antihistamines, such as meclizine (Antivert), or benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium) or clonazepam (Klonopin) and bed rest.\nWhen hearing is impaired and does not improve with medical treatment, cochlear implants may be helpful. Cochlear implants are electronic devices that translate sounds into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain, bypassing the malfunctioning part of the ear. Part of the device is implanted in the ear, and part is worn outside the ear.\nIf the front of the eye is damaged severely by inflammation, a corneal transplant can improve vision. A corneal transplant is surgery that replaces the scarred cornea with one from an organ donor.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience any significant visual or auditory problems or difficulties with balance, contact your health care professional to be evaluated, especially if these symptoms continue.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many people with Cogan's syndrome have permanent visual or hearing damage. The condition is fatal in less than 10% of patients. However, most patients are able to manage their symptoms and limit complications of the disease with treatment.\n",

      "What is a collarbone fracture?": "When a bone breaks or cracks, the injury is called a fracture. In the collarbone (clavicle), fractures can happen in three separate areas:\n\nThe collarbone is one of the most commonly fractured bones. In most collarbone fractures, the ends of the fractured bone do not move apart widely, and the area of tissue damage involves only the collarbone. In rare cases, a sharp portion of the fractured bone either will pierce the surface skin (an open fracture) or cut into one of the large nerves or blood vessels that travel through the shoulder. In severe impact injuries, it is also possible for a portion of the fractured collarbone to penetrate the upper part the lung, causing serious breathing problems.\n",
      "Symptoms of a collarbone fracture": "Common symptoms of a fractured collarbone include:\n",
      "Diagnosing a collarbone fracture": "Your doctor will examine your collarbone, shoulder, and upper chest for swelling, deformity, abrasions, bruising and tenderness along the length of your collarbone. Your doctor also will press and feel the injured area gently to determine the position of any broken bone fragments under the skin.\nTo determine whether blood vessels or nerves were injured by the fractured collarbone, the doctor will check the strength of your pulse at your wrist and elbow and will check the feeling and strength in your arm, hand, and fingers. The doctor will also check your upper chest with a stethoscope to determine if your lungs have been damaged.\nIf the results of your physical examination suggest that that you have a fractured clavicle, your doctor will order x-rays to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration of a collarbone fracture": "Soreness at the fracture site typically resolves and movement around the shoulder returns to normal within six to 12 weeks. If your fracture is treated without surgery, you probably will be able to return to your normal level of physical activity six weeks after your shoulder strength and range of motion have returned to normal. In some cases, x-rays may be necessary to confirm that your collarbone has healed completely.\nIf you need surgery to repair your fractured collarbone, it may take four to six months before you can return to strenuous activities at work or on the playing field.\n",
      "Preventing a collarbone fracture": "It is hard to prevent collarbone fractures that happen on the playing field or because of accidental falls. To help prevent fractures caused by a steering wheel impact, wear a seat belt and shoulder harness when you drive, and only drive cars that have air bags.\n",
      "Treating a collarbone fracture": "If your collarbone has separated widely at the site of the break, the doctor will carefully move the ends of your fractured clavicle back into their normal position after giving you medications to ease your pain and relax your shoulder muscles. This treatment is called closed reduction. Once the ends of your fractured collarbone are realigned, you will wear a bandage or sling to reduce movement of the collarbone and  to keep the broken bone in place while it heals.\nAcetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen may be recommended to control pain.\nGradually, you will begin a program of physical therapy to restore the normal strength and range of motion in your shoulder joint. Once soreness at the fracture site resolves and movement around the shoulder returns to normal (typically within six to 12 weeks after the injury), wearing the sling may no longer be necessary.\nIf the collarbone has not separated widely, the manipulation (closed reduction) will not be necessary, and only the sling, medications for pain, and exercises will be recommended.\nMost collarbone fractures do not require surgery. However, surgery may be recommended if the fracture:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you cannot move your shoulder after a fall or other traumatic injury or if your collarbone is painful, swollen, tender or deformed.\nRemember that a fractured collarbone sometimes can pierce a lung or damage nerves and blood vessels. For this reason, it is especially important to call for emergency help if you feel short of breath, begin to cough up bloody fluids, or have numbness or tingling in your arm or hand.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most collarbone fractures heal within three months. Although there is often a slight bump in the contour of the collarbone at the healed fracture site, this tends to become smaller with time, especially in young people.\n",

      "What is a colon polyp?": "Colon polyps are growths of tissue inside the large intestine, also called the colon. Some polyps are mushroom-shaped protrusions on the end of a stalk. Others appear as bumps that lie flat against the intestinal wall.\n\nThere are several types of polyps. Most are noncancerous (benign), but one type, the adenomatous polyp, is associated with changes (called mutations) in the DNA of the lining of the colon. These mutations can progress into colon cancer. The larger the polyp, the greater the chance that it contains cancerous cells.\nSome people are born with a genetic tendency to develop multiple polyps. Inherited conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner's syndrome can cause hundreds of polyps to grow in the colon and rectum. Without surgery to remove the affected section of the intestine, it is almost certain that at least one of these polyps will turn into cancer by middle age. These two conditions are rare.\n",
      "Symptoms of a colon polyp": "Many times, people are not aware they have colon polyps because there are no symptoms. Larger growths can bleed, causing blood in the stool. Sometimes bleeding polyps can cause fatigue and other symptoms of anemia (low levels of red blood cells). On rare occasions, a large polyp can cause diarrhea or secretion of large amounts of potassium. This can cause marked fatigue and muscle weakness.\n",
      "Diagnosing a colon polyp": "Your doctor may use one or more of the following tests to determine whether you have colon polyps:\n\n",
      "Expected duration of a colon polyp": "If a polyp is not removed, it will continue to grow larger. It usually takes several years for a polyp to change to a cancer. However, some polyps have malignant cells even though they are small. About one-third of adenomatous polyps will progress to cancer in three to five years if undetected or ignored.\n",
      "Preventing a colon polyp": "The danger from polyps is that most cases of colon cancer spring from these growths. You can lower your chances of developing cancerous polyps in the following ways:\nIn addition, some research suggests these measures may help decrease the risk of colon cancer:\nWomen who take hormones after menopause have a lower risk of colon cancer. However, long term use of estrogen and progesterone after menopause should not be used for this purpose.\nBecause the risk of colon cancer increases with age, people age 45 and older should have periodic screening for early detection of polyps and colon cancer. Options for screening include:\nIf you have a hereditary condition that causes polyps to overgrow in the large intestine, you should begin frequent examinations at puberty. Your doctor may advise complete removal of the colon because there is a high likelihood of developing colon cancer by age 40. The other option is frequent screening with colonoscopy. How often you will need to have this done depends upon your age and what was seen on your last colonoscopy.\n",
      "Treating a colon polyp": "Often, the doctor can remove polyps during a colonoscopy. This is done by cutting the polyp from the wall of the colon using an electrical current passed through a wire loop at the end of the colonoscope. Sometimes, open surgery through the abdomen is necessary to remove a very large polyp. For cancerous polyps, surrounding tissue or a section of the colon may be removed as well.\n\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should call immediately for advice if you develop rectal bleeding. You also should have routine colon examinations starting at age 45. People with a family history of colon cancer at an early age, familial adenomatous polyposis, or Gardner's syndrome should begin screening earlier.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Polyps are common. But less than 1% of all polyps ever become cancerous. By removing polyps, the risk is even lower. Survival depends on the stage of cancer. If the cancerous cells are confined to a polyp or they have not grown deep into the outer layer of the colon, the prognosis is excellent. Colon cancer that spreads beyond the colon is associated with a lower risk of long term cancer-free survival.\n",

      "What is colorectal cancer?": "Colorectal cancer is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the colon and/or rectum.\nTogether, the colon and rectum make up the large intestine. The large intestine carries waste from the small intestine and eliminates it through the anus.\nColorectal tumors often begin as small growths (polyps) on the inside of the large intestine. Polyps that are not removed eventually can become cancerous.\n",
      "Risk factors for colorectal cancer": "The major risk factors for colorectal cancer include:\nAdditional potential risk factors:\n",
      "Symptoms of colorectal cancer": "Polyps and early colorectal cancer generally don't cause symptoms. As a result, they are usually caught during screening.\nMore advanced cancer can cause:\n",
      "Diagnosing colorectal cancer": "If your doctor suspects colorectal cancer, he or she will perform a colonoscopy. This is done with an instrument called a scope. A scope is a flexible tube with a camera attached at one end. The doctor inserts the scope into your rectum and colon to look for polyps or cancer.\nDuring the procedure, one or more biopsies may be performed. The sample(s) are sent to the laboratory for examination under the microscope.\nYour doctor may also order additional tests, such as blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans.\n",
      "Expected duration of colorectal cancer": "Without treatment, colon cancer will continue to grow.\n",
      "Preventing colorectal cancer": "The best defense against colorectal cancer is regular screening. Screening tests are designed to find polyps so they can be removed before they become cancerous.\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society recommend that all adults at average risk for colorectal cancer begin screening at age 45 because of a rising number of younger people diagnosed with the disease. People at higher risk should begin screening earlier.

      "Rectal cancer": "Treatment for rectal cancer often combines surgery with chemotherapy and radiation, which can be given before or after surgery.\nEarly stage rectal cancer may only require removal of polyps. Late stage rectal cancer may require removal of the rectum, anus, and part of the colon.\nIn some cases of late-stage surgery, the surgeon must reroute the colon through a hole in the abdomen to create a new way for the body to eliminate waste. This is called a colostomy.\n",

      "What is the common cold (viral rhinitis)?": "The common cold, also called viral rhinitis, is one of the most common infectious diseases in humans. The infection is usually mild and improves without treatment. Because of the large number of people who get the common cold, this illness results in more than 22 million days of missed school and an even greater number of absent days from work every year in the United States. The average American has 1 to 3 colds per year.\nThe common cold is an upper respiratory infection that is caused by several families of viruses. Within these virus families, more than 200 specific viruses that can cause the common cold have been identified. The virus family that causes the most colds is called rhinovirus. Rhinoviruses cause up to 40% of colds, and this virus family has at least 100 distinct virus types in its group. Other important upper respiratory virus families are named coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Since so many viruses can cause cold symptoms, development of a vaccine for the common cold has not been possible.\nRhinoviruses cause most colds in the early fall and spring. Other viruses tend to cause winter colds and their symptoms can be more debilitating. There is no evidence that going out in cold or rainy weather makes you more likely to catch a cold.\n",
      "Symptoms of the common cold": "The common cold causes a group of symptoms that are easily recognized by patients and doctors. About 50% of patients will develop a sore throat, which is often the first symptom to appear because it can occur as early as 10 hours after infection. This is followed by congestion in the nose and sinuses, a runny nose and sneezing. Hoarseness and cough can also occur and may last longer than other symptoms, sometimes for several weeks. High fevers are rare with the common cold.\n",
      "Diagnosing the common cold": "Most people diagnose the common cold by the typical symptoms of runny nose, congestion and sneezing. Usually it isn't necessary for you to see a health care provider. You should see a doctor if you develop a high fever, severe sinus pain, ear pain, shortness of breath or new wheezing. These are symptoms that suggest you either have something other than a cold or a complication of the cold.\n",
      "Expected duration of the common cold": "Symptoms typically peak on the second, third or fourth days of infection and last about 1 week. People are most infectious (likely to pass the cold onto others) during the first 24 hours of the illness, and they usually remain infectious for as long as the symptoms last. Up to 25% of people may have persistent symptoms, such as a nagging cough that can last for several weeks. For a small number of people, the congestion from a cold may allow another illness to take hold, such as a bacterial infection of the middle ear or the sinuses. Respiratory complications such as bronchitis or asthma can cause symptoms that last for a month or longer.\n",
      "Preventing the common cold": "The common cold most often is transmitted by direct contact with germs from the nose, mouth, or coughed or sneezed droplets from someone who is infected, usually by hand-to-hand contact. Virus particles are passed from one person's hand to another person's hand. The second person then touches his or her eyes or rubs his or her nose, spreading the virus there, where the virus can start a new infection. It is possible to become infected by touching a surface, such as a tabletop or doorknob that was recently touched by an infected person, and then touching your eyes or nose. These viruses also can be spread by inhaling particles from the air after an infected person has coughed or sneezed.\nTo avoid getting or spreading a cold, it helps to clean your hands often, carefully dispose of all used tissues, and avoid rubbing your eyes and nose. If possible, you should avoid close, prolonged exposure to people who have colds. Usually about half of the family members of an infected person will become ill. Colds also are transmitted frequently in schools and day care facilities.\nPeople who get less than 7 hours of sleep per night are more likely to get colds compared to those averaging at least 7 hours of sleep per night. Also people who exercise regularly, especially those who exercise daily, have fewer colds per year than those who are less active.\n",
      "Treating the common cold": "Although medical therapies can improve the symptoms of the common cold, they do not prevent, cure or shorten the illness. Drink enough fluids, get plenty of rest and treat your symptoms to keep yourself as comfortable as possible.\nGargling warm salt water can soothe a sore throat. Inhaling steam may improve nasal congestion temporarily. Over-the-counter cold remedies that contain a decongestant will help to dry secretions and relieve congestion. These remedies may also relieve cough, if the cough is triggered by mucus in the throat.\nIt is important to keep in mind that antibiotics do not cure the common cold or shorten the length of time that symptoms last.\nVitamin C and echinacea (a frequently used herbal therapy) have been widely rumored to decrease the likelihood of developing the common cold and to shorten symptoms, but no conclusive research has shown that this is true. Zinc-containing products advertised to treat the common cold remain popular. Some studies suggest that zinc lozenges may shorten the duration of symptoms, but questions remain regarding the best and safest dose.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "A small percentage of people who have a common cold develop bacterial infections of the middle ear, sinuses or lungs. If you develop high fevers, ear pain, severe pain over your sinuses, wheezing or shortness of breath, you should see your physician to be sure that you don't have a more serious illness.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The common cold is a mild infection that improves on its own within a week. However, some people may have symptoms that last for several weeks, and a small number of people may develop bacterial infections of the ear, sinuses or lungs following the common cold.\n",

      "What is complex regional pain syndrome?": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and long-lasting condition. CRPS usually causes severe, constant, burning pain in the affected arm or leg.\nThe cause of CRPS remains unknown. However, this condition can be triggered by damage to nerve fibers in tissue that has been injured. Smoking is a risk factor for the condition. The cause may be autoimmune, as autoantibodies (antibodies directed against normal tissue) targeting nerve cells have been identified in people with CRPS. Experts believe that in CRPS, nerves become overly sensitive. Painful signals become more painful. And common stimuli, such as light touch and temperature changes, also are experienced as pain.\nThis condition usually starts after an injury or other event. Examples include trauma, fracture, infection, surgery, stroke or wearing a plaster cast.\nOften, the injury that triggers CRPS is mild compared with the pain that follows it. However, the condition also can follow more severe injury or paralysis. The pain often is not limited to the area that was injured.\nThis condition can occur at any age. It is relatively rare.\nCRPS has been called by many other names. These include reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS), algodystrophy, causalgia, shoulder-hand syndrome, Sudeck's atrophy and transient osteoporosis. Although the name was officially changed from RSDS to CRPS, the name change has not been universally accepted.\nThere are two types of CRPS:\n",
      "Symptoms of CRPS": "Symptoms of CRPS can include:\nThe condition can progress through three stages. However, not everyone goes through every stage.\nIn the earliest stage, days to weeks after an injury, the limb can become dry, hot, red and painful. Even the lightest touch or the slightest movement can cause excruciating pain. At this point, CRPS can be mistaken for other conditions. Your doctor may not be able to confirm the diagnosis of CRPS at this stage.\nOver the next few weeks to months, the skin can become shiny, thin and cool. The limb becomes mottled and purplish. There is considerable swelling. Pain worsens. The nails become brittle and can grow faster or slower than normal. As the limb becomes difficult to move, you may have more pain further up the limb. This might be related to muscle stiffness and soreness.\nSome people experience other movement problems, including weakness, spasm and tremor. An affected limb can become permanently flexed or bent (contractures). In some people, the skin can become tight, dry and shriveled. The bones can become brittle because they aren't being used. The skin, muscles and joints stiffen so that the affected area cannot be moved. Some patients have less pain at this point. Once the disease reaches this point, it is extremely difficult to treat.\n",
      "Diagnosing CRPS": "Your doctor will ask questions about your medical history. He or she will examine you.\nCRPS is diagnosed when the following symptoms are present:\nIn the earliest stages, before many of these features develop, diagnosis is difficult or impossible.\nIn later stages, X-rays sometimes show bone loss, especially around the joints. A bone scan can help to confirm the diagnosis. But the condition cannot be diagnosed with a bone scan alone.\nTwo tests that evaluate nerve function may be ordered. They look for nerve damage or another cause of your symptoms. These tests are called electromyography and nerve conduction studies.\nYour doctor also may recommend a diagnostic sympathetic block. This is an injection in the neck or low back. If the block reduces or eliminates pain, this can help to confirm the diagnosis.\nSome physicians use other specialized tests to help diagnose this condition. For example:\n",
      "Expected duration of CRPS": "Some people with CRPS improve without treatment. But getting early treatment improves your chances of pain relief.\nAbout half of people with CRPS continue to experience pain six months after treatment was started.\n",
      "Preventing CRPS": "There is no way to prevent CRPS because the cause is not clear.\nHowever, physical activity or physical therapy after stroke may prevent CRPS following stroke.\nAnd there is limited evidence that vitamin C (500 milligrams daily) may prevent CRPS following wrist fracture.\nAs smoking is a risk factor for CRPS, smoking cessation may play a role in preventing the condition from developing.\n",
      "Treating CRPS": "It is important to get care from health care professionals who have expertise in the treatment of CRPS. These professionals include an anesthesiologist, pain specialist, vascular surgeon, physical therapist and/or occupational therapist.\nMaintaining movement is an important goal of treatment. Your doctor will likely recommend physical or occupational therapy, together with supervised exercises. Once a reasonable degree of movement is restored, an exercise routine should be started. This will help to strengthen muscles and joints, and maintain functioning.\nIn many cases, psychological and behavioral therapy can be helpful.\nMedications can help to manage pain. Corticosteroids and physical therapy can help to ease pain during an acute episode, but long-term results are mixed.\nMedications that may help include:\nA transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (TENS) unit sometimes can help to relieve pain. This small, battery-operated device is thought to work by blocking nerve impulses. Biofeedback also can help to control pain, blood flow and skin temperature.\nSimple measures such as applying heat or cold may help. Applying cold might relieve pain temporarily. But ice may worsen the symptoms of CRPS later on. The response to heat also varies.\nFor severe pain or pain that does not respond to other treatment, your doctor may recommend a nerve block. During this procedure, an injection of a numbing agent is administered near the affected nerves or alongside the spinal column to block the nerves of the sympathetic nervous system. It usually is done as a series of three to five injections over seven to 14 days. If the numbing is effective, a more permanent procedure called a sympathectomy may be done. In this procedure, the nerves are destroyed with chemicals or by surgery.\nNewer treatments include:\nThese treatments do not always work and may be associated with complications. But for severe cases that have not responded to other treatments, the benefits of the \"last resort\" treatments may exceed the risks.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your physician if you experience the symptoms of CRPS.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the better the prognosis.\nIf treatment is started early, symptoms can disappear after as few as three months. Delayed treatment can lead to permanent bone and muscle changes.\nThe overall response to treatment is poor. In at least half of cases, people with CRPS are still in pain months and even years later.\n",

      "What is it?": "A concussion is a short-term disturbance in brain function caused by a head injury. A concussion often causes\nMost head injuries happen during motor vehicle accidents, falls, sports, and assaults. Alcohol and drug use can be major contributing factors.\nUsually there is direct trauma to the head (for example, the head hitting the ground or the windshield of a car). In the elderly, serious head injuries can result from even minor falls. Injuries also can occur from rapid acceleration or deceleration, as may happen in a whiplash injury. People who injure their heads often injure their necks, too.\nHead imaging with MRI or CT scans of someone with a concussion rarely show obvious signs of brain injury.\nOccasionally, minor head trauma can trigger a more serious problem such as bruising of the brain tissue (brain contusion) or bleeding within the head (subdural hematoma or subarachnoid hemorrhage). Bleeding and other complications of minor head injuries appear to be more common in the elderly and in people taking blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin).\n",
      "Symptoms": "A concussion can cause any or all of the following symptoms:\nSymptoms most often appear immediately after the injury. However, in some cases, a person will feel fine at first and have the symptoms minutes to hours later.\nSymptoms such as coma (unresponsiveness), seizures, or paralysis or weakness of an arm or leg suggest a more serious form of head injury.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A doctor should check anyone who has a head injury, especially if the person lost consciousness or showed a change in thinking, such as confusion or memory loss. A doctor usually will want to know\nThe doctor will do a thorough physical and neurological exam. The doctor will check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, the way your eyes respond to light, reflexes and balance, and your ability to answer questions and remember things. If a doctor sees you immediately after a head injury, the examination may be repeated over several hours to make sure you are not getting worse.\nIf you have mild symptoms, are awake and alert, and have a normal examination, your doctor may just monitor you without doing any more tests. This monitoring can be done at home if you have had a very minor injury. If your symptoms are serious or your neurological exam is abnormal, you will likely need a CT scan of your brain to look for signs of a more serious head injury.\nIf you are sent home, have someone stay with you for the first 24 to 48 hours because symptoms can become worse quickly or you could lose consciousness if your injury is more serious than your doctor suspected.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Young people and athletes may recover from a head injury in minutes or hours. Some people experience lingering symptoms such as headache, dizziness, disrupted sleep, irritability, and poor concentration for weeks or even months. In general, the more severe the concussion, the longer the recovery period. Doctors often use the term post-concussion syndrome for these lingering symptoms. The duration of a post-concussion syndrome varies. Most people recover completely within three months.\nRepeated minor injuries over a short period greatly increase the risk of serious or permanent brain damage. Young people who play contact sports are at particular risk of these injuries. If you have had a head injury, talk to your doctor about when it is safe to return to your usual activities, including contact sports.\n",
      "Prevention": "Accidents, including head injuries, are the leading cause of death in young people. Many of these accidents are related to drug and alcohol use. Many accidents can be prevented by avoiding dangerous activities or wearing safety equipment.\nTo help prevent head injuries:\n",
      "Treatment": "A person that has a concussion while playing sports must immediately stop. Return to play should not happen until the person has been evaluated by a health professional.\nMost minor head injuries improve with rest and observation. Your doctor may choose to observe you in the hospital or may send you home under the care of a responsible adult. The doctor will give this person specific instructions about watching for danger signs.\nThere are no definitive guidelines regarding how long a person should rest. A reasonable approach is to avoid activities that are physically and mentally taxing for one to two days following the head injury. If symptoms recur when becoming more active again, slow down and notify your doctor.\nNo medication has been shown to speed recovery from a concussion. Headache and neck pains can be treated with over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brand names). If you have more severe pain, your doctor may give you a prescription pain reliever.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call for emergency help if you find someone unconscious at an accident scene. Seek immediate medical attention if someone with a head injury experiences any of the following symptoms:\nEven if a head injury appears minor, and the symptoms are mild, certain people are at high risk of serious complications. Call a doctor or go to an emergency room immediately if an injured person:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people with minor head injuries recover without any problems. Keep in mind, however, that some symptoms (headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating) may improve slowly over six to 12 weeks. Recovery will probably be slower in people whose injuries resulted in long periods of unconsciousness or amnesia. Recovery is also slower in the elderly, in those with previous head trauma, and in people with psychiatric or substance abuse problems.\nA small percentage of people who suffer minor head injury may develop permanent disabilities or a condition called persistent post-concussive syndrome. This may include headaches, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating. Consult your doctor if you are still experiencing any symptoms three months after your head injury. Although there is no known cure for this condition, treatment is available for many of the symptoms.\n",

      "What is constipation and impaction?": "Normally, people have bowel movements at fairly regular intervals, and stool passes out of the body easily without much straining or discomfort. Although the normal frequency of bowel movements varies from person to person, about 95% of healthy adults have a pattern that ranges from three times a day to three times a week.\nIn constipation, bowel movements either occur less often than expected or the stool is hard, dry, and difficult to pass. Most of the time, constipation is not related to an illness or digestive disorder. Instead, the problem is caused by diet, lifestyle, medications, or some other factor that hardens the stool or interferes with the stool's ability to pass comfortably. Some common triggers of constipation in adults include:\nLess often, constipation may be a symptom of an illness or condition that affects the digestive tract, the brain, or the spinal cord. Some examples include irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal obstruction, diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, hypothyroidism, abnormally high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injury. Constipation can also be caused by abnormal positioning of pelvic organs (for example, sagging of the uterus, called \"uterine prolapse\"), or abnormal contraction of muscles in the pelvis.\nConstipation is a very common problem that affects at least 80% of people at some time during their lives. Although adults of all ages can suffer from constipation, the risk of this problem increases dramatically after age 65 in both men and women.\nOccasionally, long-term constipation develops into fecal impaction, which is a blocked colon from a mass of stool that can't be moved by colon contractions. Fecal impaction can cause pain and vomiting, and a person with fecal impaction may require emergency treatment or hospitalization. Fecal impaction is more likely to occur in the elderly and bedridden.\n",

Review your current diet, your level of daily exercise, and your bowel habits. In particular, do you often ignore the urge to have a bowel movement because it is inconvenient? Then take preventive measures, such as adding fiber to your diet, drinking plenty of fluid, and getting regular exercise. If this does not relieve your problem, contact your doctor.\nIf you have constipation together with rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, or abdominal distention (bloating), contact your doctor immediately. It is best in this case for your doctor to evaluate you, including a physical exam and digital rectal examination.\nIf your symptoms indicate you might have fecal impaction, your doctor can confirm the diagnosis by examining your abdomen and by checking for a mass of impacted feces during the digital rectal exam. You may need other tests, including blood tests, an abdominal CT scan, or sigmoidoscopy (in which a special instrument is used to view the lower colon).\nConstipation can be a symptom of colon cancer. The risk of colon polyps and colon cancer increases with age. People age 45 and older should be sure that they are up to date with screening for polyps and cancer.\n",
      "Expected duration of constipation and impaction": "How long constipation lasts depends on its cause. In most otherwise healthy adults, constipation improves gradually within a few weeks after they increase their intake of dietary fiber and fluid and begin exercising regularly. However, constipation in bedridden people with neurological problems can be persistent and is a risk factor for fecal impaction.\n",
      "Preventing constipation and impaction": "In many cases, you can prevent constipation by taking the following steps:\n",
      "Treating constipation and impaction": "If you have uncomfortable symptoms of constipation, the first step is to make sure you are drinking enough fluids, and to increase the fiber content of your diet by adding cereal grains, fruits, and vegetables, or daily doses of a fiber supplement (for example, Metamucil or Citrucel). If constipation persists, it is reasonable to use a laxative treatment to help your bowel expel the stool. There are many laxatives available without a prescription, and they are safe for occasional use.\nSalt-based or carbohydrate-based (\"osmotic\") laxatives use natural salts, magnesium salts, or undigested sugars to help loosen stool by drawing water through the bowel wall into the bowel. Examples are milk of magnesia and polyethylene glycol (MiraLax).\nStimulant laxatives, such as laxatives that contain senna, cascara, or bisacodyl, are less gentle. Stimulant laxatives cause the colon muscles to contract more frequently or more aggressively.\nLaxatives are available in forms that can be swallowed or inserted into the rectum as a suppository.\nEnemas also can relieve constipation and are available at pharmacies without a prescription. A traditional enema is done with a bag of liquid (usually a mixture of salt and water) attached to a plastic tube with a tapered tip. The enema fluid can be emptied into the rectum after the tip is inserted into the anus. The fluid is emptied when you lift the bag several inches and allow the fluid to move with gravity. An enema loosens stool in the rectum and triggers the rectal muscles to squeeze as a reaction to their being stretched.\nIf you have fecal impaction, your doctor may remove part of the fecal mass by hand, by using a lubricated, gloved finger inserted in the rectum. The rest of the mass usually can be removed with an enema. Once the impacted stool is removed, your doctor will have you follow a high-fiber diet and may recommend a stool-softening medication or laxative to promote regular bowel movements.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if your bowel movements stop and you develop abdominal pain or distention. Also contact your doctor immediately if you have any bleeding from your rectum.\nCall your doctor for milder symptoms if you want advice, or if constipation continues for longer than a couple of weeks, or if you need laxatives more than two or three times per week to help you move your bowels.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people with constipation can achieve normal bowel function through diet and lifestyle changes.\nThe outlook for most people with fecal impaction is good. However, it is common for fecal impaction to return if constipation is not improved with additional treatment. A long-term program of mild laxatives, periodic enemas, or both may be necessary.\n",

      "What is contact dermatitis?": "Contact dermatitis is skin inflammation. It occurs because the skin has been exposed to a substance that irritates it or causes an allergic reaction.\nMany natural and artificial chemicals can trigger contact dermatitis. These include ingredients found in:\nCommon skin exposure (contact) that can lead to contact dermatitis includes:\n\nDoctors classify contact dermatitis into two types. The type depends on the cause of inflammation:\nIn children, the most common form of irritant contact dermatitis is \"diaper rash.\" This is a skin reaction in the diaper area. It is caused by prolonged contact with the natural chemicals found in urine and stool. Childhood irritant contact dermatitis also can develop around the mouth because of skin contact with dribbles of baby food or drools of saliva.\nIn adults, this condition is often an occupational illness. It is triggered by exposure to strong soaps, solvents or cutting agents. It is especially common among:\nBut it can occur in people who do household chores or have hobbies involving exposure to irritating chemicals, and those with sensitive skin who over use exfoliants.\nWith allergic contact dermatitis, the inflammation may not develop until 24 to 36 hours after contact with the allergen. This is because allergic contact dermatitis involves the body's immune defenses. The immune response is a process that takes some time.\nSkin allergies vary from person to person. The most common types of allergens responsible are:\n\n",
      "Symptoms of contact dermatitis": "Symptoms of contact dermatitis may vary slightly, depending on the cause.\nIrritant contact dermatitis.In mild cases, there may be only mild redness of the skin. More severe cases may cause skin swelling, blistering or ulceration.\nSymptoms usually begin right after exposure to the harmful substance. They are limited to areas of the skin that have been in direct contact with the irritant. For example, a janitor may develop symptoms on his hands after washing the floor with a strong detergent.\nAllergic contact dermatitis.This usually causes skin redness, blistering and severe itching. Symptoms may not appear for several hours or even days after exposure.\nThe location and pattern of the skin reaction may provide clues to the cause of the problem. For example, poison ivy usually appears as a pattern of tiny lines or streaks in places where plant leaves have brushed against the skin. Allergies to metal jewelry often cause rings of skin inflammation around the neck and wrist.\nContact dermatitis can become a long-lasting (chronic) condition. This is more likely if:\nIn chronic contact dermatitis, the skin eventually becomes thick, scaly and dry. Skin color changes and there are areas of hair loss.\n",
      "Diagnosing contact dermatitis": "Depending on your pattern of skin symptoms, the doctor will ask about your:\nIn some cases, your doctor may need to ask for the names of specific ingredients in your personal care products. In particular, the doctor will ask about:\nAfter reviewing your history of allergies and chemical exposures, your doctor usually can confirm the diagnosis of contact dermatitis by examining your skin.\nIf your doctor suspects allergic contact dermatitis and cannot identify the likely allergen, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist for patch testing. Small amounts of specific allergens are applied to the skin of your back, and then covered with tape. After 48 hours, the doctor removes the tape. He or she examines the skin for signs of an allergic reaction. A second reading is done after three to seven days.\n",
      "Expected duration of contact dermatitis": "With proper treatment, your symptoms probably will clear up within two to three weeks. However, you must stop exposing your skin to the irritating substance.\nIf you continue to have long-term exposure to harmful chemicals or allergens, you eventually may develop symptoms of chronic contact dermatitis. This can last for many years.\n",
      "Preventing contact dermatitis": "In general, you can prevent contact dermatitis by avoiding exposure to irritating chemicals, plants, jewelry and other substances that trigger irritant or allergic contact dermatitis.\nTo help prevent diaper dermatitis:\n",
      "Treating contact dermatitis": "Your doctor usually will treat contact dermatitis with the following:\nOf these, the last three are less likely to cause drowsiness.\nFor many people, oatmeal baths (Aveeno) also help.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you are troubled by red and very itchy skin. Also call if your skin is cracked, blistered or painfully dry.\nEven if you are certain that your skin problem is \"just a case of poison ivy,\" call your doctor's office for advice. He or she may be able to prescribe a more effective medication than over-the-counter remedies.\n",
      "Prognosis": "For most cases of contact dermatitis, the outlook is excellent. This is provided you can identify the substance that triggered your contact dermatitis and avoid it in the future.\n",

      "What is a corneal abrasion?": "The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped \"window\" that covers the front of the eye. A nick, scratch, or scrape of the cornea is called a corneal abrasion.\nCorneal abrasions are one of the most common forms of eye injury. In some cases, they are caused by the direct impact of a sharp object, such as a pencil, staple, nail, or sewing pin. They also can be caused by small, airborne particles, such as dust, sand, or flying debris from soldering, woodworking, or weed trimming. Even fingernails can cause a corneal abrasion.\nAlthough corneal abrasions can occur in people of all ages, people more likely to have this happen include:\nThe cornea has several layers of cells and membranes. The thin top layer, called the epithelium, is composed of sensitive cells that are similar to skin. Below this surface layer lies a tough, protective structure called Bowman's membrane. The epithelium and Bowman's membrane together make up only 10% of the thickness of the cornea. They are the two layers most involved in corneal abrasions. Abrasions that involve only the surface epithelium have a good chance of healing without any long-term effects. However, deeper abrasions that penetrate through the Bowman's membrane are more likely to cause permanent corneal scars. These scars are opaque, whitish areas in the cornea that may interfere with normal vision.\nIn the United States, corneal abrasions are the most common eye injury in children. Boys get corneal abrasions twice as often as girls between the ages of 5 and 15. Most corneal abrasions are superficial injuries that involve only the surface layer of the cornea. Although these abrasions can be very painful, they don't usually cause permanent vision problems.\n",
      "Symptoms of a corneal abrasion": "Symptoms of a corneal abrasion can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing a corneal abrasion": "Your doctor will examine your eye with a light to check for any obvious corneal injuries, small specks of dust or dirt, or other foreign objects. To confirm the diagnosis of a very small corneal abrasion, your doctor may need to place a small drop of a yellow-orange dye called fluorescein into your eye. This dye will cause any area of abrasion to look greenish under a special blue light.\nUsually, if you have only a mild corneal abrasion, you will not need any other tests. However, if your injury is more serious, your doctor may examine your eye with device called a slit lamp, and also test your vision.\n",
      "Expected duration of a corneal abrasion": "With proper treatment, symptoms of a mild corneal abrasion almost always improve or disappear totally within 24 to 48 hours. For more severe abrasions, symptoms often last longer.\n",
      "Preventing a corneal abrasion": "Most corneal abrasions can be prevented, especially those that happen in the workplace or during sports. To help prevent corneal abrasions and other types of eye trauma, you can take these actions:\nClean your contact lenses thoroughly before you insert them, as directed by your eye care professional. Also, make sure that your hands are clean whenever you handle your lenses.\n",
      "Treating a corneal abrasion": "If you think that you have dust or dirt in your eye, avoid the urge to rub it. If you are wearing contact lenses, remove them immediately. Next, try washing your eye for several minutes with clear, clean water to see if this relieves the problem. If no water is available, pull your upper eyelid outward and downward over your lower eyelid. This simple maneuver may allow your natural flow of tears to flush the debris away. If these strategies do not relieve your symptoms, or if you suspect that your eye has been scratched by a sharp object (even a fingernail), call your doctor.\nIf you have a corneal abrasion, your doctor will usually prescribe an antibiotic in either eye drops or an eye ointment to prevent an infection from developing in the injured area. You doctor also may recommend that you take acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and other brand names), or another nonprescription pain reliever to treat your eye pain.\nIf your eye is overly sensitive to light, or if your eye pain is not relieved by nonprescription medications, your doctor may prescribe drugs called cycloplegic drugs. These medications will relieve your eye symptoms by temporarily reducing the activity of muscles that control the size of your pupil.\nIf you usually wear contact lenses, do not wear them again until your doctor says that you can. Also, avoid wearing eye makeup until your corneal abrasion has healed completely.\nOnce you have completed one day of treatment for a corneal abrasion, your doctor will want an update on your symptoms to confirm that your eye has started to improve. This usually means either a follow-up office visit for an eye check, or some other form of contact with your doctor.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you have symptoms of a corneal abrasion, or if you are being treated for a corneal abrasion and your symptoms do not improve within 24 hours after treatment begins.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With proper treatment, most superficial corneal abrasions heal quickly without any complications. In general, the milder the abrasion, the faster the recovery time. Deeper abrasions that penetrate through Bowman's membrane are more likely to cause permanent corneal scars that can interfere with vision. If necessary, severe scarring often can be treated successfully with a corneal transplant.\n",

      "What are corns and calluses?": "Corns and calluses are a thickening of the outer layer of skin. This thickening is known medically as hyperkeratosis. Corns and calluses develop as part of the skin's normal defense against prolonged rubbing, pressure and other forms of local irritation.\n\n",
      "Symptoms of corns and calluses": "On the feet, a small corn or callus may not cause any symptoms. However, a large, bulky corn or callus can cause foot pain and difficulty walking.\nAfter prolonged irritation, a discolored area (brown, red or black) may develop under a large corn or callus. This discoloration is caused by a small amount of bleeding in the space between thick and normal skin. In severe cases, the thick and normal skin may separate, exposing the area to possible infection, especially in people with diabetes.\n",
      "Diagnosing corns and calluses": "Your health care professional probably will ask about your shoes, because shoes with narrow toes are more likely to cause corns. He or she also will ask about your foot history and your history of other medical problems, including diabetes and circulation problems. Some types of foot problems can alter the mechanics of the foot, causing abnormal pressure on certain areas and leading to calluses. Also, any previous surgery or trauma to the feet may affect the structure and alignment of foot bones, increasing the risk of calluses.\nTo assess whether your corns and calluses are related to foot abnormalities, your doctor will inspect your feet for toe deformities, structural problems of the bones, poor bone alignment and problems related to an abnormal way of walking (gait). If your doctor finds some abnormality during this part of the foot exam, he or she may suggest a specific type of padding or shoe insert to help prevent your corns and calluses from returning or causing as much discomfort.\nAlso, whenever there is a painful area of thickened skin on your feet, your doctor may need to check whether it is a plantar wart, a localized skin infection caused by human papilloma virus. The diagnosis can be made by shaving down the thickened skin and looking for tiny blood vessels at the base and a lack of normal skin ridges (as in a fingerprint), the hallmarks of a plantar wart.\n",
      "Expected duration of corns and calluses": "Corns and calluses can be long-term problems if you consistently wear shoes that do not fit properly. Even with good footwear, you may continue to have painful corns and calluses if there is some abnormality in your gait or foot structure that causes unusual stress on parts of your feet when you walk.\n",
      "Preventing corns and calluses": "In most cases, you can help to prevent corns and calluses by wearing shoes that fit properly. In particular, choose low-heeled, comfortable shoes that have enough space around the toes. Wear socks to cushion any areas of unusual rubbing or pressure, and use foot powder to reduce friction.\n",
      "Treating corns and calluses": "If your corns and calluses are painful, your doctor may shave away some of the thickened skin to relieve pain and pressure in the affected area. Although many people can do this themselves, podiatrists and other foot specialists can make sure the procedure is done safely. Your doctor also may recommend that you modify your footwear to prevent your problem from returning. For example, pads or \"donuts\" made of moleskin, lamb's wool, foam or felt will cushion the affected area. Corrective shoe inserts will redistribute the forces that cause friction and pressure inside your shoes, relieving some of the stress on your feet when you walk.\nYour doctor may ask you to return regularly to have your feet examined and your corns and calluses shaved, if necessary.\nYou also can minimize corns and calluses by regularly rubbing them with a pumice stone, which is available in most drug stores.\nAfter the corn or callus is shaved down, application of salicylic acid plasters or pads (available over-the-counter) can be helpful.  However, this treatment should not be used by people with nerve disease (neuropathy) or circulation problems in the feet.\nIn rare cases, foot surgery may be necessary to treat corns and calluses that keep returning and are not relieved by padding, shoe inserts and periodic shaving. Never try to shave or cut a corn or callus on your own. Instead, use a pumice stone to trim it down safely.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment to see your family doctor, orthopedic surgeon or podiatrist if you have painful corns or calluses.\nIf you have diabetes or poor circulation, examine your feet every day. For the best view, use a mirror to inspect the soles of your feet and the skin folds between your toes. If you see an area of redness, swelling, bleeding, blisters or any other problem, call your doctor promptly.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although corns and calluses tend to return even if they are removed, this may be less likely if you use foot padding and shoe inserts.\n",

      "What is coronary artery disease (CAD)?": "The most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease (CAD), narrowing of coronary arteries. These are the blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. The condition is also called coronary heart disease (CHD).\nCAD is usually caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of cholesterol plaque inside the coronary arteries. These plaques are made up of fatty deposits, inflammatory cells, calcium, and fibrous tissue.\nWith narrowed arteries, flow of oxygen-rich blood to heart muscle slows. At rest, blood supply might be sufficient. But during exercise or periods of emotional stress, inadequate blood flow in a coronary artery can cause a type of chest pain called angina.\nAtherosclerosis also can lead to rupture of the cholesterol plaque, which then triggers formation of a blood clot inside a narrowed coronary artery. Sudden stoppage of blood flow in a coronary artery usually leads to heart attack, causing significant damage to the heart.\nThe risk factors for atherosclerosis and CAD are basically the same. These risk factors include:\nCAD is the most common chronic, life-threatening illness in most of the world's developed nations.\n",
      "Symptoms of coronary artery disease": "In most people, the most common symptom of CAD is angina. Angina, also called angina pectoris, is a type of chest pain.\nAngina usually is described as a squeezing, pressing or burning chest pain. It tends to be felt mainly in the center of the chest or just below the center of the rib cage. It also can spread to the arms (especially the left arm), upper abdomen, neck, lower jaw, or neck.\nOther symptoms can include:\nA patient may mistake heart symptoms, such as burning chest pain and nausea, for indigestion.\nThere are two types of chest pain related to CAD. They are stable angina and acute coronary syndrome.\nStable angina.In stable angina, chest pain follows a predictable pattern. It usually occurs after:\nSymptoms usually last one to five minutes. They disappear after a few minutes of rest. Stable angina is caused by a smooth plaque. This plaque partially obstructs blood flow in one or more coronary arteries.\nAcute coronary syndrome(ACS).ACS is much more dangerous. In most cases of ACS, fatty plaque inside an artery has developed a tear or break. The uneven surface can cause blood to clot on top of the disrupted plaque. This sudden blockage of blood flow results in unstable angina or a heart attack.\nIn unstable angina, chest pain symptoms are more severe and less predictable than in stable angina. Chest pains occur more frequently, even at rest. They last several minutes to hours. People with unstable angina often sweat profusely. They develop aches in the jaw, shoulders and arms.\nMany people with CAD, especially women and those with diabetes, do not have any symptoms. Or, they have unusual symptoms. In these people, the only sign of CAD may be a change in the pattern of an electrocardiogram (EKG). An EKG is a test that records the heart's electrical activity.\nAn EKG can be done at rest or during exercise (exercise stress test). Exercise increases the heart muscle's demand for blood. The body can't meet this demand when the coronary arteries are significantly narrowed. When the heart muscle is starved for blood and oxygen, its electrical activity changes. This altered electrical activity affects the patient's EKG results.\nIn many people, the first symptom of coronary artery narrowing is a heart attack.\n",
      "Diagnosing coronary artery disease": "Coronary artery disease usually is diagnosed after a person has chest pain or other symptoms. However, screening for CAD with imaging is being done more commonly and can detect symptomatic disease earlier.\nYour doctor will examine you, paying special attention to your chest and heart. Your doctor will press on your chest to see if it is tender. Tenderness could be a sign of a non-cardiac problem. Your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for any abnormal heart sounds.\nYour doctor will do one or more diagnostic tests to look for CAD. Possible tests include:\n",
      "Expected duration of coronary artery disease": "CAD is a long-term condition. People can have different patterns of symptoms.\nPlaque in coronary arteries never will disappear completely. However, with diet, exercise and medication, the amount of cholesterol in the plaque can be reduced, and replaced with fibrous tissue, thereby stabilizing the plaques and making them less prone to rupture so they won't cause a heart attack. In addition, medication to lower heart rate and blood pressure can allow the demand for blood flow by the heart muscle to match any decrease in blood flow.\nIn addition, sometimes new, small blood channels called collaterals can develop to increase the blood flow to the heart muscle.\n",
      "Preventing coronary artery disease": "You can help to prevent CAD by controlling your risk factors for atherosclerosis. To do this:\n",
      "Treating coronary artery disease": "CAD caused by atherosclerosis is treated with one or more of the following treatments.\n",
      "Lifestyle changes": "Lifestyle changes include:\n",
      "Medications": "Cholesterol-lowering medications.The choice of medication depends upon your cholesterol profile.\nTwo classes of medications, niacin and fibrates, have been foundnotto reduce heart attacks and are no longer recommended for prevention. Sometimes they are used for patients with very high triglycerides (andgt;500 mg/dl). Gemfibrozil (Lopid) and fenofibrate (Tricor, many generic versions) are fibrates.\nAspirin.Aspirin helps to prevent blood clots from forming inside narrowed coronary arteries. It reduces the risk of heart attack in people who already have CAD. For patients without known CAD but with risk factors, doctors will review a patient's individual risk and discuss with them the relative benefits of preventing a heart attack or stroke versus the risk of bleeding.\nOther types of anti-platelet drugs can be used instead of or in addition to aspirin, including clopidogrel (Plavix) and sometimes an anticoagulant (blood thinner) such as apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), or warfarin (Coumadin.\nBeta blockers. These medications decrease the heart's workload. They do this by slowing the heart rate. They also reduce the force of heart muscle contractions, especially during exercise. People who have had a heart attack should stay on a beta blocker for life. This will reduce the risk of a second heart attack. Atenolol (Tenormin) and metoprolol (Lopressor) are beta blockers.\nCalcium channel blockers.These medications may help to decrease the frequency of chest pain in patients with angina. Examples include nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), diltiazem (Cardizem), and verapamil.\nNitrates (including nitroglycerin).These medications are vasodilators, which means they widen the coronary arteries to increase blood flow to the heart muscle. They also widen the body's veins. This lightens the heart's workload by temporarily decreasing the volume of blood returning to the heart.\nRanolazine.Ranolazine (Ranexa) can be prescribed in patients who continue to have chest pain with exertion (stable angina) despite using all of the therapies listed above.\n",
      "Procedures": "Coronary artery angiography.Some people are physically limited by stable angina because of chest pain. In this case, your doctor likely will advise you to have a coronary artery angiography to look for significant blockages. This procedure is also called a cardiac catheterization.\nCoronary stenting.When one or more significant blockages are found, the cardiologist will determine if the blockage(s) can be opened. He or she will consider a procedure called coronary stenting, where a metal mesh stent is placed inside the blockage to open it up and keep it open. Sometimes only a balloon angioplasty is done. These procedures are also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nIn PCI, a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin or forearm. The catheter is threaded into the blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent, usually with a small balloon inside it, is inflated briefly to open the narrowed blood vessel. The wire mesh remains inside the artery to keep it open. The balloon is deflated and the catheter is removed.\nCoronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).If the blockages cannot be opened with balloon angioplasty, the cardiologist will likely suggest CABG.\nCABG involves grafting one or more blood vessels onto the coronary arteries. This allows blood to bypass the narrowed or blocked areas. The blood vessels to be grafted can be taken from an artery inside the chest or arm, or from a long vein in the leg.\n",
      "Treating heart attack or sudden worsening of angina": "The goal of treating heart attacks or sudden worsening of angina is to rapidly restore blood flow to the section of heart muscle no longer getting blood flow.\nPatients immediately receive:\nFor patients with a severe heart attack whose ECGs indicate a 100% blocked artery, patients are transferred immediately to a cardiac catheterization laboratory. There, they have an immediate angiography and coronary stenting of the most significant blockage. For other patients with acute coronary syndromes, the catheterization is usually done within the first few days.\nIn some people with CAD, other symptoms or complications will require additional treatment. For example, medication may be needed to treat abnormal heart rhythms or low blood pressure.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Seek emergency help immediately if you have chest pain. In patients whose chest pain signals heart attack, prompt treatment can limit heart muscle damage.\nDo not waste precious time hoping that your chest pain disappears.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In people with CAD, the outlook depends on many factors.\nPeople with stable angina who are taking medications regularly, eating properly and exercising as instructed by their doctors, generally remain active and have an excellent prognosis.\nThe prognosis for heart attacks when people reach the emergency room promptly has improved dramatically. However, many people still die before reaching the hospital. This is why it is so important to prevent CAD.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, fatal brain disorder caused by prions. Prions are normal proteins that have changed their shape. Healthy proteins have a healthy shape, which allows them to function normally.  The misshapen prion protein causes disease by making other proteins nearby change their healthy shape to the prion's unhealthy shape.  In this way one prion makes many more prions: it slowly turns healthy proteins into prions, too.\nWhen symptoms eventually appear, CJD causes rapidly progressive dementia (mental decline) and involuntary jerking muscle movements called myoclonus. About 90% of people with CJD die within 1 year of diagnosis.\nAbout 85-95% of cases of CJD are from sporadic mutations. The DNA that makes the prion protein is changed by the mutation. The slightly different DNA makes a slightly different protein that has an abnormal shape. Less often, the mutation is hereditary (passed down from parent to child). Jewish people born in Czechoslovakia, Chile and Libya have a higher-than-average risk of CJD from this inherited mutation. Inherited CJD does not cause symptoms until adulthood.\nPrions also can be passed from an animal to a person, or from one person to another.  Fortunately, it is hard to catch prion diseases.  A type of CJD called \"variant CJD\" shows somewhat slower progression of brain injury and more psychiatric symptoms, and it tends to affect younger people. This type of CJD has been linked to eating beef from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also called \"mad cow disease.\"  BSE is caused by prions.\nIn the 1990's, a small outbreak of variant CJD was described in the United Kingdom. It was caused by people eating beef infected with prions. Since then, changes in beef farming and processing practices have helped to limit the number of new cases.\nIt is extremely uncommon for CJD to spread from one person to another. However, in very rare cases CJD has been transmitted by a blood transfusion, by a medical procedure (because of contaminated equipment), by contaminated tissue (such as corneas that are used for transplant) or by injections of hormones extracted from human tissues.\n",
      "Symptoms": "CJD does not cause any symptoms at first. The first symptoms include slow thinking, difficulty concentrating, impaired judgment and memory loss.  These symptoms also occur with other diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, so CJD can be hard to diagnose, at first.\nSoon, however, begins a severe, progressive dementia. People neglect themselves, become apathetic or irritable, and start having strong muscle spasms. Then people become completely bedridden, and eventually lapse into coma. Comatose patients may die as a result of infection associated with being immobile, such as pneumonia.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The only sure way to diagnose CJD is with a brain biopsy, an invasive test.  A less invasive test, a spinal tap (or lumbar puncture) can reveal abnormal proteins in the spinal fluid. Detection of these proteins can help make the diagnosis, but the diagnosis is made primarily by the symptoms and the doctor's examination of the nervous system.\nOther non-invasive tests can be very helpful, however:\nComputed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may be done to look for atrophied (shrunken) brain tissue.\nElectroencephalogram (EEG), or brain wave, studies reveal a characteristic abnormality in 75% to 95% of people.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans also can provide helpful information.\nUsually a person's symptoms plus the results of non-invasive tests make the diagnosis clear.  Brain biopsy is done only if there is a possibility the patient may have another disorder that could be treated.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Ninety percent to 95% of people with CJD die within 3 to 12 months after symptoms start. A few people with the disease survive more than 2 years.\n",
      "Prevention": "Most cases of CJD cannot be prevented, but the disease fortunately is rare: only one person in one million develops the disease each year.\nCases of CJD caused by medical procedures, or by eating infected animal meat, are even more rare. But they are preventable. Health care professionals minimize the risk by handling the fluids and tissues of patients with CJD with extreme caution, and by using special sterilization methods to disinfect equipment. Likewise, new precautions have been taken by the beef farming and beef processing industry. These precautions have helped to make the risk of infection from eating beef exceedingly small.\nBlood banks have put additional restrictions on blood donors. Blood banks in the United States now turn away blood donations from people who have lived in the United Kingdom for three months or longer from 1980 through 1996.\n",
      "Treatment": "CJD cannot be cured, but some of the symptoms can be treated. Narcotics may be used to relieve pain, and anticonvulsant drugs, such as clonazepam (Klonopin) and valproic acid (Depacon, Depakene, Depakote), may be used for muscle spasms. Research studies are looking into other drugs that may be helpful.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Seek medical help for signs of dementia such as sudden or gradual changes in memory, thinking skills, mood or behavior and for alterations in vision or movement ability.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The disease is fatal, with the majority of deaths occurring within 3 to 12 months of illness.\n",

      "What is Crohn's disease?": "Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease in which inflammation injures the intestines. It is a long-term (chronic) condition. Crohn's disease typically begins between ages 15 and 40.\nNo one knows for sure what triggers the initial intestinal inflammation at the start of Crohn's disease. A viral or bacterial infection may start the process by activating the immune system in the intestine. However, the immune system attack is not turned off: it stays active and creates inflammation even after the infection goes away.\nCertain genes passed on from parent to child increase the risk of developing Crohn's disease, if the right trigger occurs.\nOnce Crohn's disease begins, it can cause lifelong symptoms that come and go. The inner lining of the intestine thickens, and can wear away. The deeper layers of the intestine also become inflamed. This creates ulcers, cracks and fissures. Inflammation can allow an abscess (a pocket of pus) to develop.\nA common complication of Crohn's disease is called a fistula. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two areas of the body; in Crohn's disease, the most common type is between two parts of the digestive tract, usually between one part of the intestine and another. A fistula can be created after inflammation becomes severe.\nThe section of the small intestine called the ileum is especially prone to damage from Crohn's disease. The ileum is located in the right lower abdomen. However, ulcers and inflammation can occur in all areas of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the rectum.\nA few other parts of the body, such as the eyes and joints, also can be affected by Crohn's disease.\n\n",
      "Symptoms of Crohn's disease": "Some people with Crohn's disease have only occasional cramps, or diarrhea. Their symptoms are so mild they do not seek medical attention.\nHowever, most people with Crohn's disease have more bothersome symptoms. They may experience long stretches of time with no symptoms. But these are interrupted by flare-ups of symptoms.\nWhen Crohn's disease first begins, or during a flare-up, you might experience:\n",
      "Diagnosing Crohn's disease": "If you have Crohn's disease, your symptoms and the results of various tests will usually fit a pattern over time that is highly suggestive of the diagosis. Even so, it may require months for your doctor to diagnose Crohn's disease with certainty.\nYour doctor will look for evidence of intestinal inflammation. He or she will try to distinguish it from other causes of intestinal problems such as infection or ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is another disease that, like Crohn's diseases, also causes intestinal inflammation.\nTest abnormalities that are often, but not always, found in people with Crohn's disease include:\n",
      "Expected duration of Crohn's disease": "Crohn's disease is a lifelong condition. But it is not continuously active.\nFollowing a flare-up, symptoms can stay with you for weeks or months. Often these flare-ups are separated by months or years of good health without any symptoms.\n",
      "Preventing Crohn's disease": "There is no way to prevent Crohn's disease.\nBut you can keep the condition from taking a heavy toll on your body. Maintain a well-balanced, nutritious diet to store up vitamins and nutrients between episodes or flare-ups. By doing so, you can decrease complications from poor nutrition, such as weight loss or anemia.\nAlso, do not smoke. Along with many other harmful health effects, smoking is a risk factor for developing Crohn's disease and is also linked to complications such as fistulas.\nCrohn's disease can increase your risk of getting colon cancer. Have your colon checked regularly for early cancerous or precancerous changes. Check with your doctor regarding which types of tests to have and how frequently to repeat them.\n",
      "Treating Crohn's disease": "Medications are very effective at improving the symptoms of Crohn's disease. Most of the drugs work by preventing inflammation in the intestines.\nFor mild disease, steroids and/or anti-inflammatory drugs called aminosalicylates (such as mesalamine or sulfasalazine) are usually tried first. Aminosalicylates are chemically related to aspirin. They suppress inflammation in the intestine. They are given either as pills by mouth or by rectum, as an enema. Certain antibiotics help by killing bacteria in irritated areas of the bowel if infection is suspected or confirmed.\nAntidiarrheal medications such as loperamide (Imodium) may be helpful if you have diarrhea.\nOther more powerful anti-inflammatory drugs, such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, may be helpful. But they can also suppress your immune system, increasing your risk of infections. For this reason, they are not often used on a long-term basis.  Combinations of these and some of the newer medications described below are commonly recommended.\nAmong the newest drugs approved for treatment of Crohn's disease are tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and other injectable treatments. TNF is a substance made by immune system cells that causes inflammation. TNF inhibitors have potentially very serious side effects. They are generally prescribed for moderate to severe Crohn's disease that is not responding to other therapies and may be taken in combination with other medications. Adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), and infliximab (Remicade) are TNF inhibitors that have been found to improve Crohn's disease. When TNF inhibitors are not effective, other injectable options include ustekinumab (Stelara), risankizumab (Skyrizi), and vedolizumab (Entyvio).\nSurgery to remove a section of the bowel is another possible treatment. In general, surgery is recommended only if a person has\n",
      "When to call a professional": "New or changing symptoms often mean that additional treatment is needed. People who have Crohn's disease should be in frequent contact with a doctor.\nOne serious complication is bowel obstruction. This occurs when the intestine becomes so narrowed that the digestive contents cannot pass through. Bowel obstruction causes vomiting or severe abdominal pain. It requires emergency treatment.\nOther symptoms that require a doctor's immediate attention are:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Crohn's disease can affect people very differently. Many people have only mild symptoms. They do not require continuous treatment with medication.\nOthers require multiple medications and develop complications. Crohn's disease improves with treatment. It is not usually a fatal illness. While it can be controlled in most cases, it cannot be cured.\nCrohn's disease requires people to pay special attention to their health needs and to seek frequent medical care. But it does not prevent most people from having normal jobs and productive family lives.\nIt can be helpful for a newly diagnosed person to seek advice from a support group of other people with the disease.\n",

      "What is croup?": "Croup is a common respiratory illness in children that causes a change in breathing with a hoarse voice and a brassy, barking cough. Doctors sometimes call croup laryngotracheitis because it usually involves inflammation of the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe).\n\nCroup often is divided into two broad categories:\nInfectious CroupInfectious croup is caused by an infection with a virus, bacterium or other germ. In the United States, most cases of croup are caused by a virus. These infections usually occur in the fall and winter when people spend more time indoors.\nUnder these conditions, the virus spreads easily through coughing and sneezing. It also can travel on dirty hands and on things that have had contact with fluids from a sick person's nose or mouth. These include used tissues, toys, drinking glasses and eating utensils.\nOnce the virus enters the body, it usually begins to attack the upper parts of the breathing system. For this reason, a child with croup may first complain of cold symptoms. These may include a runny nose or nasal congestion. The child also may have a low-grade fever or a mild sore throat.\nLater, the virus spreads farther down the throat. The linings of the voice box and windpipe become red, swollen, narrowed and irritated. This triggers hoarseness, a barking cough, and loud, raspy breathing (stridor).\nSpasmodic CroupSpasmodic croup is very similar to infectious croup. It can be triggered by infection, but it isn't caused by infection. It tends to run in families, and may be triggered by an allergic reaction.\nSpasmodic croup tends to come on suddenly, without fever. Sometimes it can be hard to tell spasmodic croup from infectious croup.\nInfectious croup is most common in children younger than age six. Spasmodic croup usually affects children who are between three months and three years old. Before the age of three months, a child's risk of either type of croup is fairly low.\n",
      "Symptoms of croup": "The classic symptom of croup is a harsh, brassy cough that sounds like a seal's bark. This cough is often worse at night. And it usually occurs with hoarseness and loud, raspy breathing.\nOther symptoms vary, depending on whether the illness is infectious croup or spasmodic croup.\nInfectious Croup\nChildren with infectious croup often have a low-grade fever and mild cold symptoms before a cough begins. In many cases, the sick child also has a history of being exposed to a family member, friend or classmate with a cough, runny nose or other signs of a respiratory infection.\nMost children with infectious croup are mildly ill and do not develop significant breathing problems.\nAmong the few who do develop more severe forms of the illness, symptoms can include:\nSpasmodic Croup\nA child with spasmodic croup often looks fairly healthy before coughing starts. Episodes of cough and loud, raspy breathing generally start without warning. They typically occur in the middle of the night.\nThese symptoms often will pass if the child is carried into cool night air or taken into a steamy bathroom.\nSymptoms from spasmodic croup usually improve within a few hours. However, it is common for the symptoms to reappear several nights in a row.\n",
      "Diagnosing croup": "The doctor will review your child's symptoms. He or she will ask whether your child has been exposed to anyone with a cough or cold.\nThe doctor also will review your child's immunizations for Haemophilus influenzae. Without these immunizations, this bacterium can cause epiglottitis. Epiglottis is a potentially life-threatening infection that can suddenly block the windpipe. Symptoms of epiglottitis can be similar to those of croup.\nUsually, your child's doctor can diagnose croup based on your child's history, symptoms and a physical examination.\nIf your child's symptoms are severe or unusual, X-rays or other tests may be needed. These tests will check for more severe illnesses of the lungs or throat, including epiglottitis.\nRarely, when a child has severe breathing difficulties, hospital care is necessary.\n",
      "Expected duration of croup": "Symptoms of infectious croup usually go away within three to five days. However, some children have a mild cough that lasts a bit longer.\nSpasmodic croup tends to recur. The period between episodes is very variable.\n",
      "Preventing croup": "To help prevent viral infections that can cause croup:\n",
      "Treating croup": "Your doctor probably will recommend actions to make breathing easier until the infection goes away.\nThese include:\nMost children with croup have mild forms of the illness that can be treated at home. In particular, spasmodic croup often improves dramatically with only a cool mist vaporizer.\nIn rare cases, a child with croup can develop severe breathing problems that must be treated in a hospital. There, the child may receive oxygen, epinephrine (a drug that opens the airways), corticosteroids and other measures to aid breathing. If there is any concern for a bacterial infection, the child will also be treated with antibiotics.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If your child appears to have severe breathing problems, either call for emergency help immediately, or take your child to an emergency room.\nSome danger signs to watch for include:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The majority of children with croup recover fully without complications.\n",

      "What is curvature of the penis (Peyronie's Disease)?": "Peyronie's disease is a curve in the penis.\nMany men have a slight curve in the penis. As long as there is no pain or problem with sexual performance, men with a slightly curved penis should not be concerned. They do not need to see a doctor.\nHowever, some men develop a more serious bend in the penis. This bend interferes with sexual function or causes pain.\nThis occasionally happens after the penis is injured. Injury may occur during intercourse or from a motor vehicle or industrial accident. Most cases, however, are the result of a poorly understood process known as Peyronie's disease.\n\nIn Peyronie's disease, inflammation and scar tissue form along the shaft of the penis. No one is certain why this problem occurs. It may be triggered by repeated mild trauma during sexual intercourse.\nYou may feel the inflammation and scar tissue as a painful lump or area of unusual firmness. In many men, the scar tissue causes the penis to bend or shorten. This is because it prevents the penis from expanding normally.\nMen with Peyronie's often have difficulty achieving a firm erection. But it is unclear whether this occurs first or is caused by the scar tissue.\nMost men with the problem are between the ages of 45 and 60. The disease runs in families.\nIn one-third of men, Peyronie's is associated with the formation of scar tissue in other parts of the body. These include the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet and the eardrums.\nSometimes, a serious curvature of the penis is seen in boys at or shortly after birth. This is not Peyronie's disease. Most of these cases are thought to be caused by abnormal development in the womb. They may be associated with other abnormalities of the penis.\n",
      "Symptoms of Peyronie's Disease": "About half of men with Peyronie's disease will first notice pain during intercourse. Symptoms may appear suddenly, or may develop slowly over time. Often the penis will feel firm or lumpy at the painful site.\nOther men with Peyronie's will notice a painless curve of the penis that can occur suddenly or get worse over time. The penis may curve up, down or to either side. Severe changes in the shape of the penis may prevent the man from having intercourse.\nIf the penis has been injured by sudden trauma, most men will be able to recall the event. Often there will be a sensation or sound of a \"snap\" followed by loss of erection and the appearance of a bruise. Part of the penis will remain painful for a time. But usually the area will heal over time. However, scar tissue may form and cause a new curvature. This problem is different from Peyronie's. It rarely results in difficulties with erections or shortening of the penis.\n",
      "Diagnosing Peyronie's Disease": "Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. He will examine your penis, looking for tender, firm areas of scar tissue. Usually, this is all that is needed to diagnose the problem.\nIf your doctor needs more information, he or she may order an X-ray to look for calcium deposits in scar tissue. Your doctor may ask you to bring in photographs of your erect penis to better determine the extent of the damage.\nMen who are considering surgery may be asked to undergo special testing of sexual function. This will help determine the best method of repairing the problem.\n",
      "Expected duration of Peyronie's Disease": "A curve in the penis that is present since birth or is caused by scarring from an injury will not go away unless it is corrected with surgery.\nHow long Peyronie's disease lasts is difficult to predict. In more than a third of men, there is gradual improvement over 12 to 18 months without any specific treatment. In others, the scarring is permanent or worsens over time.\n",
      "Preventing Peyronie's Disease": "There is no way to prevent Peyronie's disease.\nHowever, middle-aged men who engage in more vigorous or frequent intercourse appear more likely to develop Peyronie's.\n",
      "Treating Peyronie's Disease": "Most men with curvature of the penis do not need any treatment. This is true regardless of the cause.\nMen with Peyronie's disease who experience pain or difficulty with intercourse may be offered treatment with oral pentoxifylline first. Alternatively, the doctor may suggest penile injections with collagenase or verapamil.\nCorrective surgery may be offered to men with more bothersome or disfiguring symptoms that persist for more than one year. It's important to make sure that the disease is not active at the time of surgery. So, surgery should be delayed for at least three months after the condition is clearly stable.\nIn a typical procedure, the inflamed or scarred portion of tissue is removed from the penis. It is replaced with a graft taken from another part of the body (often the scrotum or forearm).\nThis surgery often works well. However, mild curvature of the penis may remain. In addition, sexual function or shortening of the penis may not improve following surgery.\nFor this reason, surgeons sometimes implant a penile prosthesis during surgery. In some men, a prosthesis alone is enough to straighten the curvature and improve sexual function. Men who are considering surgery should be sure to discuss all the options with their physicians.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Some men with Peyronie's disease improve without treatment. Other men have mild symptoms that can be tolerated. Because they do not interfere with sexual activity, these men may choose not to seek treatment.\nOnly a minority of men eventually will require surgery.\nPeyronie's disease does not develop into cancer or other serious conditions.\n",

      "What is cytomegalovirus (CMV)?": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus. It is so common that almost all adults in developing countries and 50% to 85% of adults in the United States have been infected.\nUsually CMV is a mild disease that does not cause any serious problems in healthy children and adults. Most people get flu-like symptoms or an illness similar to mononucleosis, if they develop symptoms at all.\nBeing infected with this virus can be serious and even fatal in some people, however, including:\nWomen infected with CMV for the first time during pregnancy can pass the virus to their unborn babies in the womb. The virus can also pass from mother to baby in vaginal secretions during delivery and in breast milk after birth. The virus can pass from person to person through close personal contact, sexual contact, blood transfusion or organ transplantation.\n",
      "Symptoms of CMV": "There are three classes of CMV infection, each with different symptoms:\n",
      "Congenital": "Up to 40% of babies born to women who are newly infected with CMV during pregnancy will become infected. Not all infected babies will have symptoms at birth. This type of CMV infection causes as much serious disability as Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome and neural tube defects.\nNewborns with CMV are likely to be born premature and at a low birth weight. Other possible problems include a small brain (microcephaly) or other nervous system disorders that can cause seizures, deafness, intellectual disabilities or death. This infection can cause the liver and spleen to become larger than normal, yellowing of the skin and eyes (from liver disease), and blood disorders. Newborns with CMV can have a rash that consists of small bruises called petechiae and larger bruises known as purpura.\nA baby born to a mother who was already infected with CMV before she became pregnant is less likely to be born with CMV. Only 0.5% to 1.5% of such babies are infected (compared to 40% of babies born to mothers who were infected during pregnancy), and their problems tend to be less severe.\n",
      "Healthy people": "In most cases, healthy people who become infected with CMV usually develop minor symptoms or no symptoms at all. When symptoms occur, they are similar to the symptoms of mononucleosis:\nThe virus usually becomes inactive (latent or dormant) in healthy people without specific treatment. CMV is never completely cleared from the body, however, and can reactivate in situations such as immune suppression.\n",
      "Immune-suppressed people": "People who have had an organ or bone marrow transplant and those with AIDS can develop serious illness caused by CMV. Typically, latent virus from a previous infection (the original CMV infection may have occurred many years earlier) becomes active again because the person's immune system is weakened. People with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of becoming very ill if they never had CMV in the past and acquire a new infection.\nReactivated CMV infection can affect many parts of the body:\n",
      "Diagnosing CMV": "Doctors may order blood tests for babies with low birth weight, jaundice, small brains or other problems that can be associated with congenital CMV, but can also be caused by other things. The diagnosis needs to be confirmed by testing blood or tissue from the infant within three weeks of birth.\nYoung, healthy adults usually do not need to be tested because they do not need to be treated specifically for CMV. They usually recover over a period of weeks. In some instances, blood tests may be done to confirm the cause of the illness, since similar symptoms can be caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and even human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Tests may also be needed to monitor blood levels and liver inflammation. Occasionally, ultrasound testing is needed to monitor the liver or spleen.\nFor people with HIV/AIDS who have a severely weakened immune system, or for people who have had an organ or bone marrow transplant, the diagnosis of CMV usually requires a detailed physical exam and blood tests. Depending on the symptoms, urine and stool samples may be tested. Sometimes, a biopsy of the affected organ, such as the lung or colon, is needed to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration of CMV": "Disease progression in babies who are infected in the womb, during birth or through breastfeeding may vary a great deal. Some babies may die from the infection and some may have no long-lasting effects at all. Prognosis depends on many factors and these babies should be seen by a specialist.\nAdults with a healthy immune system who are already infected with CMV can expect the virus to remain inactive. No further symptoms related to CMV are expected to develop.\nA person with a weakened immune system who develops CMV-related disease (either primary infection or reactivation) will often need lengthy treatment. Improving the immune system is the best hope for combating any invading viruses.\n",
      "Preventing CMV": "Pregnant women who care for young children should:\nIf you are pregnant and work in a day care center, reduce your risk of getting CMV by working with children who are older than 2 and a half years of age, especially if you have never been infected with CMV or are unsure if you have been exposed.\nIn some cases, people with AIDS or those who have had an organ or bone marrow transplant may need to take medication to prevent CMV reactivation. If people with weakened immune systems need blood transfusions, they will probably receive blood that has had the white blood cells removed. This lowers the risk of infection.\nAlso, it is essential for people with HIV/AIDS who have extremely weakened immune systems to schedule regular eye exams to detect CMV early, even before symptoms develop. This can help to avoid the loss of vision.\n",
      "Treating CMV": "The treatment of babies infected with CMV depends on the type and severity of symptoms. Treatment should be provided by a specialist on a case-by-case basis.\nHealthy people generally do not need any specific treatment for CMV.\nAlthough there is no cure for CMV, organ transplant recipients, people with AIDS and others with immune disorders may need treatment to suppress the latent infection. Treatment for CMV may include trying to correct the underlying immune disorder. For example, experience in treating people with AIDS shows that when a person's immune system improves, CMV-related conditions can improve.\nDrugs used to treat CMV include ganciclovir (Cytovene or Vitrasert), valganciclovir (Valcyte), cidofovir (Vistide) and foscarnet (Foscavir).\nSide effects of ganciclovir and valganciclovir include the suppression of white blood cells (needed to fight infection), red blood cells (that carry oxygen) and platelets (that help the blood to clot). Because cidofovir and foscarnet can cause kidney damage, kidney function needs to be monitored carefully.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "A doctor should see your baby if he or she has yellow skin (jaundice), hearing problems, rash, fever, seizures or vomiting. If you are a healthy adult, call your doctor if you have severe abdominal pain, vomiting or fevers that last longer than 48 hours or if you have significant fatigue, sweats, chills or are losing weight.\nIf you have a weakened immune system, see a doctor if you have visual changes, mental changes, difficulty or pain with swallowing, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea, cough, fever or difficulty breathing.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In babies, consequences can last a lifetime or be fatal. In healthy people, CMV is almost always mild and goes away on its own. People with weakened immune systems can lose their vision or have life-threatening and disabling illnesses that can require lifelong therapy to prevent these complications.\n",

      "What is dandruff?": "Dandruff is a condition in which dead skin cells are shed from the scalp in large enough amounts to be noticeable. When these dead cells stick together, often because of surface debris and oil in the hair, they are noticeable as flakes in the scalp and on clothing.\nDandruff is a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis of unknown cause. It is more of a nuisance and a cosmetic problem than a medical one.\n",
      "Symptoms of dandruff": "Symptoms include flakes of dead skin, itching and scaling on the scalp.\n",

      "Expected duration of dandruff": "Dandruff is a chronic (long-lasting) condition that comes and goes. It may disappear or be less severe in the warmer months.\n",
      "Preventing dandruff": "Although there is no way to prevent dandruff, regular use of an anti-dandruff shampoo can control the problem. For example, avoid frequent use of a hair dryer.\n",
      "Treating dandruff": "There are many effective shampoos on the market to control dandruff. Look for active ingredients such as selenium, zinc pyrithione, ciclopirox, or ketoconazole. Most shampoos work best if they are left on for several minutes after lathering and then rinsed out thoroughly. Reapply if directed. If over-the-counter products are not effective enough, a prescription medication such as a topical steroid may be recommended.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If dandruff symptoms persist or worsen — with severe flaking, itching, scaling or redness — see a doctor for more intensive therapy.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Dandruff is usually a chronic condition, so it will tend to come back. Use an antidandruff shampoo once or a twice a week to help control it.\n",

      "What is it?": "Decompression sickness, also called generalized barotrauma or the bends, refers to injuries caused by a rapid decrease in the pressure that surrounds you, of either air or water. It occurs most commonly in scuba or deep-sea divers, although it also can occur during high-altitude or unpressurized air travel. However, decompression sickness is rare in pressurized aircraft, such as those used for commercial flights.\nWhen you scuba dive with compressed air, you take in extra oxygen and nitrogen. Your body uses the oxygen, but the nitrogen is dissolved into your blood, where it remains during your dive. As you swim back toward the surface after a deep dive, the water pressure around you decreases.\nIf this transition occurs too quickly, the nitrogen does not have time to clear from your blood. Instead, it separates out of your blood and forms bubbles in your tissues or blood. It is these nitrogen bubbles that cause decompression sickness. The condition is called the bends because the joint and bone pains can be so severe they double you over.\nWhat happens inside your body during decompression sickness is similar to what happens when you open a carbonated drink. When you open the can or bottle, you decrease the pressure surrounding the beverage in the container, which causes the gas to come out of the liquid in the form of bubbles. If nitrogen bubbles form in your blood, they can damage blood vessels and block normal blood flow.\nFactors that put you at higher risk of decompression sickness include:\nSomeone with an abnormal hole or opening in the heart from a birth defect is at especially high risk of developing serious symptoms from decompression illness. Because bubbles create high blood pressure in the lungs, blood and bubbles from your veins may flow more readily through the heart's opening. This means your blood can re-circulate into arteries without first getting oxygen. An opening in the heart can also allow a relatively large air bubble (called an air embolism) to circulate into your arteries. An air embolism can cause a stroke.\nPeople with asthma or another lung disease may have thin-walled air pockets in their lungs called bullae. These pockets do not empty quickly when the persons exhales. As they return to the surface after a deep dive, air in the bullae may expand. If a bulla ruptures, it could cause a collapsed lung or allow a large air bubble (air embolism) to enter the arteries.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of decompression sickness include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your diving history and symptoms are key factors in diagnosing decompression sickness. Blood tests and joint X-rays usually do not show any signs of the problem.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Joint pain, the most common symptom from decompression sickness, can last for days or weeks.\n",
      "Prevention": "To minimize the risk of decompression sickness while diving:\nSome people should avoid diving altogether, or should consider special risks. If you have a heart defect, it is not safe to dive. If you have asthma, a history of a ruptured lung at any time in your life or another lung disease, discuss diving safety with a doctor before deciding whether to dive. A person who requires insulin to treat diabetes may have wide swings in blood glucose levels during a dive, and caution is advised. Avoid diving if you have a groin hernia that has not been repaired, since expanding gas in the hernia can cause symptoms.\n",
      "Treatment": "Emergency treatment for decompression sickness involves maintaining blood pressure and administering high-flow oxygen. Fluids also may be given. The person should be placed left side down and if possible the head of the bed tilted down.\nThe optimal treatment is the use of a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, which is a high-pressure chamber in which the patient receives 100% oxygen. This treatment reverses the pressure changes that allowed gas bubbles to form in the blood stream. The treatment drives nitrogen back into its liquid form so that it can be cleared more gradually from the body over a period of hours.\nIt is not recommended that divers with decompression sickness attempt to treat themselves with deep diving.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience symptoms of decompression sickness after scuba diving or flying, get to a doctor as soon as you can. Hyperbaric treatment is most successful if given within several hours after symptoms start.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most cases of decompression sickness respond well to a single treatment with hyperbaric oxygen. Your doctor may suggest repeated treatments if you continue to experience symptoms, especially neurological symptoms.\n",

      "What is it?": "Delusional disorder is characterized as having one or more false beliefs based on an incorrect interpretation of reality lasting at least one month. Other than the delusions, the person usually appears to function normally. Delusions can occur as part of many different psychiatric disorders. But the term delusional disorder is used when delusions are the most prominent symptom.\nA person with this illness holds a false belief firmly, despite clear evidence or proof to the contrary. Delusions may involve circumstances thatcouldoccur in reality even though they are unlikely (for example, the family next door plotting to kill you). Or they may be considered bizarre (for example, feeling controlled by an outside force or having thoughts inserted into your head). A religious or cultural belief that is accepted by other members of the person's community is not a delusion.\nThere are several types of delusions: persecutory, erotomatic, grandiose, jealous, or somatic (that is, delusions about the body). People with delusional disorder usually do not have hallucinations or a major problem with mood. Unlike people with schizophrenia, they tend not to have major problems with day-to-day functioning. Other than behaviors related to delusional content, they do not appear odd.\nWhen hallucinations do occur, they are part of the delusional belief. For example, someone who has the delusion that internal organs are rotting may hallucinate smells or sensations related to that delusion.\nIf functioningisimpaired, it is usually a direct result of the delusion. Therefore, the disorder may be detected only by observing behavior that is a consequence of the belief. For example, a person who fears being murdered may quit a job or stay home with all the shades drawn, never venturing out.\nSince people with delusional disorder are aware that their beliefs are unique, they generally do not talk about them. Delusional disorder is diagnosed much less frequently than schizophrenia.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptom is a persistent delusion or delusions (a fixed belief) — for example, about a situation, condition, or action – that is not happening but may be plausible in real life. Types include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Since delusional disorder is rare, a doctor should evaluate the possibility that another major illness, such as schizophrenia, a mood disorder, or a medical problem, is causing the symptoms. Medical causes should be considered, especially later in life. People who develop dementia (for example, Alzheimer's disease) can become delusional.\nMaking a diagnosis is more difficult when the person with the disorder conceals his or her thoughts. Because the person is convinced of the reality of his or her ideas, he or she may not want treatment. If the person allows it, conversations with supportive family or friends can help. A general medical evaluation is useful. In a few cases, when a medical or neurological problem is suspected, diagnostic tests such as an electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scans may be suggested.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long this illness lasts varies a lot. Some people have a persistent delusion that comes and goes in its intensity and significance. In some, the disorder will last only a few months.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no known way to prevent this disorder.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment for this disorder is challenging, especially if the delusion is long-lasting. Antipsychotic medications can be helpful, but delusions sometimes do not get better with pharmacological treatment. Since patients may not believe they have a mental disorder, they may refuse all treatment, including psychotherapy. However, support, reassurance, and pointing out the difference between the symptoms and reality can all be helpful if the person is willing to meet with a therapist. Educating the family about how to respond to the person's needs can be useful.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call the person's primary care doctor, a psychiatrist, or other mental health professional as soon as the problem is detected.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook varies. Although the disorder can go away after a short time, delusions also can persist for months or years. The inherent reluctance of a person with this disorder to accept treatment makes the prognosis worse. However, people with this disorder retain many areas of functioning, so some do reasonably well with limited assistance.\n",

      "What is dementia?": "Dementia is a pattern of mental decline caused by different diseases or conditions. Most commonly, dementia occurs when brain nerve cells (neurons) die, and connections between neurons are interrupted. These disruptions have a variety of causes and usually cannot be reversed.\nAlzheimer's disease causes over 60% of all dementias. Vascular disease, such as stroke, is the second most common cause. Lewy body disease, which causes neurons in the brain to degenerate, causes another 20% of dementias.\nOther conditions that can cause dementia include:\nIn rare cases, dementia is caused by a treatable condition, and it may be partially or entirely reversed if the condition is diagnosed and treated early:\nIn the developed nations, about 15% of people older than 65 are thought to have dementia.\n",
      "Symptoms of dementia": "Symptoms of dementia emerge slowly, get worse over time and limit the person's ability to function.\nThe first symptom of dementia is memory loss. Everyone has memory lapses from time to time. However, the memory loss of dementia is greater and affects your ability to function. For example, forgetting where you put your car key is normal. Forgetting how to use the key is a possible symptom of dementia.\nOften, someone with dementia does not realize that he or she has a problem. Instead, family members recognize that something is wrong.\nAlong with memory loss, a person with dementia may have trouble with complex mental tasks. They may have difficulty balancing a checkbook, driving, knowing what day it is and learning new things. They may be inattentive, and display poor judgment. Their mood and behavior also may change.\nAs the disorder progresses, the person may have difficulty speaking in full sentences. They may not recognize their surroundings, or other people. They may have problems with personal care, such as bathing. In some cases, a person with dementia may see or hear things that are not (hallucinations and delusions). They may get very agitated, and may withdraw from other people.\n",
      "Diagnosing dementia": "The doctor will ask when memory problems started and how quickly they got worse. This information, together with the person's age, can help suggest a likely diagnosis. For example:\nHowever, the exact cause of dementia in any individual can often be difficult to determine.\nTo diagnose dementia, a doctor looks to see if a person's memory gets progressively worse, along with at least one of the following:\nDoctors test people by testing memory and attention. A commonly used tool to screen for dementia is the Mini Mental State Exam. It consists of 11 short assessments, such as asking the person what day and year it is or have the person count backward from 100 by sevens (100, 93, 86, etc.). If the person answers correctly, dementia is less likely.\nLaboratory tests can narrow down the possible causes. Some tests include:\n",
      "Expected duration of dementia": "In most cases, dementia gets worse and cannot be cured. A person with dementia may live for months, years or decades, depending on the cause of the dementia and whether the person has other medical conditions.\nIn the rare cases in which dementia is caused by a treatable condition, such as infection, metabolic disorder or depression, the dementia usually is reversed after treatment.\n",
      "Preventing dementia": "Most of the causes of dementia cannot be prevented. Good personal health habits and medical care, however, can prevent some types of dementia. Here are some things you can do:\nKeeping your mind active and your body fit may help to prevent mental decline and reduce or postpone memory loss. If you get daily physical exercise and continue to challenge your brain throughout life, you can help to protect your brain against mental decline.\n",
      "Treating dementia": "Sometimes the cause of dementia can be reversed, such as vitamin B12deficiency or an underactive thyroid. Treating these conditions may improve the dementia. Other reversible factors that can contribute to symptoms include overuse of alcohol and depression.\nPeople with vascular dementia may show less mental decline if their blood pressure is controlled, they stop smoking, lower LDL (andquot;bad\" cholesterol), exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight.\nIn some people, medications for Alzheimer's may help with behavioral symptoms and perhaps slow down the mental decline. They may delay the need for placement into a nursing home. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne) and rivastigmine (Exelon), can be prescribed for mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia. Memantine (Namenda) is approved for moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia.\nThese same medications are sometimes used to treat the dementia associated with Lewy body disease.\nTwo new treatments for Alzheimer's disease using monoclonal antibodies directed against brain amyloid beta have been granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are aducanumab (Aduhelm) and lecanemab-irmb (Leqembi), which may slow and even potentially halt progression of the disease.\nDepending on the cause of the dementia, several specialists may be involved in care, including neurologists, psychologists, psychiatrists or geriatric doctors. Nurses and social workers play a very important role in care.\nHere are some easy to implement aspects of care that help ease symptoms:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for dementia depends on the cause and can vary by individual. For example, early treatment of dementia caused by a vitamin deficiency can lead to full recovery of memory. If stroke is the cause, the person's memory loss can remain stable for years.\nDrugs may slow the rate of decline for some people with Alzheimer's disease.\nIn most cases, however, the disorder gradually gets worse. Depending on the cause, the person's age, general health and the availability of treatments, life expectancy can be as short as a few months or as long as 15 to 20 years.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you or a loved one is having difficulty with any of the following:\nA person with dementia may also exhibit the following types of behaviors:\n",

      "What is it?": "Depression is more than just a passing blue mood, a \"bad day,\" or temporary sadness. The most common symptom is a low mood that can sometimes appear as irritability. Often the person with depression is not able to enjoy activities that he or she normally enjoys.\nIn major depression, people experience profound sadness, a sense of despair, or a loss of enjoyment. The symptoms of major depression are defined as lasting at least two weeks, but usually they go on much longer.\nAnother type of depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (previously known as dysthymia), has fewer symptoms than an episode of major depression, but lasts much longer (at least two years in adults and at least one year in children and adolescents). Many people with this disorder describe having been depressed as long as they can remember, or feeling as though they go in and out of depression all the time.\nA variety of symptoms usually accompany the low mood of any type of depression. And the symptoms can vary significantly among different people.\nMany people with depression also have anxiety. They may worry more than average about their physical health. They may have excessive conflict in their relationships or function poorly at work. Sexual functioning may be a problem. People with depression are also at more risk for abusing alcohol or other substances.\nDepression probably involves changes in the areas of the brain that control mood. The nerve cells may be functioning poorly in certain regions of the brain. Altered communication between nerve cells or nerve circuits can make it harder for a person's brain to regulate his or her mood.\nHormone changes may also negatively affect mood. An individual's life experiences can affect these biological processes. And a person's genetic makeup influences how vulnerable he or she is to experiencing depression.\nAn episode of depression can be triggered by a stressful life event. But in many cases, depression does not appear to be related to a specific event.\nA major depressive episode may occur within the first year after giving birth to a baby. In that case, it may be called major depressive disorder with peripartum onset. Most people refer to it as postpartum depression.\nDepression that occurs mainly during the winter months is usually called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It also may be called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern.\nEpisodes of depression can occur at any age. Depression is diagnosed in women twice as often as in men. People who have a family member with major depression are more likely to develop depression or drinking problems.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A depressed person may gain or lose weight, eat more or less than usual, have difficulty concentrating, and have trouble sleeping or sleep more than usual. He or she may feel tired and have no energy for work or play. Small burdens or obstacles may appear impossible to manage. The person can appear slowed down, or agitated and restless. The symptoms can be quite noticeable to others.\nA particularly painful symptom of this illness is an unshakable feeling of worthlessness and guilt. The person may feel guilty about a specific life experience, or may feel general guilt not related to anything in particular.\nIf pain and self-criticism become great enough, they can lead to feelings of hopelessness, self-destructive behavior, or thoughts of death and suicide. The vast majority of people who suffer severe depression do not attempt or complete suicide, but they are more likely to do so than people who are not depressed.\nSymptoms of major depression include:\nPeople with persistent depressive disorder may have many of the same symptoms, although fewer symptoms are needed to make the diagnosis, and these symptoms are long-lasting.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A primary care physician or a mental health professional usually can diagnose depression by asking questions about a person's medical history and symptoms.\nMany people with depression do not seek evaluation or treatment because of society's attitudes about depression. The person may feel the depression is his or her fault or may worry about what others will think. Also, the depression itself may distort a person's ability to recognize the problem. Therefore, family members or friends may need to encourage someone showing symptoms of depression to seek help.\nThere are no specific tests for depression. However, it is important to be evaluated by a primary care physician to make sure the symptoms are not being caused by a medical condition or medication.\n",
      "Expected duration": "On average, untreated episodes last several months. However, episodes of major depression can last any length of time. Symptoms can also vary in intensity during an episode.\nIf depression is not treated, it can become chronic (long-lasting). Treatment can shorten the length and severity of a depressive episode.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent major depression, but detecting the first signs of depression early can help, as increasing physical activity, prioritizing sleep, and other lifestyle changes can improve symptoms. Treatment can both reduce symptoms and help to prevent the illness from returning.\n",
      "Treatment": "The most helpful treatment is a combination of psychotherapy and medication. A medication from a class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is often prescribed first. These medications include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro). They are not without problems, but they are fairly easy to take and relatively safe compared with previous generations of antidepressants.\nSSRIs are known to cause problems with sexual functioning, some nausea, and an increase in anxiety in the early stages of treatment.\nOther effective antidepressants include bupropion (Wellbutrin), venlafaxine (Effexor), mirtazapine (Remeron), and duloxetine (Cymbalta). Two older classes of antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are also still in use. They are as effective as the newer ones and can be very useful when someone has not responded well to other treatments.\nIt usually takes at least two to six weeks of taking an antidepressant to see improvement. It may take several attempts to find the medication that works best. Once the right medication is found, it may take up to a few months to find a proper dose and for the full positive effect to be seen.\nSometimes, two different antidepressants are used together. Or a mood stabilizer, such as lithium (sold under several brand names) or valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote), is added. If psychotic symptoms are present, a doctor may prescribe an antipsychotic medication. These include haloperidol (Haldol), risperidone (Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), and olanzapine (Zyprexa).\nA number of different psychotherapy techniques have been demonstrated to be helpful, depending on the causes of the depression, the availability of family and other social support, and an individual's personal style and preference. A technique called cognitive behavioral therapy can help a depressed person recognize negative thinking and teach techniques for controlling symptoms. Other types of therapy, including psychodynamic, insight-oriented, and interpersonal psychotherapy, can help depressed people to sort out conflicts in important relationships or explore the history behind symptoms.\nIf you suffer from depression, you will benefit from learning all you can about the illness. You can also make use of any support networks that may be available in your community.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be a lifesaving option. In ECT, an electrical impulse is applied to the person's scalp and passes through to the brain, causing a seizure. The patient is under anesthesia for the entire procedure and is monitored carefully. Medication is given before the procedure to prevent any outward signs of convulsions, which helps to prevent injury. Improvement is seen gradually over a period of days to weeks after the treatment. ECT is the quickest and most effective treatment for the most severe forms of depression, and in most people, it is not any more risky than other antidepressant treatments.\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is another treatment for depression that is becoming more common. rTMS uses magnetic fields to alter brain function, possibly improving connections between neurons and changing how regions of the brain interact to influence mood.\n",
      "Antidepressants and suicide risk": "Since 2004, the FDA has required manufacturers of antidepressants to include a so-called \"black box warning\" on their product labeling. The warning is intended to address the concern that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in children, adolescents, and young adults. This problem has remained a focus of research, but the evidence surrounding it remains hard to interpret.\nA small number of young people taking these medications probably do have an unusual reaction and end up feeling much worse, rather than better. Any medication that affects mood can have an unexpected negative effect in some people.\nHowever, some experts worry that this warning has had too much of a chilling effect on the use of antidepressants for treatment. It is potentially dangerous for both doctors and patients to be too cautious about using a helpful intervention. When depression goes untreated, the risk of suicide goes up. Paradoxically, it is possible that the labeling putsmorepeople at risk for suicide if it means that some people do not receive the treatment they need.\nTherefore, independent of this debate, it is always important to monitor your treatment closely. No matter what age you are or what treatment you're getting, report any troubling symptoms or worsening mood to your doctor immediately.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Depression is a painful and potentially dangerous, but treatable, illness. You should contact a health care professional if you have any suspicion that you or a loved one is depressed.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Treatment of depression has become quite sophisticated and effective. The prognosis for treated depression is excellent. With treatment, the intensity of symptoms and the frequency of episodes often are significantly reduced. Many people recover completely.\nWhen treatment is successful, it is still important to stay in close touch with your doctor or therapist, because maintenance treatment is often required to prevent depression from returning.\n",

      "What are dermatofibromas?": "Dermatofibromas are small, noncancerous (benign) skin growths that can develop anywhere on the body but most often appear on the lower legs, upper arms or upper back. These nodules are common in adults but are rare in children. They can be pink, gray, red, or brown in color and may change color over the years. They are firm and often feel like a stone under the skin. When pinched from the sides, the top of the growth may dimple inward.\nDermatofibromas are usually painless, but some people experience tenderness or itching. Most often, a single nodule develops, but some people can develop many dermatofibromas. They rarely grow larger than a half-inch in diameter. The cause of dermatofibromas is unknown.\n",
      "Symptoms of dermatofibromas": "Dermatofibromas usually develop slowly. These small, hard, raised skin growths:\n",
      "Diagnosing dermatofibromas": "Most often, a doctor can diagnose a dermatofibroma by examining the nodule. If the growth does not look like a typical dermatofibroma, if a bleeding sore appears on its surface, or if the physician wants to be certain of the diagnosis, he or she will do a biopsy. A biopsy removes either part or all of the nodule for examination under a microscope.\n",
      "Expected duration of dermatofibromas": "Dermatofibromas do not go away on their own. Unless they are removed, the nodules remain for life.\n",
      "Preventing dermatofibromas": "Because no one knows what causes dermatofibromas, there is no way to prevent them.\n",
      "Treating dermatofibromas": "Dermatofibromas rarely require treatment. Some people may prefer to have their dermatofibromas removed if the growth is unsightly, is in an inconvenient location (such as in a place that repeatedly becomes nicked while shaving or is irritated by clothing), or is painful or itchy.\nBecause a dermatofibroma grows deep, removal requires excising it below the surface level of the skin. This process usually leaves a noticeable scar. Alternatively, the nodule may be flattened to the surface of the skin by shaving the top off with a surgical knife, but this removes only the top layers of the dermatofibroma, leaving the deeper layers so that the nodule may grow back again after several years.\nVery rarely, a certain skin cancer that initially resembles a dermatofibroma can spread. This skin cancer has a long name called a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis of any new skin growth, especially one that is dark brown or black or changes color, size or shape. See a doctor immediately if the growth bleeds, grows quickly or becomes painful.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Dermatofibromas are noncancerous growths and they do not become cancerous.\n",

      "What is a detached retina?": "The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that converts light images into nerve impulses that are relayed to the brain to produce sight. When the retina separates from the deeper layers of the eyeball that normally support and nourish it, the retina is said to be detached. Without this nourishment and support, the retina does not function properly, and this can cause a variety of visual symptoms.\nFor example, if the retina detaches near the macula, the part of the eye that is responsible for the center of the visual field (reading, for instance), then there may be a sudden, significant blurring or loss of vision. However, if the area of detachment is closer to the outer edges of the retina, then the visual loss may be more like a curtain being drawn over one side of the visual field (the curtain effect). Other symptoms of retinal detachment may include floating shapes in the field of vision or brief flashes of light.\nAlthough there are several types of retinal detachment, the most common one starts when a tear or hole develops in the retina, and some of the gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye (vitreous fluid) leaks through the opening. Eventually, the leaking vitreous fluid gets behind the retina, separating the retina from other layers of the eye.\n",
      "Symptoms of a detached retina": "Symptoms of a detached retina may include:\n",
      "Diagnosing a detached retina": "After reviewing your symptoms, your doctor will ask about your medical history, especially any history of cataract surgery, nearsightedness, and diabetes or eye trauma. Next, your doctor will examine your eye, and will test how well you can see and your peripheral vision (side vision). Finally, the doctor will use special eye drops to dilate (open) your pupils so he or she can examine the inside of your eye, including the retina. During this retinal examination, the doctor will check for retinal tears and areas of detachment by using a special hand-held ophthalmoscope (a lighted instrument for looking inside the eye) or a slit lamp. If necessary, your doctor will do more tests to determine the extent of your visual field loss.\nIn cases in which the doctor cannot see a retinal detachment while examining your eye, an ultrasound of the eye may be necessary. This can occur when the pupil cannot be fully dilated, or there is some cloudiness inside the eye that prevents the doctor from seeing the retina.\n",
      "Expected duration of a detached retina": "Once a retinal detachment develops and causes symptoms, it should be treated quickly to preserve as much vision as possible. Ideally, the repair should be done less than one week after the detachment began. For detachments threatening the macula (central vision), it is best to treat the problem within the first 24 hours.\n",
      "Preventing a detached retina": "Most retinal detachments are age-related, and there is no way to prevent them. If you are middle-aged or older, you may be able to identify eye problems in their early stages by scheduling an eye examination with an ophthalmologist every one to two years.\nTo prevent retinal detachments that are caused by diabetic retinopathy, people with diabetes should try to maintain near-normal blood sugar levels and to avoid wide swings between high and low blood sugar levels. Also, all diabetics should have a thorough eye examination through dilated pupils at least once a year. If any retinopathy is detected, the examinations should be done every six months.\n",
      "Treating a detached retina": "If you have a detached retina, you should be treated by an ophthalmologist, a physician who specializes in eye problems. Several techniques are available to repair retinal tears and to eliminate the area of separation behind the detached retina. Some options include (in some cases more than one of the options listed below may be combined):\nOnce treatment is complete, you will need to return to your ophthalmologist for regular follow-up visits. These visits are necessary to check for signs that the retina has detached again in your treated eye, or if the problem is happening in your untreated eye. People who already have had a retinal detachment in one eye have an increased risk of detachment in the other eye.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you have symptoms of a detached retina, especially if you have a history of cataract surgery, severe nearsightedness, eye trauma, diabetes, or previous treatment for a detached retina.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With proper treatment, the prognosis is excellent. More than 90% of detached retinas can be reattached successfully. In some cases, more than one treatment is necessary.\nVision is most likely to return to near normal if the problem is treated less than seven days after the detachment begins. Some blurring of vision may remain in people who have detachments that involve the macula (central vision). This is why treatment is an emergency if the macula is still attached.\n",

      "What is developmental dysplasia of the hip?": "In a normal hip joint, the rounded top of the thigh bone (femur) fits into a cup-shaped socket in the pelvis called the acetabulum. This type of joint is called a ball-and-socket joint.\nIn developmental dysplasia of the hip, the top of the femur moves in and out of the socket either part way or all the way. When it moves all the way out of the socket, it is called a dislocation. This happens when the ligaments that hold the two bones together are very loose or because the cup-shaped socket is not deep enough.\nThis condition usually is present at birth. But it can develop during infancy or childhood.\nIf the bones in the joint are not in the right place, the hip and femur can't grow normally. This can lead to:\n",
      "Symptoms of developmental dysplasia of the hip": "In an infant, developmental dysplasia of the hip can result in the following:\n",
      "Diagnosing developmental dysplasia of the hip": "Doctors routinely check for symptoms of developmental dysplasia of the hip during the first physical exam of a newborn. This happens within a day or two of birth. They also check at follow-up well-baby visits.\nAs part of the normal screening for this condition, your doctor will ask about risk factors. He or she will want to know whether your child was delivered in the breech position, is a firstborn, or if there is a family history of the condition in a parent or sibling.\nThe doctor checks your baby for developmental hip dysplasia by gently moving his or her legs while supporting and checking for movement in his or her hips. If the doctor feels enough movement of the hip, he or she may suspect either a hip dislocation or that the hip can be easily dislocated.\nIn this case, the doctor will confirm the diagnosis by ordering either an ultrasound or x-rays of your child's hip. Ultrasound is used in newborns and very young infants. That is because certain parts of the hip bones cannot be seen as clearly with regular x-rays until a child is 3 to 7 months old.\nIn difficult cases, especially in older children with developmental dysplasia of the hip, the doctor may need to order additional imaging tests. These may include a computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or arthrogram. These tests can show greater detail of how the hip joint is put together.\n",
      "Expected duration of developmental dysplasia of the hip": "Treatment lasts until the hip joint becomes stable and the child's ultrasound or x-ray studies are normal. This usually takes one to two months if the baby's dislocation was identified immediately after birth.\n",
      "Preventing developmental dysplasia of the hip": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip can't be prevented. But the problems caused by it can. With early treatment, most cases can go away completely.\nScreening guidelines call for all children to be examined carefully at birth and through 18 months of age. If dysplasia is suspected, ultrasound or other tests should be done to look at the hip. And a referral to an orthopedist should be considered.\nRoutine testing (by ultrasound or x-ray) is controversial, as many cases of dysplasia resolve on their own. In girls with a family history of hip dysplasia or breech presentation, an ultrasound at 2 to 3 weeks should be considered even if the physical exam is normal.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip depends on the child's age:\nNewborns.Newborn babies usually wear a special orthopedic device, such as the Pavlik harness. These devices keep the top of the femur in the socket the right way. After a couple of months of treatment, the hip ligaments gradually tighten and the hip joint usually stabilizes.\nInfants age 1 month to 6 months.As in newborns, the doctor will usually begin treatment with a harness. If this device doesn't help, the doctor will consider gently putting the head of the femur in place while the child is under anesthesia. This procedure is done without surgery. It is called a closed reduction. The child then wears a body cast (spica cast) until x-rays show that the hip joint is normal.\nChildren age 6 months to 1 years.Most children can be treated with closed reduction and a spica cast. Some require open surgery to correct the hip problem.\nChildren older than 2 years.Often, by this time, the hip joint is very deformed and surgery is needed followed by a spica cast.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if:\nDoctors routinely check for developmental hip dysplasia during well baby visits. Tell the doctor if your baby was delivered breech or there is a family history of hip problems.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If the hip problem is identified and treated early, the child should walk normally and have normal hip function.\n",

      "What is it?": "The nasal septum is the wall between the left and right sides of the nose. It is firm, but bendable, and it is covered by skin that has a rich supply of blood vessels. Ideally, the nasal septum should lie exactly in the center, so that the left and right sides of the nose are of equal size. In about 80% of us, however, the nasal septum is a little off-center, although most of us never notice. Less often, the septum is more dramatically off-center. This is called a deviated septum.\nIn people who have a deviated septum, one side of the nose is wider than normal and one is narrower. This alters the pattern of airflow in the nose and sometimes blocks the narrowed side. In some cases, sinus openings can be blocked, triggering a sinus infection (sinusitis) that lasts a long time or keeps returning. The altered airflow pattern within the nose can cause the skin of the nasal septum to become dry and cracked, which can cause frequent nosebleeds.\nSome people are born with a deviated septum because the nose developed that way before birth. A deviated septum can also be caused by injury to the nose during birth. Later in life, a deviated septum can be caused by trauma, although adults and teenagers often cannot remember the injury that caused the problem. In most cases, however, it was probably a blow to one side of the nose — often during contact sports, playground games, or a traffic accident — that knocked the nasal septum out of position.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a deviated septum can include:\nIn some cases, people with a mildly deviated septum have symptoms only when they also have a cold or other upper respiratory tract infection. In these people, the respiratory infection causes nose tissues to swell, which can make airflow problems worse. Once the cold goes away, the symptoms of a deviated septum often go away, too.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "After reviewing your symptoms, the doctor will ask you whether you have ever broken or severely injured your nose and whether you have ever had nasal surgery. Your doctor will look at your nose and the position of your nasal septum. Your doctor will use a bright light and a nasal speculum (an instrument that gently spreads open your nostril) to inspect the inside surface of each nostril. The lining tissues of the nose may be temporarily shrunken by use of Afrin or Neo-Synephrine nasal spray to get a better look at the entire septum. Sometimes a fiberoptic scope will be inserted in the nose to look at the posterior septum directly. In most cases, you will not need any special tests.\nIf your deviated septum is causing troublesome nosebleeds, repeated sinus infections or other significant problems, then your primary care doctor will refer you to an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist) or plastic surgeon for treatment.\n",
      "Expected duration": "A person with a mildly deviated septum may have symptoms only during an upper respiratory tract infection. Someone with a more severe deviation may develop chronic sinusitis or recurring nosebleeds that will last until the problem is corrected surgically.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent a deviated septum by avoiding injury to your nose. To do this, wear seat belts and shoulder harnesses whenever you ride in a car and wear well-fitting headgear to protect your face during contact sports, such as football or karate.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have a deviated septum, talk with your doctor about the need for a type of surgery called septoplasty. In this procedure, the surgeon will move your septum to a normal position. In some cases, the surgeon also will reshape the external appearance of your nose in a procedure called rhinoplasty. When the two procedures are done at the same time, the surgery is called a septorhinoplasty.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If your child has a deviated septum, the doctor may wait until your child's nose has finished growing before doing surgery. In most cases, this is not until age 15 or 16. Boys usually need to wait a little longer than girls because they finish growing a little later.\nIf your child has a deviated septum, the doctor may wait until your child's nose has finished growing before doing surgery. In most cases, this is not until age 15 or 16. Boys usually need to wait a little longer than girls because they finish growing a little later.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In the most cases, surgery is successful. However, a small percentage of patients choose to have a second surgery for cosmetic reasons or to improve airflow.\n",

      "What is it?": "Diabetes mellitus is a condition defined by persistently high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. There are several types of diabetes. The two most common are called type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.\nDuring digestion, food is broken down into its basic components. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body's cells. To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the bloodstream and get inside the cells.\nAn organ in the abdomen called the pancreas produces a hormone called insulin, which is essential to helping glucose get into the body's cells. In a person without diabetes, the pancreas produces more insulin whenever blood levels of glucose rise (for example, after a meal), and the insulin signals the body's cells to take in the glucose. In diabetes, either the pancreas's ability to produce insulin or the cells' response to insulin is altered.\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means it begins when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks other cells in the body. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells (called beta cells) in the pancreas. This leaves the person with little or no insulin in his or her body. Without insulin, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream rather than entering the cells. As a result, the body cannot use this glucose for energy. In addition, the high levels of blood glucose cause excessive urination and dehydration, and damage the body's tissues.\nType 2 diabetes occurs when your body's cells become less responsive to insulin's efforts to drive glucose into the cells, a condition called insulin resistance. As a result, glucose starts to build up in the blood.\nIn people with insulin resistance, the pancreas \"sees\" the blood glucose level rising. The pancreas responds by making extra insulin to try to usher the glucose into the cells. At first, this works, but over time, the body's insulin resistance gets worse. In response, the pancreas makes more and more insulin. Finally, the pancreas gets \"exhausted.\" It cannot keep up with the demand for more and more insulin. As a result, blood glucose levels rise and stay high.\nType 2 diabetes is also called adult-onset diabetes. That's because it almost always used to start in middle or late adulthood. However, more and more children and teens are now developing this condition.\nType 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes. It tends to run in families. Obesity also increases your risk of type 2 diabetes. It is truly a different disease than type 1 diabetes, although both types involve a high blood glucose level and the risk of complications associated with it.\nAnother kind of diabetes, called gestational diabetes, happens in women who have higher-than-expected blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Once it occurs, it lasts throughout the remainder of the pregnancy. Like the other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes happens when the hormone insulin can't efficiently move sugar (glucose) into the body's cells so it can be used as fuel. In gestational diabetes, the body does not respond well to insulin, unless insulin can be produced or provided in larger amounts.\nIn most women, the disorder goes away when the pregnancy ends, but women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Diabetes initially might not cause any symptoms. It can sometimes be caught early with a routine blood test before a person develops symptoms.\nWhen diabetes does cause symptoms, they may include:\nPeople with diabetes also have an increased susceptibility to infections, especially yeast (Candida) infections.\nWhen the amount of insulin in the blood stream is too low, extremely high blood sugar levels can lead to dangerous complications. The body can become too acidic, a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Or the blood sugar level gets so high, the person becomes severely dehydrated. It's called hyperosmolar syndrome.\nThe symptoms of these complications include confused thinking, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and even seizures and coma. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar syndrome is the first sign that a person has diabetes.\nThe treatment of diabetes also can produce symptoms. Too much glucose-lowering medicine, relative to dietary intake, can lead to a blood sugar level that has dropped too low (called hypoglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia include:\nYou can correct hypoglycemia by eating or drinking something that has carbohydrates. This raises your blood sugar level.\nLong-term diabetes can have other complications, including:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Diabetes is diagnosed through blood tests that detect the level of glucose in the blood.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong illness. Usually, type 2 diabetes is also lifelong. However, people with type 2 diabetes can sometimes restore their blood sugar levels to normal just by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and losing weight.\nGestational diabetes usually goes away after childbirth. However, women with gestational diabetes are at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life.\nIn people with diabetes, aging and episodic illnesses can cause the body's insulin resistance to increase. As a result, additional treatment typically is required over time.\n",
      "Prevention": "Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented.\nYou can decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\nIf a close relative — particularly, a parent or sibling — has type 2 diabetes, or if your blood glucose test shows prediabetes (defined as blood glucose levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL), you are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. You can help to prevent type 2 diabetes by\nIf you already have type 2 diabetes, you can still delay or prevent complications by doing the following.\nKeep control of your blood sugar.This helps reduce the risk of most complications.\nLower your risk of heart-related complications.Aggressively manage other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as:\nVisit an eye doctor and a foot specialist every year.This can help you reduce the risk of eye and foot complications.\n",
      "Treatment": "Type 1 diabetes is always treated with insulin injections.\nIn most cases, type 2 diabetes treatment begins with weight reduction through diet and exercise. A healthy diet for a person with diabetes is low in total calories, free of trans fats and nutritionally balanced, with abundant amounts of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and monounsaturated fats.\nMost people with type 2 diabetes need drug therapy to control blood sugar. However, it is possible to achieve normal blood sugar levels with weight loss, a healthy diet and regular exercise.\nEven if medications are required, diet and exercise remain important for controlling diabetes.\nThe medications used for type 2 diabetes include pills and injections. They work in many different ways. They include medications that:\nWeight loss surgery may be an option for some obese people with type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have diabetes, see your doctor regularly.\nPeople with high blood sugar levels have a higher risk of dehydration. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop vomiting or diarrhea and are not able to drink enough fluids.\nMonitor your blood sugar as advised by your health care team. Report any significant deviations in blood sugar levels.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis in people with diabetes varies. It depends on how well an individual modifies his or her risk of complications. If blood sugar is not well controlled, it can increase a person's risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease, which can result in premature death. Disability due to blindness, amputation, heart disease, stroke, and nerve damage may occur. Some people with diabetes become dependent on dialysis treatments because of kidney failure.\n",

      "What is it?": "Diabetic ketoacidosis is a potentially fatal complication of diabetes that occurs when you have much less insulin than your body needs. This problem causes the blood to become acidic and the body to become dangerously dehydrated. Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur when diabetes is not treated adequately, or it can occur during times of serious sickness.\nTo understand this illness, you need to understand the way your body powers itself with sugar and other fuels. Foods we eat are broken down by the body, and much of what we eat becomes glucose (a type of sugar), which enters the bloodstream. Insulin helps glucose to pass from the bloodstream into body cells, where it is used for energy. Insulin normally is made by the pancreas, but people with type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes) don't produce enough insulin and must inject it daily.\nYour body needs a constant source of energy. When you have plenty of insulin, your body cells can get all the energy they need from glucose. If you don't have enough insulin in your blood, your liver is programmed to manufacture emergency fuels. These fuels, made from fat, are called ketones (or keto acids). In a pinch, ketones can give you energy. However, if your body stays dependent on ketones for energy for too long, you soon will become ill. Ketones are acidic chemicals that are toxic at high concentrations.\nIn diabetic ketoacidosis, ketones build up in the blood, seriously altering the normal chemistry of the blood and interfering with the function of multiple organs. They make the blood acidic, which causes vomiting and abdominal pain. If the acid level of the blood becomes extreme, ketoacidosis can cause falling blood pressure, coma and death.\nKetoacidosis is always accompanied by dehydration, which is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. Glucose builds up in the blood if there is not enough insulin to move glucose into your cells. During an episode of ketoacidosis, it is common for blood sugar to rise to a level over 400 milligrams per deciliter. When blood sugar levels are so high, some sugar \"overflows\" into the urine. As sugar is carried away in the urine, water, salt and potassium are drawn into the urine with each sugar molecule, and your body loses large quantities of your fluid and electrolytes, which are minerals that play a crucial role in cell function. As this happens, you produce much more urine than normal. Eventually it may become impossible for you to drink enough fluids to keep up with amounts that you urinate. Vomiting caused by the blood's acidity also contributes to fluid losses and dehydration.\nPeople with type 1 diabetes are at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. If you have type 1 diabetes, ketoacidosis can occur because you have stopped taking your insulin injections or because your insulin dose is too low. It can be triggered by an infection or severe physical stress, such as an injury or surgery, because your body can need more insulin than usual during these stresses.\nKetoacidosis is less likely to occur in people with type 2 diabetes. In most people who have type 2 diabetes, blood insulin levels usually do not get low enough to signal the liver to make ketones.\nIn about 25% of children with diabetes, symptoms from ketoacidosis are the first sign that they have diabetes.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:\nAs blood ketone levels increase, the person's breathing pattern may become slow and deep, and his or her breath can have a fruity odor. A person with ketoacidosis may seem to be tired or confused or may have trouble paying attention. Without prompt treatment in the first day of symptoms, the illness may cause low blood pressure, a loss of consciousness, coma or death.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, it is important to frequently measure your blood glucose levels. If your levels are running high or you are prone to ketoacidosis, you will want to test your urine for ketones. If the urine test strip reads \"moderate\" or \"large,\" it's possible you have ketoacidosis.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "People with diabetic ketoacidosis are always treated in a hospital. Your doctor will test your blood for levels of glucose, ketones, and electrolytes such as sodium and potassium. If you have been taking your insulin without missed doses, your doctor will want to determine if you have an infection.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis can develop over a period of a few hours, and treatment results in rapid recovery. Commonly, people who develop ketoacidosis will remain in the hospital for one to three days.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you have type 1 diabetes, you usually can prevent diabetic ketoacidosis by following the insulin regimen and diet prescribed by your doctor and by testing your blood glucose regularly. If your body is stressed by an infection, ketoacidosis can develop within hours, and you may not be able to prevent it. It is important for you to check your blood sugar more frequently during an infection, so you can adjust your treatment. It is also important for you to recognize that vomiting and abdominal pain may be signs of ketoacidosis, so that you can get medical help quickly.\nTo help make sure that you receive proper emergency treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis if you are away from home, wear a medical identification necklace or bracelet that identifies you as a diabetic. This will help emergency personnel to recognize your problem quickly if you are among strangers and you are too sick to speak for yourself.\n",
      "Treatment": "Diabetic ketoacidosis requires treatment in a hospital, often in the intensive care unit. You will receive a large volume of fluids intravenously (through a vein) and insulin to lower your blood sugar and to correct the acidosis. Your blood sugar and acid levels will be monitored frequently, and you will be given potassium supplements to restore your body's supply of this essential mineral. Until your blood chemistry returns to normal, your vital signs (temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure) and urine output will be monitored closely. If an infection has triggered your episode of ketoacidosis, antibiotics or other medications will be used to treat the infection.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have type 1 diabetes and feel unwell, check your blood sugar levels often. Also test your urine for ketones. Call your doctor if you have:\n",
      "Prognosis": "With prompt treatment, more than 95 percent of patients recover from diabetic ketoacidosis.\n",

      "What is it?": "Diabetic nephropathy is kidney disease that is a complication of diabetes. It can occur in people with type 2 diabetes, the diabetes type that is most common and is caused by resistance to insulin, or in people with type 1 diabetes, the type that more often begins at an early age and results from decreased insulin production. Diabetic nephropathy is caused by damage to the tiniest blood vessels. When small blood vessels begin to develop damage, both kidneys begin to leak proteins into the urine. As damage to the blood vessels continues, the kidneys gradually lose their ability to remove waste products from the blood.\n\nUp to 40% of people with type 1 diabetes eventually develop significant kidney disease, which sometimes requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. Only 4% to 6% of all type 2 diabetes patients end up requiring dialysis, although about 20% to 30% of people with type 2 diabetes will develop at least some kidney damage. About 40% of all people who need to start dialysis have kidney failure from type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "Symptoms": "There are usually no symptoms in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy. When symptoms do begin to appear, they may include ankle swelling and mild fatigue. Later symptoms include extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and urinating less than usual.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The first sign of kidney damage is protein in the urine, which a doctor can measure in microscopic amounts, called microalbuminuria. Small amounts of albumin show up in the urine five to 10 years before major kidney damage happens.\nIf you have diabetes, your doctor will suggest regular monitoring of urine, and blood tests to check the health of your kidneys.\nOccasionally, a doctor may be concerned that kidney injury in a diabetic person is related to a separate problem. In that case, other tests such as ultrasound or a kidney biopsy may be recommended. In a biopsy, a small piece of kidney tissue is removed through a needle and examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Kidney disease can't be reversed once damage is done. Kidney disease from diabetes is progressive, meaning it continues to get worse. However, good control of blood sugar and blood pressure and treatment with medicine from either of two drug groups (see prevention, below) can slow the progression of the disease.\n",
      "Prevention": "The best way to prevent diabetic nephropathy is to control your blood sugar and to keep your blood pressure in the normal range. The systolic pressure, the \"top\" blood pressure number, should be consistently lower than 130 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).\nTwo types of blood pressure medicines protect against kidney damage in ways that go beyond lowering your blood pressure. Any person who has diabetes and who also has high blood pressure should regularly take one of these medications. These medicines come from a group of drugs called angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), including lisinopril (Zestril, Prinivil), enalapril (Vasotec), moexipril (Univasc), benazepril (Lotensin), and others, or from a group of drugs called angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), including losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan), and others.\nAvoiding medications that can sometimes have harmful side effects upon the kidneys also can help to prevent kidney disease. If you have severe kidney disease, your doctor may advise you to avoid pain medications in the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug group (NSAID group) such as ibuprofen.\nA low-protein diet (10% to 12% or less of total calories) also may slow or halt the progression of kidney disease. If you smoke cigarettes, you should quit.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have diabetes with microalbuminuria or blood test evidence of kidney disease, you can slow the progression of kidney disease by taking a drug called an SGLT2 inhibitor. Examples of SGLT2 inhibitors approved to help preserve kidney function even in people without diabetes include canagliflozin (Invokana) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga). If you have diabetes and high blood pressure, doctors usually prescribe a medication from the ACE inhibitor or ARB group as part of the hypertension treatment program. These medications slow the progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes, although kidney disease continues to develop gradually. These two medicine groups are closely related, so the drugs usually are not combined with each other.\nReducing the amount of protein in your diet also may be helpful to slow progressing kidney disease.\nOnce nephropathy reaches advanced stages, you may need dialysis to remove waste products from the blood. There are two types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\nHemodialysis filters waste substances and excess fluid out of the blood. Hemodialysis usually is done at a dialysis center in three- to four-hour sessions three times a week. Peritoneal dialysis does not directly filter the blood. Instead, for this form of dialysis, sterile fluid is allowed to flow into the abdominal cavity through a catheter that is permanently placed through the skin. The fluid is then removed after it has absorbed waste substances.\nAfter practice, peritoneal dialysis can be done at home. It is a good alternative for some people, although it requires significant time and self-care.\nAn alternative way to treat advanced kidney disease is with a kidney transplant. Kidney transplants have allowed many people with severe kidney disease to avoid or discontinue dialysis. However, the donor and the recipient have to match genetically, or the body will reject the new kidney. The waiting period for a matching donated kidney is between two and six years.\nAnti-rejection drugs that suppress the immune system help the body to accept the donated organ. An organ recipient can expect to take such medications as long as the transplanted kidney continues to function. A transplanted kidney is likely to function for at least 10 years if its genetics are closely matched. If a transplanted kidney stops functioning, dialysis or a new transplant is necessary.\nIn a person with type 1 diabetes and kidney failure, a kidney-pancreas transplant is another possible treatment. This option is available only for a small number of people because of the scarcity of organ donors, the risks of the surgery, and the need for lifelong immunosuppressive drugs. When it is successful, the transplanted pancreas begins producing insulin and may reverse diabetes.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have diabetes, your blood pressure should be checked every six months to a year, or more often if it is higher than goal. If you have not been diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy, your urine should be tested for microalbumin at least once a year to check for this problem and diagnose it as early as possible. People with kidney disease need to have regular tests of kidney function — once a year or more often. If you have symptoms that suggest advanced kidney disease, you should discuss them with your physician.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although kidney failure cannot always be prevented, worsening can be slowed with medications and control of risk factors. When full kidney failure occurs, dialysis and a kidney transplant are options that allow people to continue to lead active lives.\n",

      "What is it?": "Diabetic neuropathies are nerve disorders that may affect people with diabetes. They occur more often in people with persistently high blood sugar levels.\nThere are several different diabetic neuropathies. They include:\nDiabetic neuropathies occur in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. They are most common in people whose blood glucose (blood sugar) levels are not well controlled.\nDiabetic neuropathies can occur in people who have had diabetes for a short time. But they are most likely to affect those who have had the disease for more than a decade. It is also more common in people older than 40. People with diabetes who smoke are especially at risk.\nDiabetic neuropathy results from several changes in the nerves. A persistently high concentration of blood sugar surrounding nerve cells definitely plays a role. The nerve cells must adjust their internal sugar content to be in balance with their surroundings. To do so, nerve cells make and store the sugar sorbitol. Sorbitol can gradually damage nerve cells.\nDamage to blood vessels also contributes to diabetic neuropathy. When blood vessels that feed nerve cells are damaged, the nerves may not get enough oxygen and nourishment.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most people who have had diabetes for 25 years have some form of neuropathy. Symptoms depend on the specific type of neuropathy.\nIf your feet are numb, you may not be aware when shoes don't fit properly. This can lead to the formation of a callus. These thickened skin areas can break down over time. They can change into an open sore (ulcer) that may become infected.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor usually can diagnose diabetic neuropathy based on your:\nWhen necessary, more specialized testing may be done, such as:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Peripheral and autonomic neuropathies are usually long-term problems. Focal neuropathy may last a few months, but may be chronic.\n",
      "Prevention": "Diabetic neuropathy is caused by abnormally high levels of blood glucose. Therefore, diabetics can help to prevent neuropathy by keeping blood sugar levels under good control.\nIn addition, avoiding smoking can help to prevent or delay neuropathies.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment of diabetic neuropathy focuses on\nHealthy eating and regular exercise can keep blood sugar under control in some people with diabetes. For others, treatment with one or more medication or with insulin may be needed.\nTo relieve the pain of peripheral neuropathy, your doctor may first prescribe acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen or naproxen.\nThere are many other medications available to reduce nerve pain. These include\nYour doctor may also recommend that you rub on a pain-relieving cream containing capsaicin or apply a lidocaine patch to the painful area. Other options include isosorbide dinitrate topical spray or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in which a patch of skin receives tiny electrical shocks intended to interrupt pain signals from the affected area.\nIf you have gastroparesis, eating small, frequent meals low in fat and fiber may help. Your doctor may prescribe metoclopramide (Reglan) to help the stomach empty.\nThere are many available treatments for constipation and diarrhea.\nTo help relieve constipation, drink plenty of fluids and exercise regularly. You also can take\nUse laxatives sparingly. Overuse may lead to dependence and make constipation worse.\nFor diarrhea, your doctor may prescribe\nIf you have poor emptying of the urinary bladder, your doctor will help you minimize medicines that could contribute to the problem of incomplete bladder emptying. Catheters can be used to empty the bladder when neuropathy is severe. Bladder infections requiring antibiotics commonly occur in people with abnormal bladder function.\nFor erectile dysfunction (impotence), your doctor may prescribe\nOther possible treatments for erectile dysfunction include\nDizziness when standing can be treated by drinking more fluids. Medicines that increase your body salt and water can also help.\nFor carpal tunnel syndrome, splints, an injection of a corticosteroid, or surgery may be recommended.\nIf peripheral neuropathy affects your feet, you should:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you develop new or worsening symptoms of neuropathy.\nCall your doctor whenever you have a cut or sore that isn't healing or looks like it is infected. It is extremely important to react promptly to injuries and infections, however minor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases of focal neuropathy, muscle weakness and/or pain subsides within a few months.\nPeripheral neuropathies are persistent problems. The pain can last for years. Some people find that symptoms are easier to tolerate if the painful areas lose sensation and become numb. However, complete loss of feeling increases the risk of foot ulcers.\n",

      "What is diarrhea?": "Diarrhea is more frequent and more liquid bowel movements than normal. There are many causes. Diarrhea often is caused by an infection with bacteria, viruses or a parasite. Bacteria cause diarrhea either by invading the intestine or by producing a toxin that makes the intestine secrete more water. When the diarrhea is caused by food contaminated with infectious agents or a toxin produced by bacteria, people often refer to this as food poisoning.\n\nOther causes of diarrhea include:\n",
      "Symptoms of diarrhea": "People with diarrhea usually have loose, watery stools. Less commonly, people pass frequent, small amounts of loose stool with mucous and blood. Other symptoms can include:\nFrequent vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration (abnormally low levels of body water) if too much fluid is lost from the body. Signs of dehydration include:\n",
      "Diagnosing diarrhea": "Since diarrhea has many possible causes, your doctor will ask you about your personal circumstances. Recent travel history or exposure to family members with similar symptoms might suggest an infection.\nYour doctor will review your symptoms and examine you. If you have severe symptoms, your doctor also may ask for a stool sample. The specimen will be analyzed in a laboratory to look for infectious causes.\n",
      "Expected duration of diarrhea": "Symptoms of diarrhea are usually most severe during the first 24 hours. Although some episodes of acute diarrhea last as long as 14 days, most go away within three to seven days.\n",
      "Preventing diarrhea": "You can help to prevent diarrhea by practicing good hygiene. Most importantly, wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before eating, before preparing food, and after using the bathroom. Since some diarrhea is caused by food poisoning, avoid eating undercooked meats, raw seafood, or foods left out for several hours. If your episodes of diarrhea occur only rarely, a specific cause may not be found. If you experience recurrent episodes, try to identify the factors that trigger your symptoms, such as a reaction to medicine or certain foods, and avoid them.\n",
      "Treating diarrhea": "When symptoms start, try to rest more and switch to a diet of clear liquids. Drink water, juice, bouillon and weak tea to avoid becoming dehydrated. Replace lost fluids and electrolytes with sports drinks. Avoid coffee or soft drinks that contain caffeine, since caffeine increases the loss of water and salt. If you have nausea in addition to diarrhea, take very small sips of fluid frequently and suck on ice chips.\nAs you begin to feel better, start eating solid foods gradually to prevent stomach cramps. Start with soft, starchy foods (cooked cereal, steamed rice, unbuttered toast, and applesauce) before returning to your normal diet. To ease stomach cramps, apply warmth (a hot water bottle, warm compress or electric heating pad set on low heat) to your abdomen. You also may consider over-the-counter medications such as bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) or loperamide (Imodium).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Although most bouts of acute diarrhea run their course, you should call your doctor if your condition lasts more than 48 hours and you have a fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, consult your doctor if you notice mucus or blood in your stool, experience persistent abdominal pain, or show symptoms of dehydration.\n",

      "What are diverticulosis and diverticulitis?": "In diverticulosis, small pouches develop and bulge out through weak spots in the walls of the colon, typically in the part of the colon called the sigmoid colon on the left side of the abdomen. These small, balloon-like pouches are called diverticula.\nThe condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States ages 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men.\n\nIf the diverticula become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis.\nDiverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as abscess, perforation, intestinal blockage from internal scarring, or fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs. A rare but life-threatening complication called peritonitis can occur when diverticula rupture, leaking infection into the abdominal cavity.\n",
      "Symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis": "Most people who have diverticulosis don't have any symptoms, but some have mild cramps, constipation, or bloating. Diverticulitis causes more severe symptoms, including any of the following, but particularly the first two:\nLower intestinal bleeding can occur in people with diverticulosis. The loss of blood can cause weakness and dizziness.\n",
      "Diagnosing diverticulosis and diverticulitis": "The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States aged 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. However, unless you have had a colonoscopy, CT scan of your abdomen, or barium enema, you would not be aware they exist.\nOn the other hand, diverticulitis almost always causes symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, bowel habits, and diet and will conduct a physical examination. Your doctor will press on your abdomen to check for tenderness.\nBased on the location of your symptoms and the location of abdominal pain and tenderness, your doctor may be able to make the diagnosis without further testing. If your doctor is unsure or concerned that you may have an abscess or other complication, he or she will likely order additional studies. These usually include blood tests for signs of infection and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan.\nLower intestinal bleeding is commonly caused by a broken blood vessel within a diverticula. But it is often very difficult to identify the exact bleeding site, even with colonoscopy.\n",
      "Expected duration of diverticulosis and diverticulitis": "Diverticula do not disappear unless the section of colon is removed surgically. Diverticulosis is a lifelong condition that can be managed, primarily with adjustments in diet.\nSymptoms of diverticulitis or bleeding from diverticulosis may subside within a few days after treatment, may continue, or may get worse in the case of severe illness or complications.\n",
      "Preventing diverticulosis and diverticulitis": "People whose diets contain large amounts of fiber are less likely to develop diverticular disease. The recommended daily fiber intake is at least 20 grams per day, but a healthier goal is 35 grams of fiber daily, preferably from fruits, vegetables, and grains. Your doctor also may recommend unprocessed bran or a fiber product. It is important to increase fiber intake gradually and to drink more water to increase the bulk of the bowel movements, which reduces pressure inside the bowel.\nPhysical activity also may lower the risk of diverticulosis. Many doctors previously recommended that people with diverticulosis avoid eating nuts, popcorn, and foods with seeds. This restriction has not been proven to prevent diverticulitis.\n",
      "Treating diverticulosis and diverticulitis": "The only possible treatment for diverticulosis is to increase fiber in the diet. Fiber will not heal existing diverticula, but it may prevent more from forming.\nIf you have symptoms of mild diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend a short period of observation without antibiotics. There are no specific dietary recommendations, but many doctors suggest a low-fiber diet until symptoms resolve. If the diagnosis is uncertain, an abdominal CT scan is usually ordered. Depending on the results, your doctor can then decide if treatment at home with oral antibiotics versus intravenous (IV) antibiotics, either at home or in the hospital.\nIf fever and pain continues, you may be developing complicated diverticulitis, For example, an abscess can develop when a diverticulum becomes perforated (develops a hole). An abscess is a collection of pus. A surgeon then will help your doctor plan the next step: drainage or surgery. The choice depends on the extent of the problem and your overall health. Drainage means that the surgeon cleans out the pus.\nSurgery also may be required during the hospital stay to treat a particularly severe episode of diverticulitis. Emergency surgery is required if the abscess breaks open and causes peritonitis, the most serious potential complication of diverticulitis. Peritonitis requires surgical repair as well as intravenous antibiotics.\nFor persistent or recurrent bleeding from diverticulosis, surgery may be the only option.\nThe most common procedure, known as a colon resection, involves removing the part of the colon that contains the bleeding diverticula and reattaching the ends.\nWhen done during emergencies, a colon resection is often done as a two-stage process. First, a section of colon is removed, but because of infection, it is not safe to rejoin the ends. Instead, the surgeon creates a temporary hole, or stoma, in the abdomen and connects the colon to it, a procedure called a colostomy. A bag is attached to collect the stool. Later, a second operation is done to reattach the end of the colon, and remove the colostomy.\n\nAfter successful treatment for diverticulitis, your doctor normally will recommend a high-fiber diet. Later, you may need to have a procedure called a colonoscopy, which is an internal examination of the colon.\nIn general, surgery is not recommended after only one or even two attacks without complications. However, it is usually recommended after a third episode occurs in the same location within the colon.\nRepeated episodes of diverticulitis can lead to internal scarring and narrowing of the colon, which also may require surgery to remove a piece of the colon.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if abdominal pain in one spot lasts for longer than a few hours, especially if it becomes worse or is accompanied by fever.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With proper treatment and a high-fiber diet, the outlook for people with diverticulosis and uncomplicated diverticulitis is excellent. Most people with diverticulosis never have symptoms.\nPeople who have diverticulitis usually improve within two to four days after treatment begins. Over 85% of patients recover with bed rest and liquid diet, with or without antibiotics.

      "What Is It?": "Down syndrome is a disorder caused by a problem with the chromosomes — the pieces of DNA that have the blueprint for the human body. Normally a person has two copies of each chromosome, but a person with Down syndrome has three copies of chromosome 21. The condition also is called trisomy 21.\nIn a few cases, the extra copy is part of another chromosome (translocation), or found in only some of the person's cells (mosaicism).\nThe extra DNA makes the physical and mental characteristics of Down syndrome, which include a small head that is flattened in the back; slanted eyes; extra skin folds at the corners of the eyes; small ears, nose and mouth; big-looking tongue; short stature; small hands and feet; and some degree of mental disability.\nDown syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 800 births. It's the most common chromosome problem seen in live births.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In addition to the characteristic physical features and decreased mental abilities, other health problems frequently are seen in people with Down syndrome. These include:\nPeople with Down syndrome develop leukemia more often than those without the disorder, and they are more likely to develop infections, problems with the immune system, skin disorders and seizures.\nInfants with Down syndrome usually develop more slowly than other children of the same age, although a wide variation is seen. Language development is typically much slower, as is motor development. Their body strength may seem a little weak. For example, most toddlers walk between 12 and 14 months of age, but toddlers with Down syndrome walk between 15 and 36 months.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Down syndrome frequently is suspected at birth based on physical appearance. The diagnosis usually is confirmed by a blood test to examine the chromosomes. Additional testing may be done, including chest X-rays, echocardiography and an electrocardiogram, to check for heart problems. Sometimes X-ray studies of the gastrointestinal tract are done as well.\nIn some cases, Down syndrome is suspected during pregnancy from the results of a fetal ultrasound and blood test that measures the levels of three chemicals (a \"triple-screen\" test) in a pregnant woman's blood. If these results are abnormal, further tests can be done to help diagnose Down syndrome.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Down syndrome continues throughout life.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent Down syndrome. However, the chance of having a child with Down syndrome increases as the age of the mother increases.\nParents who already have a child with Down syndrome are more likely to have another child with the same problem in future pregnancies. Genetic testing can help to determine the amount of risk.\n",
      "Treatment": "There is no treatment to reverse the genetic abnormality that causes Down syndrome. However, many of the associated medical and developmental conditions can be treated to:\nMany health care professionals may be involved in assessing and planning the course of treatment for a child with Down syndrome. Surgery may be required for cardiac or gastrointestinal problems.\nPhysical therapy and integrated special education services help children with Down syndrome to make the most of their abilities and reach their potential. Children with Down syndrome usually respond very well to sensory stimulation, exercises to help their muscle control, and activities to help their mental development. School helps children with Down syndrome to learn social, academic and physical skills that may allow them to attain a very high level of functioning and independence.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Most cases of Down syndrome are detected early in life. Call your doctor if you suspect that your child has Down syndrome that has not been diagnosed or if you have questions about your risk of having a child with Down syndrome.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for a person with Down syndrome varies with the accompanying medical and developmental conditions. The outlook continues to improve, as educators and health care professionals recognize the importance of early interventions to promote both health and development. Advances in medical treatments have greatly improved the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome, with the majority living past age 55.\n",

      "What is dry eye syndrome?": "Dry eye syndrome occurs when there is an inadequate quantity or quality of tear production to moisten, protect and cleanse the eyes. Dry eye syndrome is one of the most common eye problems. And it becomes more common as people age because tear production can diminish as part of the aging process.\nMore women are affected than men. And the syndrome is more likely to flare up at times of hormonal change such as after menopause or during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Birth control pills can trigger dry eye syndrome, and so can many other medications, including antidepressants, antihistamines, decongestants, antianxiety agents and diuretics or other blood pressure pills. Some medicines that are used in the eye also can cause dry eyes as an allergic reaction.\nSeveral autoimmune disorders also can affect the body's ability to produce tears normally, including Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis, as well as other conditions such as Bell's palsy and thyroid dysfunction.\n",
      "Symptoms of dry eye syndrome": "Dry eye syndrome can cause:\nExcessive tearing may seem to be an unusual symptom for dry eye syndrome. But these are called irritant tears, and are produced as a reflex reaction to the syndrome. They contain more water than normal tears, which have a balance of water, fat and mucus. Therefore, the excess tears just run off the eyes and cannot lubricate them as well as healthy tears do.\n",
      "Diagnosing dry eye syndrome": "After speaking with you about your eye symptoms and general health, including past medical problems, your doctor may suspect that you have dry eye syndrome. A complete physical examination, and sometimes, certain blood tests may help to determine whether you also have an autoimmune disorder. Your doctor may refer you to an optometrist or ophthalmologist so your eyes can be evaluated more completely for:\n\n",
      "Expected duration of dry eye syndrome": "Dryness of the eyes may be brief if it is related to a medication, hormonal fluctuation or other reversible condition. However, if it is related to an autoimmune condition, it may be chronic (longer lasting).\n",
      "Preventing dry eye syndrome": "To reduce your chances of developing dry eyes, try the following:\nPay particular attention to these precautions if you have a medical condition or take a medication that is associated with dry eye syndrome. Sometimes, changing your medication may help, though this should be done only with your doctor's supervision. If your symptoms are severe, you can protect your eyes from dry air during outdoor activities by wearing swim or ski goggles or other protective eyewear to retain moisture around the eyes.\n",
      "Treating dry eye syndrome": "The two most common methods of treatment are to replace tears or to conserve them. In most cases, you can use artificial tears, which mimic the composition of natural tears, and are available over the counter. Lubricating ointments can be used for more severe cases, but they tend to blur vision and so should be applied at bedtime.\nIf these do not relieve the symptoms, your doctor may try to conserve tears by plugging the tear drain holes, called puncta, with tiny plugs made of collagen or silicone. In the worst cases, the holes can be closed permanently using electric cauterization.\n\nIf these treatments are not effective, another approach is to increase tear production by using topical drugs, including cyclosporine. Topical cyclosporine (Restasis) decreases inflammation in the tear-producing glands and that may lead to better tear production. Another topical treatment, lifitegrast (Xiidra) was approved by the FDA in 2016.  It is thought to block the action of key immune cells and their chemical messengers involved in eye inflammation that leads to dryness. A nasal spray, varenicline, can increase tear production and reduce symptoms of dry eye disease. It was approved by the FDA for this condition in 2021.\nSpecial contact lenses can help maintain tears over the eye but they are expensive and the fitting process is complicated. As a result, these lenses are not a common treatment.\nLimited research suggests that other potentially effective treatments for dry eye syndrome include:\nHumidifiers, wet compresses and glasses that protect the eyes from dry air (such as wrap-around sunglasses, goggles or glasses fitted with \"shields\" on the sides) also can help.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if your symptoms last more than a few days. Consult a doctor before beginning treatment with over-the-counter artificial tears.\n",
      "Prognosis": "For most cases, the outlook is good because the condition is more of an annoyance than a danger to your health or your eyes. Symptoms often go away quickly if you remove contact lenses or change your medications or your environment. Even when symptoms persist, they usually can be controlled.\n",

      "What is it?": "Normal skin has a soft, supple texture because of its water content. For skin to feel soft, pliable and \"normal,\" its top layer must contain a minimum of 10% water — and ideally between 20% and 35%. To help protect the outer layer of skin from losing water, the skin's sebaceous glands produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is a complex mixture of fatty acids, sugars, waxes and other natural chemicals that form a protective barrier against water evaporation. If the skin doesn't have enough sebum, it loses water and feels dry. If environmental factors cause more water evaporation and overwhelm the ability of sebum to prevent water loss, the skin will shrivel and crack.\nDecreased production of sebum— This is often a factor in the elderly, since the number and activity of sebaceous glands in the skin tends to decrease with age. Dry skin, also called xerosis, is a very common problem in modern societies, affecting people of all ages, even infants. In the United States, most cases of dry skin are related to one or more of the following factors:\nDry skin is a common problem in people with diabetes or skin allergies (atopic dermatitis). Less often, it can also be a symptom of hypothyroidism, kidney failure or Sjögren's syndrome. In addition, dry skin sometimes develops as a side effect of medication, especially acne products that are applied to the skin.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Sometimes, the only symptom of dry skin is itching, although most people also will notice that their skin is flaky and slightly more wrinkled than normal. Symptoms of dry skin may worsen during the winter months, especially if you spend a lot of time indoors, where the heated air is dry.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "In most cases of uncomplicated dry skin, you can make the diagnosis yourself. Begin by examining your normal skin care routine. Do you often take long, hot baths or showers that may be washing away your skin's protective sebum? Do you shower several times a day or scrub your skin surface with harsh soaps? Do you have a job that requires frequent handwashing?\nNext, examine your environmental risk factors, both indoors and outdoors. Do you live in a dry, desert climate? Do you usually spend your winter months indoors, in heated rooms without a humidifier? When you do go outdoors, do you protect your skin with appropriate clothing or with a sunscreen on exposed surfaces? When was the last time you used a moisturizer?\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once you begin to take care of your skin properly, the flakiness and itch of dry skin should improve within one or two weeks. In many cases, a good moisturizer will begin to make your skin look softer and suppler within minutes.\nWithout proper care, dry skin can become a chronic problem that can lead to skin thickening, cracking and bleeding. This may increase your risk of skin infections.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent dry skin by taking these steps:\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have a simple case of dry skin, begin by trying the suggestions outlined in the Prevention section. If your dry skin persists, contact your doctor's office for advice.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your primary care doctor or a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin problems) if you have:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Overall, the prognosis is excellent. You can often prevent dry skin by making a few simple changes in lifestyle. If dry skin develops, there are many soothing and effective treatments available. Most can be purchased without a prescription.\n",

      "What is dysfunctional uterine bleeding?": "Dysfunctional uterine bleeding, also called anovulatory bleeding, is any bleeding from the vagina that varies from a woman's normal menstrual cycle. The normal cycle is triggered by signals from hormones. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding occurs when the cycle's hormonal signals get thrown off. This can include alternating periods that are heavy and light, spotting or unpredictable shorter and longer cycles.\nRegular monthly menstrual cycles flush out the endometrial lining, which is the blood-enriched layer of tissue that grows inside the uterus every month in anticipation of a possible pregnancy. If ovulation does not occur, periods can be delayed, which allows the lining to grow thicker. For this reason, delayed periods are often heavy ones.\nLighter periods, or spotting between periods, may represent an endometrial lining that is unstable and leaking, either because hormonal levels don't adequately support it or because the lining may be too thick.\nOther factors that can change bleeding patterns include:\n",
      "Symptoms of dysfunctional uterine bleeding": "Irregular bleeding can come at different times from month to month and last for different lengths of time. The amount of blood flow may vary from light to extremely heavy with large clots. In some people, the bleeding may be associated with uterine cramps.\n",
      "Diagnosing dysfunctional uterine bleeding": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history and about symptoms that might suggest a cause for the irregular bleeding or other hormonal abnormalities. The doctor may do various tests to check for these causes of abnormal bleeding patterns:\nIf you have heavy bleeding, your doctor will check iron levels in your blood to see if you are anemic.\n",
      "Expected duration of dysfunctional uterine bleeding": "Most women have a period that is irregular in timing or in the amount of bleeding at some point during their menstrual years, most often because of a cycle without a normal ovulation. Normal periods may resume as early as the next period or might take a few months to become regular again. Some women become regular only with the help of treatments, such as birth control pills. If irregular periods signal the beginning of menopause, the last period may not occur for a few months or a few years.\n",
      "Preventing dysfunctional uterine bleeding": "There is no way to prevent dysfunctional uterine bleeding. See a doctor promptly if you continue to have irregular periods. Early diagnosis and treatment can help to make your periods regular again, which is important for your overall health.\n",
      "Treating dysfunctional uterine bleeding": "If the cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is another medical condition, treating that condition should restore normal cycles. Otherwise, treatment is based on the cause, the amount of bleeding and the woman's reproductive goals (whether she wants to have children or not).\nBirth control pills, which combine the hormones estrogen and progesterone, can regulate and decrease the amount of bleeding. Your doctor may recommend that you take monthly pills containing progesterone only. Women seeking to become pregnant may be treated with medications to help their ovaries ovulate more regularly.\nHeavy bleeding can be stopped with higher doses of hormone pills — either estrogen or progesterone. When bleeding is more severe, hospitalization may be necessary. If hormonal therapy does not work, a surgical D and C (dilation and curettage) can stop severe cases of bleeding. During this procedure, the tissue lining of the uterus is removed, allowing a healthier lining to take its place.\nIf an endometrial biopsy reveals endometrial hyperplasia, which is a thicker and abnormal looking lining, closer monitoring with treatment may be required, especially in older women and postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy. Endometrial hyperplasia increases a woman's risk of developing endometrial cancer.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor right away for an evaluation if you are having fevers, abdominal pain or heavy bleeding with dizziness or fainting.\nIf your periods are irregular over a few months, make an appointment to see your doctor. Be prepared to tell your doctor the dates of your last few periods.\n",
      "Prognosis": "There are many effective treatments to help regulate periods and control irregular bleeding. If you have irregular periods and are having difficulty becoming pregnant, you can take drugs that stimulate ovulation. Having irregular periods, however, does not mean you are infertile. You still need to use protection against pregnancy when you are sexually active.\n",

      "What is dyslexia?": "Dyslexia is the most common learning disability. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition, and by poor spelling and decoding abilities.\nThese difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonologic component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension, and reduced reading experience that can impede the growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.\nSomeone with dyslexia has trouble reading and writing, even though he or she has the intelligence and motivation needed to learn to read. Although people with dyslexia have trouble understanding words they read, they usually can understand the same words when they are read aloud by another person.\nResearchers don't know exactly what causes dyslexia, but they think a problem during development may affect the way the brain processes information. They also believe that genetics (inheritance) plays a part. Although a gene for dyslexia has not been found, dyslexia does tend to run in families. Dyslexia is not caused by a physical disability, such as vision or hearing problems. Many people with dyslexia have average or above average intelligence. Basically, the brains of people with dyslexia have a hard time receiving, organizing, remembering, or using information.\nIn the United States, approximately 5% to 10% of the population probably has some sort of dyslexia.\n",
      "Symptoms of dyslexia": "A person with dyslexia may have a hard time with:\nFor example, a person with dyslexia tends to reverse or misread letters or words, such as confusing the letter \"b\" for \"d\" or reading the number \"6\" as \"9.\" He or she may read the word \"was\" as \"saw,\" or may switch the order of words in a sentence, such as \"are there\" instead of \"there are.\"\nBecause of these difficulties, a person with dyslexia usually reads slowly, and tends to hesitate more often than expected.\nDyslexia is not a vision problem. The eyes do not see words incorrectly, but the brain apparently has difficulty processing the visual information.\nIt is important to note that many young children reverse letters and numbers, misread words, or misunderstand words as a normal part of learning to read. Children with dyslexia, however, continue to do so after their peers have stopped, usually by first or second grade. Dyslexia may not be recognized until a child starts school, when a student of normal intelligence begins to fall behind his or her classmates in academic performance.\n",
      "Diagnosing dyslexia": "Your doctor will ask about medical, developmental, and family histories, and will consider possible physical causes that could make reading difficult, such as hearing or vision problems. The doctor will look for signs of other problems that could be causing reading difficulties. These could include motor coordination disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, and thyroid disorders. If no physical causes are found, the doctor may refer you or your child to a learning specialist for evaluation.\nThere is no single test to diagnose dyslexia. A number of standardized tests are used to evaluate intelligence, language, behavior, and academic skills. Psychologists or education specialists at schools or hospitals can do the tests. There is no single test to diagnose dyslexia.\n",
      "Expected duration of dyslexia": "Dyslexia cannot be cured, but people with this disorder can learn ways to be successful in schoolwork and life. With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, many people with dyslexia go on to succeed both academically and professionally. However, dyslexia is a lifelong condition, not a temporary developmental delay.\n",
      "Preventing dyslexia": "There is no known way to prevent dyslexia. However, because the neurologic problems that cause dyslexia may be related to prenatal factors, and children who are born prematurely or at a low birthweight may be at higher risk for dyslexia, it is wise to follow the usual recommendations for a healthy pregnancy.\n",
      "Treating dyslexia": "Several techniques and strategies are used to help people with dyslexia. These include taping lectures rather than writing notes, listening to books on tape rather than reading them, using flash cards, and using computer software to check spelling and grammar.\nTreatment may involve time spent with speech and language therapists, tutors, and special education teachers. With support, most children with dyslexia adjust to their learning disability and remain in a regular classroom. Some may require special education.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if your child seems to be far behind his or her friends and classmates in reading or writing, particularly if there is a family history of dyslexia or another learning disorder. If your child is having trouble in school and you think there are signs of a learning disability, talk with your child's teacher and doctor. That way you can catch any problems early, and give your child the best chance for success.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most children with dyslexia can do well academically and professionally, despite the fact that dyslexia is a lifelong disability. The outlook for each child with dyslexia depends on how severe the disability is, how early it is diagnosed, and the quality of the treatment.\n",

      "What is it?": "Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is a form of depression. It may be less severe than major depression, but — as the name suggests — it lasts longer. Many people with this type of depression describe having been depressed as long as they can remember, or they feel they are going in and out of depression all the time.\nThe symptoms of persistent depressive disorder are similar to those of major depression. In this disorder, the long duration is the key to the diagnosis, not the intensity of symptoms. As with major depression, mood may be low (or irritable in children and adolescents). An individual with persistent depressive disorder may feel less pleasure and a lack of energy. He or she may feel relatively unmotivated and disengaged from life. Appetite and weight can increase or decrease. The person may sleep too much or have trouble sleeping. Indecisiveness, pessimism and poor self-image may also be present.\nSymptoms can grow into a full-blown episode of major depression. People with persistent depressive disorder have a greater-than-average chance of developing major depression.\nWhile major depression often occurs in episodes, persistent depressive disorder is defined as more constant, lasting for years. The disorder sometimes starts in childhood. As a result, a person with persistent depressive disorder tends to believe that depression is part of his or her character, and so self-defining that he or she may not even think to talk about this depression with doctors, family members or friends.\nPersistent depressive disorder, like major depression, tends to run in families. It is more common in women than in men, but in men it may be underdiagnosed because men are less likely to talk to their doctors about their mood. Some people with persistent depressive disorder have experienced a major loss in childhood, such as the death of a parent. Others describe being under chronic stress. But it is often hard to know whether people with the disorder are under more stress than other people or if the disorder causes them to perceive more stress than others do.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptom of persistent depressive disorder is a long-lasting low or sad mood. Children and adolescents with persistent depressive disorder may be irritable. Other symptoms include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Many primary care doctors can recognize when one of their patients has some form of depression, which may lead to a referral to a mental health professional for a full evaluation. Clinicians diagnose the depression as persistent depressive disorder when an adult has had low mood, along with some of the other depressive symptoms, for two years or more. (In children, presistent depressive disorder may be diagnosed after one year of symptoms.)\nIt is not necessary to wait for two years before getting help! Someone who has symptoms for less than two years may still be treated for any persistent or distressing symptoms.\nSince many people with this disorder are embarrassed or ashamed to be labeled \"depressed,\" they may be reluctant to raise the subject with a clinician.\nSometimes the symptoms are the leading edge of another one of the mood disorders, such as\nThere are no laboratory tests to diagnose persistent depressive disorder. (However, a doctor may order tests to investigate medical conditions that can be a cause of depressive symptoms, such as thyroid disease or anemia.)\n",
      "Expected duration": "Persistent depressive disorder can start early in life, even in childhood. There can be ups and downs in mood, but lower moods dominate and are persistent. Treatment can reduce how long it lasts and the intensity of the symptoms.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no known way to prevent persistent depressive disorder.\n",
      "Treatment": "The best treatment is a combination of psychotherapy and medication.\nThe most helpful type of psychotherapy depends on a number of factors, including the nature of any stressful events, the availability of family and other social support, and personal preference. Therapy will usually include emotional support and education about depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy is designed to examine and help correct faulty, self-critical thought patterns. Psychodynamic, insight-oriented or interpersonal psychotherapy can help a person sort out conflicts in important relationships or explore the history behind the symptoms.\nPeople with persistent depressive disorder who think that \"feeling blue\" is just part of their life may be surprised to learn that antidepressant medication can be very helpful. Antidepressants recommended for this disorder are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs such as fluoxetine), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs such as venlafaxine), mirtazapine and bupropion.\nSide effects vary among these choices. Problems with sexual functioning are common in most except bupropion. Anxiety may increase in the early stages of treatment, although that feeling usually subsides. Although it is relatively uncommon, any psychoactive medication can make a person feel worse rather than better. Based on concerns that in rare cases these drugs can cause the onset of suicidal thinking, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required antidepressant manufacturers to put prominent warning labels on their products.\nThe scientific community continues to debate how great the risk of suicide is when antidepressant treatment is started. Many experts take the position that — in the population as a whole — antidepressant treatment has reduced the number of suicides. They worry that the black box warnings have scared off people who might otherwise benefit from the drugs. Others note that doctors and patients should stay alert to the possibility that suicidal thinking can be triggered by an antidepressant. Both arguments have merit.\nIn fact, the risk of leaving depression untreated is probably far greater than the risk of treatment with an antidepressant. But a small number of people using the medications do feel strikingly worse rather than better when they take them. The best way to avoid danger is to monitor your response to any medication carefully. You should therefore keep all follow-up appointments and immediately report any troubling changes to your doctor.\nOlder antidepressants — tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine inhibitors — are still in use and can be very effective for those who do not respond to the newer medications. In all, there are dozens of antidepressants available. Any may be worth trying depending on the situation.\nIt usually takes two to six weeks of antidepressant use to see improvement. The dose usually must be adjusted to find the right dose for you. It can take up to a few months for the full positive effect to be seen.\nAlso, the first medication may not work for you. You may need to try several different antidepressants before finding one that provides relief.\nSometimes, two different antidepressant medications are prescribed together, or your doctor may add a drug from a different class to your treatment, for example, a mood stabilizer or antianxiety medication. Antipsychotic medication in low doses is occasionally very useful for symptoms that have otherwise been resistant to treatment. It can sometimes take persistence to find the combination that works best.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a health care professional if you suspect that you or a loved one has this disorder.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Treatment may improve the duration and intensity of symptoms. In many people, the symptoms go away completely. Without treatment, the illness is more likely to persist, the person is likely to have a reduced quality of life and has an increased risk of developing major depression.\nEven when treatment is successful, maintenance treatment often is required to prevent symptoms from returning.\n",

      "What is it?": "Dysuria is the medical term for pain or discomfort when urinating. Often described as a burning sensation, dysuria most commonly is caused by bacterial infections of the urinary tract.\nLower urinary tract infection (cystitis or bladder infection)— Dysuria is a common symptom of a bladder infection (cystitis). Cystitis is very common in women aged 20 to 50.\nAn infection often starts when bacteria enter the opening where urine comes out (urethra) during sexual intercourse. Bacteria also can enter the urethra in women and girls who wipe with toilet tissue from back to front. Once bacteria enter a woman's urethra, it only has to travel a short distance to the bladder.\nIn men over age 50, a bladder infection usually is associated with an enlarged prostate or prostate infection.\nUpper urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis or kidney infection)— A kidney usually becomes infected because bacteria have traveled to the kidney from an infection in the bladder. Kidney infections occur more commonly:\nPyelonephritis is more common in women than in men.\nUrethritis— Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra. It is usually caused by sexually transmitted diseases (such as chlamydia and gonorrhea). Urethritis also can be caused by contact with an irritating chemical (such as antiseptics, bubble bath or some spermicides) or by irritation from an object, such as a tube (catheter) inserted to drain urine.\nVaginitis— Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina. It can be caused by an allergic reaction to an irritating chemical (spermicide, douche, bath soap), a low level of estrogen after menopause, or an object such as a tampon that was not removed. It can also be caused by infection. Common infections include:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Depending on the cause of dysuria, there may be other symptoms in addition to pain when urinating. Symptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Many people have occasional episodes of brief discomfort when they start urinating. Usually this is caused by irritation, and does not need to be treated. However, you should see your health care professional if pain while urinating lasts longer, is severe or if it continues to happen.\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and personal and sexual habits. During a physical examination, the doctor will check for tenderness over the kidneys and examine your genitals. For women, this may include a pelvic exam. Men with suspected prostate problems may have a digital rectal exam.\nIf your doctor thinks you have a simple bladder infection, he or she usually can confirm this with a urine test in the doctor's office.\nTo diagnose urethritis and vaginitis, a swab of the infected area may need to be taken and sent for testing.\nIf your doctor suspects you have a kidney infection, a urine sample will be sent to a laboratory to identify the species of bacteria. If you have a fever or appear ill, a blood sample may be tested in a laboratory to check for bacteria in the blood.\nIf you have dysuria and a have had unprotected sex with multiple partners, your doctor may order tests to look for various types of sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis and HIV.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long dysuria lasts depends on its cause. Most people with infections of the urinary tract respond well to treatment within a few days. When the cause is more difficult to determine, symptoms may last longer.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent dysuria caused by cystitis or pyelonephritis, you can drink several glasses of water each day to flush out your urinary tract. Women should wipe from front to back after having a bowel movement. Also they should urinate soon after sexual intercourse to flush bacteria away from the urethra. This helps prevent the bacteria from moving into the bladder.\nTo prevent dysuria caused by irritation, women should keep the genital area clean and dry, change tampons and sanitary napkins frequently, and avoid using irritating soaps, vaginal sprays and douches. To avoid irritation in female children, limit bubble baths, wash girls thoroughly but gently after playing in sand and be wary of extended play in wet swimsuits, all of which can lead to irritation and redness of the vulva (vulvitis).\nTo help prevent dysuria caused by sexually transmitted diseases, practice safe sex. This includes always using a condom unless you have only one steady sexual partner.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment of dysuria depends on its cause:\nIf you are sexually active and are being treated for dysuria caused by a sexually transmitted disease, your sex partners must be treated, too.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor or seek urgent care if you have painful urination or blood in the urine and any these other symptoms:\n",
      "Prognosis": "A single episode of infection in the bladder, urethra, vagina or kidney usually goes away completely after treatment with antibiotics if treated promptly. In most cases, there is very little risk of long-term damage. However, women with certain sexually transmitted diseases can lead to scarring of the reproductive tract and fertility problems if not diagnosed and treated.\n",

      "What is it?": "Pain in one or both ears can occur for many reasons, some not related to the ear at all. When the pain is caused by an ear problem, the most common reason is blockage of the passageway between the middle ear and the back of the throat. This passageway is called the Eustachian tube.\nThe middle ear is the small, air-filled cavity just behind the paper-thin eardrum. Normally, air enters the middle ear through the Eustachian tube, equalizing the pressure between the middle ear and outer ear. The Eustachian tube also drains fluid out of the middle ear. When this tube becomes blocked, and air and fluid cannot flow freely, pressure builds in the ear, causing pain.\nIf fluid behind the eardrum becomes infected with a virus or bacteria, it causes a middle ear infection that can lead to pain and fever.\nOther causes of pain related to the ear include:\nPain from a sore throat or a problem with the jaw joints called temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ) may be felt in the ear.\nWhen too much wax blocks the ear, you may feel pressure, but this usually doesn't cause pain.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Earache is most commonly described as a feeling of pressure in the ear. This feeling may begin gradually or suddenly, and it can be very severe. Other symptoms such as hearing loss, fever and feeling unwell usually indicate an ear infection.\nWhen the ear canal is inflamed or if the eardrum ruptures, there may be drainage from the ear. If the eardrum ruptures because of a middle ear infection, the pain is often relieved because the pressure is reduced. In young children, the only signs of an ear infection may be fever, irritability and pulling at the ear.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Adults and older children with mild ear pain or pressure who do not have a fever or hearing loss usually do not need to see a doctor. This type of pain usually is caused by a blocked Eustachian tube.\nIf the ear pain is more severe, or there are other symptoms, it's a good idea to see a health professional. Your doctor will examine your ears, nose and throat, and use a device called an otoscope (a lighted instrument) to look inside the ears and check for redness and fluid buildup behind the eardrum. The doctor may blow a puff of air through the otoscope into your eye to see if the eardrum moves normally.\nYour doctor may test your hearing. One way is to check how well you can hear fingers rubbed together near your ear.\n",
      "Expected duration": "An earache will continue until the problem causing it goes away or is treated. If the pain is due to a blocked Eustachian tube, an over-the-counter decongestant may help open it up. Acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) or naproxen (Aleve) will decrease pain until the underlying condition is treated or goes away.\n",
      "Prevention": "Some people, particularly young children, are prone to recurring earaches. If a child continues to have frequent ear infections, the doctor may surgically insert a ventilation tube into the eardrum to prevent the ear from becoming blocked.\nChildren are more prone to earaches if they: Breastfed infants are less likely to develop ear infections because breast milk contains antibodies that help to protect the baby from infection. Also, when a baby sucks on a bottle, the fluid is more likely to get pulled into the Eustachian tube, particularly if the infant drinks from a bottle while lying on his or her back. For this reason, it is better to hold the baby at least semi-erect during feeding.\n",
      "Treatment": "Over-the-counter pain relievers will usually be enough to control pain. Examples include acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen. Resting the infected ear on a warm (not hot) heating pad can provide some relief. For a blocked Eustachian tube, drugs commonly used include decongestants and antihistamines.\nChildren with earaches and fever should not take aspirin without a doctor's approval because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal illness that can occur in children who have certain viral infections.\nIf you have an ear infection, antibiotics may not be needed. A trial of a decongestant and pain medicine may be sufficient. However, if the symptoms are not getting better after a few days or they are quickly getting worse, contact your doctor to discuss treatment with an antibiotic. If the symptoms are severe when you first see your doctor, he or she may advise starting an antibiotic right away.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you or your child has a fever or hearing loss with an earache. See a doctor if you develop ear pressure that lasts for several days, even if you don't have other symptoms.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most earaches resolve within several days. Even with more prolonged ear infections, the outlook is positive.\n",

      "Symptoms of eczema": "Short-term symptoms of eczema include itchy skin, redness and tiny bumps or blisters.\nIf these symptoms remain untreated, the skin can become thick, scaly and dry. There can be areas of hair loss and color changes. Skin affected by long-term eczema is more vulnerable to secondary infections.\nEach type of eczema has specific characteristics and patterns of symptoms:\nWhen triggered by an allergic reaction, it usually causes skin redness, fine red bumps or blisters and severe itching.\nA reaction caused by plant allergies (like poison ivy or poison oak) is usually intense.

      "Preventing eczema": "There are many things you can do to prevent or reduce eczema flare-ups.\nTo help to prevent contact dermatitis, avoid skin contact with:\n",
      "Treating eczema": "Your doctor should review your skin care routine. Your doctor can ensure you are doing everything possible to prevent symptoms.\nBut sometimes eczema remains bothersome despite these measures.\nYour doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid ointment or cream. In atopic dermatitis, mild or medium strength topical steroids generally are used. These are applied to the affected areas of the skin.\nWhen topical corticosteroids are not sufficient or needed for long periods of time to control atopic dermatitis, your doctor may prescribe a topical calcineurin inhibitor. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus topical agents are approved for use in children older than 2 years of age.\nStrong steroids and oral antihistamines may be needed to treat allergic contact dermatitis.\nIf there are signs of bacterial skin infection, oral antibiotics usually are needed.\nSometimes, in very severe cases of eczema, your doctor will prescribe a short course of oral steroids or stronger immunosuppressants. However, these medications can have serious side effects. They must be used cautiously.\nIn some people, treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light is another option.\nSeborrhea in adults is best treated with dandruff shampoo. Occasionally prescription antifungal facial creams or rinses may be needed.\nCradle cap in infants eventually clears up without treatment. However, it can last several months. The crust usually can be loosened. To do so, apply baby oil to the scalp 30 to 60 minutes before brushing with a soft brush. Then wash with baby shampoo.\nWhen treating a contact allergy in a child, avoid topical treatments containing antihistamines. Skin reactions can occur.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have an area of skin that is red and very itchy. Also call if your skin is cracked, blistered or painfully dry.\nAsk your doctor for an urgent evaluation if you have signs of infection. These include an area of skin that:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis varies from person to person. It depends on the type of eczema and its response to treatment.\nMost contact dermatitis heals within two to three weeks. Most stasis dermatitis lasts for years.\nAbout half of children with atopic eczema still have the problem as adults.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Edema is swelling of both legs from a buildup of extra fluid. Edema has many possible causes:\nProlonged standing or sitting, especially in hot weather, can cause excess fluid to accumulate in the feet, ankles and lower legs.\nTiny valves inside the veins of the legs can become weakened, causing a common problem called venous insufficiency. This problem makes it more difficult for the veins to pump blood back to the heart, and leads to varicose veins and buildup of fluid.\nSevere chronic (long-term) lung diseases, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, increase pressure in the blood vessels that lead from the heart to the lungs. This pressure backs up in the heart. The higher pressure causes swelling in the legs and feet.\nCongestive heart failure, a condition in which the heart can no longer pump efficiently, causes fluid buildup in the lungs and other parts of the body. Swelling is often most visible in the feet and ankles.\nPregnancy can cause edema in the legs as the uterus puts pressure on the vena cava, a major blood vessel that returns blood to the heart from the legs. Fluid retention during pregnancy also can be caused by a more serious condition called preeclampsia.\nLow protein levels in the blood caused by malnutrition, kidney and liver disease can cause edema. The proteins help to hold salt and water inside the blood vessels so fluid does not leak out into the tissues. If a blood protein, called albumin, gets too low, fluid is retained and edema occurs, especially in the feet, ankles and lower legs.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary according to the type of edema and its location. In general, the skin above the swollen area will be stretched and shiny.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "To check for edema that is not obvious, you can gently press your thumb over the foot, ankle or leg with slow, steady pressure. If you have edema, you will see an indentation where you pressed. You should see a doctor to determine the cause of leg swelling. If both legs are swollen, your doctor will ask about other symptoms and will examine you. A urine test will show if you are losing protein from the kidneys. Blood tests, a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram (EKG) also may be done.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Edema can be temporary or permanent, and it can come and go depending on the cause.\n",
      "Prevention": "The only way to prevent edema is to prevent the cause. Smoking is the main cause of chronic lung disease. Congestive heart failure most often is caused by coronary artery disease, high blood pressure or drinking too much alcohol. To avoid leg swelling on long trips, stand up and walk around often. Ideally, you should get up once an hour. If that's not possible, then exercise your feet and lower legs while sitting. This will help the veins move blood back toward the heart.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment of edema focuses on correcting the cause of the fluid accumulation. A low-salt diet usually helps. You also should avoid drinking too much fluid. If you are not short of breath, elevate your legs above the level of your heart to keep swelling down. Your doctor might suggest that you take a low dose of a diuretic (water pill).\nFor swollen ankles and feet caused by pregnancy, elevate your legs and avoid lying on your back to help improve blood flow and decrease swelling.\nIf you have mild leg edema caused by venous insufficiency, elevate your legs periodically and wear support (compression) stockings. Sometimes surgery is needed to improve the flow of blood through the leg veins.\nNo matter what the cause of edema, any swollen area of the body should be protected from pressure, injury and extreme temperatures. The skin over swollen legs becomes more fragile over time. Cuts, scrapes and burns in areas that have edema take much longer to heal and are more likely to get infected.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you have pain, redness or heat in a swollen area, an open sore, shortness of breath or swelling of only one limb.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for edema of the legs depends on the cause. For most people with edema, the prognosis is excellent.\n",

      "What is it?": "Emphysema is a respiratory disease. In this condition, millions of the lungs' tiny air sacs (alveoli) stretch out of shape or rupture. As these thin, fragile air sacs become damaged or destroyed, the lungs lose their natural elasticity. They become unable to empty easily.\nEmphysema is a progressive disease, which means it continues to get worse. As the condition progresses, the lungs lose their ability to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Breathing becomes more difficult. A person feels easily short of breath, like he or she is not getting enough air.\nEmphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They often occur together. Bronchitis is an inflammation and swelling of the bronchial walls. A person with chronic bronchitis typically has a daily cough with phlegm that lasts for months at a time over several years.\nSmoking is responsible for the vast majority of cases of emphysema. Exposure to secondhand smoke and airborne toxins also can contribute to emphysema, though to a much lesser degree. Smokers exposed to high levels of air pollution appear to be at higher risk of developing COPD.\nBoth emphysema and chronic bronchitis are caused by damage to the lungs and bronchial tubes. When the damage is caused by smoking, symptoms may improve after a smoker quits.\nA small number of people in the United States develop emphysema from an inherited disease known as alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In this genetic condition, the body doesn't make enough of a protein called alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT). AAT protects the lungs from damage by enzymes. When levels of AAT are low, the lungs are prone to being damaged by these enzymes. Smoking makes this condition worse.\n",
      "Symptoms": "During the early stages of emphysema, most people will have few symptoms. The disease usually progresses slowly. Changes in breathing may be hardly noticed. A typical person will not experience symptoms until they have smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for more than 20 years.\nHowever, over time, almost all people with emphysema will develop shortness of breath. At first, this may be noticed only during strenuous activities, such as climbing several flights of stairs or playing sports. As time goes on, the shortness of breath may occur with daily activities, such as housework or walking short distances. Eventually, the person may be short of breath for much of the day, even while at rest or sleeping. At its worst, emphysema can cause \"air hunger.\" This is the constant feeling of being unable to catch one's breath.\nThese respiratory symptoms are the same regardless of the cause of the emphysema. However, two people with the same degree of lung damage may have different symptoms. One person with mild emphysema may feel very short of breath. Another person with more advanced stages of the disease may be hardly bothered by symptoms.\nOther symptoms caused by emphysema include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask for details about your smoking. He or she will ask how long you've smoked, and how many cigarettes per day.\nOther questions may include:\nYour doctor also will ask about your respiratory symptoms. He or she will want to know if and when you develop shortness of breath. The doctor also may wish to ask about:\nYour doctor then will examine you to look for typical signs of emphysema. This may include:\nThe results of this examination may be totally normal in many people in the earliest stages of emphysema.\nIn most people, emphysema will be diagnosed by X-ray or lung-function tests.\nA regular chest X-ray may show typical changes of emphysema. These include:\nHowever, these changes may not appear until significant damage has occurred. Computed tomography (CT) scans are better for detecting the earliest changes of emphysema. CT scans may help to diagnose the disease in younger people or those who have never smoked.\nPulmonary function testing is useful both to diagnose emphysema and to determine the stage of the disease. This test is also known as spirometry. In this test you will blow forcefully through a tube. The tube is connected to a machine that measures your lung capacity.\nYour doctor also may order specialized lung tests. These may require you to sit inside a glass box, or slowly breathe in a mixture of different gases.\nOther tests your doctor may order include:\nIf suspected, your doctor can order a blood test to confirm the diagnosis of AAT deficiency. If this test is positive, your doctor may recommend screening for your entire family.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Regardless of the cause, lung damage in emphysema cannot be reversed. If the disease is not treated, damage and symptoms will continue to get worse. If treated, the symptoms can improve.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you smoke, stop. If you don't smoke, don't start. By quitting smoking you can either prevent emphysema or slow its progression.\nYou also should limit your exposure to air pollution. Restrict your outdoor activity when there are reports of high smog levels.\nPeople exposed to harmful chemicals at work should speak to their employers about respirator masks. Or, consult with a specialist in occupational medicine.\nIf you have emphysema, ask your doctor about vaccinations against influenza (flu) and pneumococcal pneumonia. These vaccinations can help to prevent life-threatening respiratory infections in people with lung disease.\n",
      "Treatment": "No treatment can reverse or stop emphysema. But treatment can help to:\nDoctors' top treatment advice is to quit smoking. This is the single most important factor for maintaining healthy lungs. Stopping smoking is most effective at the early stages of emphysema. But it also can slow the loss of lung function in later stages of the disease.\nPeople with AAT deficiency may be candidates for replacement therapy. This is done with infusions of natural AAT obtained from donors. This form of treatment appears effective. But it is time consuming and very expensive.\nYour doctor may prescribe a number of different medications. These can help to relieve symptoms. Medications may include:\nThese medications are taken through hand-held inhalers or machine-driven nebulizers. These create a fine mist that can be inhaled.\nBronchodilators help to open the bronchial tubes in your lungs. By doing so, they reduce shortness of breath, wheezing and cough.\nTheophylline (sold under several brand names) is a pill form of a bronchodilator. Because it can interact with medications and cause side effects, it is used less often than the inhaler medications.\nInhaled corticosteroids or pills may be prescribed for daily use. They help control the inflammation of chronic bronchitis.\nThese combination products provide both anti-inflammatory action and airway opening in one inhaler.\nOxygen therapyincreases life expectancy in people with emphysema who have below-normal levels of oxygen in the blood. Oxygen usually is given through a plastic tube (nasal cannula) worn under the nostrils. The oxygen may be stored in metal cylinders. Or, it may be purified from air by an oxygen concentrator.\nA number of lightweight, portable devices are available. They allow those who need oxygen to leave their homes for hours at a time.\nSome people with emphysema need oxygen only at night.\nSupplying oxygen at home is very expensive. As a result, most medical insurance companies have strict requirements to qualify for home oxygen.\nPeople with emphysema also are at risk of becoming malnourished. It is important to see your doctor regularly about an appropriate diet. They are also at risk for developing psychological problems such as anxiety or depression. Counseling or medications can help.\nPulmonary rehabilitationis a form of physical therapy. It includes a structured exercise program combined with special breathing techniques, psychological support and education. It helps people with emphysema:\nOther treatments may be considered for people with advanced stages of emphysema.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you develop:\nIf you smoke, see your doctor about ways to quit. Several different types of treatment can increase your likelihood of success compared to \"going cold turkey.\" These include medications and counseling.\nYou also should see your doctor if anyone in your family has been diagnosed with AAT deficiency.\n",
      "Prognosis": "There is no cure for emphysema. But the condition can be controlled.\nPeople with mild emphysema who quit smoking have a normal life expectancy. Those who adopt good health habits can enjoy a fairly normal lifestyle for a long time. Even people whose emphysema is severe have a good chance of surviving for five years or more.\nIn people with emphysema who continue to smoke, smoking dramatically increases the severity of the illness. It may reduce life span by 10 years or more.\n",

      "What is it?": "Encephalitis means inflammation of the brain. This inflammation usually is triggered by a viral infection, although sometimes it can be caused by a bacterial infection of the brain, such as Lyme disease. In some cases, symptoms are caused by direct infection of the brain. In other cases, the brain inflammation is caused by the immune system's response to the brain infection. Even if the immune system attack succeeds in eliminating the infection, it may injure the brain in the process. This is called post-infectious encephalitis.\nOften, viruses that cause encephalitis also cause inflammation of the delicate tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord, which are called the meninges. This condition is meningitis. When encephalitis and meningitis occur together, it is called meningoencephalitis.\nOf the many different viruses that can cause meningoencephalitis, enteroviruses (particularly coxsackievirus and echovirus) are the most common cause in the United States, particularly if the illness occurs in the summer or fall. Encephalitis also can be caused by the herpes simplex virus, which also causes cold sores and genital herpes. This type of encephalitis is less common but tends to be more severe. The mumps and measles viruses also can cause encephalitis, with mumps occurring most often in the winter or spring.\nOther viruses that can cause encephalitis include several related viruses: varicella-zoster virus (the cause of chickenpox and shingles), cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis) and human herpesvirus-6 (a cause of transient encephalitis in very young children). HIV also can cause encephalitis, particularly in the early stages of infection.\nOther viruses that cause encephalitis are transmitted directly or indirectly from animals to humans. Arboviruses are indirectly transmitted from animals and birds to humans by insects, especially mosquitoes and ticks.\nThe West Nile virus is an arbovirus that commonly infects birds. Mosquitoes that bite an infected bird and then bite a human can transmit the virus. Most people infected with the West Nile virus don't develop encephalitis symptoms. If they do, they usually recover. This virus does not spread directly from human to human.\nArboviruses that can infect horses are called equine viruses, such as Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE or triple E). A mosquito that bites an infected horse can carry the virus to a human. Fortunately, human infection is rare because, unlike West Nile virus infection in humans, triple E infection is often much more serious. Like West Nile, triple E does not spread through direct contact with an infected human.\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus rarely infects humans. When it does, it can occur through contact with small animals.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of encephalitis range from mild to severe and can be life-threatening. Fortunately, most cases are not severe. Possible symptoms, beginning with the two most common, include the following:\nMany of these symptoms also occur in other conditions that affect the brain, including migraine headaches and life-threatening conditions such as bleeding in the brain. When a person has a fever along with the other symptoms, some kind of infection is most likely.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If your doctor suspects you have encephalitis, he or she will order tests such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain. A procedure called a lumbar puncture or spinal tap may be used to draw fluid from the spine and test it to determine what virus is causing the encephalitis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Encephalitis can last from a few days to several months, depending on the virus involved and the severity of the case.\n",
      "Prevention": "When outbreaks of insect-borne encephalitis occur, people in the affected communities should remove pools of standing water, where mosquitoes can breed, and should use insect repellent. The most effective insect repellents contain a chemical called DEET. Travelers can be given vaccines against one cause, Japanese B encephalitis, which is common in Japan and other parts of Asia.\n",
      "Treatment": "Antiviral drugs, such as intravenous acyclovir, are often given when encephalitis is initially diagnosed, even before the cause is known. Acyclovir is the best treatment for herpes simplex encephalitis. If the drug can be started soon after symptoms begin, the chance of full recovery is much better. Without acyclovir treatment, herpes encephalitis can cause severe permanent brain damage. Antiviral drugs don't have much effect on the other viral agents that cause encephalitis.\nEncephalitis caused by Lyme disease is treated with intravenous antibiotics, usually ceftriaxone.\nOther treatments are known as supportive therapies. These include drugs to reduce fever, relieve headache, and treat seizures if they occur.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact a doctor if someone in your family suddenly becomes confused, is very hard to arouse, seems to have lost consciousness, or has severe headaches. Whether these symptoms are caused by encephalitis or another condition, they require immediate medical attention. In babies, a bulge in the fontanelle (the soft spot of the skull) is another important warning sign.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Encephalitis is most dangerous in babies and senior citizens, but it can be serious and even fatal in people of all ages. With severe cases, recovery is slow and may involve therapy to regain certain skills. The prospects for a complete recovery vary depending on the type of virus involved.\nEncephalitis from the herpes virus can cause permanent injury. Eastern equine encephalitis is rare, with fewer than 10 cases per year in the United States. However, 50% to 60% of cases are fatal, and most survivors have permanent brain damage.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Encopresis is when a child who is toilet trained passes stool (bowel movements) into his or her underwear. To have encopresis, the child must be at least four years old, the age by which most children can control bowel movements. Encopresis is also called fecal incontinence.\nIn most children, encopresis is related to chronic constipation. Constipation is when bowel movements don't occur often enough. Also, the stool is hard and dry.\nWhen stool needs to be passed, it collects in the lower bowel (rectum). There, it stretches the bowel wall. This feeling of the bowel being stretched is what normally makes us realize we have to go to the bathroom.\nHowever, if the bowel wall is stretched for long periods without passing a bowel movement, the rectum loses its normal muscle tone and feeling. This makes it harder and harder to pass the hard stool collecting in the rectum. Also it becomes more difficult for your child to know when stool is ready to be passed.\nAs newer stool continues to be made in the intestines, it leaks around the large chunk of hard stool. It passes out of the rectum, and soils the child's underpants. In almost all children with encopresis caused by constipation, this is not done on purpose. In fact, many children do not even realize that the stool has leaked out. The first clue that the child has a problem may come when someone notices that the child smells bad.\nChronic constipation that turns into encopresis can have many different causes. These include:\nTension and anxiety because of problems during toilet training\nA diet that is low in fiber, found in:\nFruits\nVegetables\nWhole grains\nWhole milk\nCheese\nWhite rice\nWhite bread\nNot drinking enough liquids\nFear and anxiety about using an unfamiliar bathroom (for example, at school)\nNot paying attention to the feeling (urge) that it's time to have a bowel movement: Some children do not go to the bathroom when they have the urge to do so. They might be too busy playing a game, watching television or doing some other engaging activity. At school, they may be afraid to ask for permission to leave class to use the bathroom.\nA fissure. When a child with constipation finally passes a bowel movement, the abnormally large stool may injure the skin of his or her rectum. This can produce a painful tear in the skin called a fissure. Because of this painful fissure, the child may become more and more anxious about having a bowel movement for fear of pain.\nHypothyroidism. Having low levels of thyroid hormones can make a child's digestive system function more slowly than normal. This can lead to constipation.\nNo matter what the initial cause of a child's chronic constipation, the end result is the same. A large chunk of stool builds up and stretches the rectum until it loses its normal tone and feeling. This makes it more difficult for the rectum to push out the stool. So, more and more stool builds up.\nThis unhealthy cycle can only be broken when the bowel is completely cleared of stool. At that point, the bowel can return to its normal size. Then a child can learn how to empty his or her bowel on a more regular schedule.\nIn rare cases, encopresis is related to:\nMedical problems involving the nerves in the spine or the bowel wall\nPsychological issues, such as:\nAnger\nAbnormally impulsive behavior\nGrief over the death of a loved one\nSome other stress or history of trauma\nBoys have encopresis more often than girls.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In most children with encopresis, the most obvious signs are:\nOther signs and symptoms may include:\nPeriods of constipation (no bowel movements) alternating with very large bowel movements\nStreaks of blood on the outside of stool, or on toilet tissue used to wipe after a bowel movement\nPain in the lower abdomen or rectum\nStool-stained clothes hidden in closets, under the bed or elsewhere\nBedwetting, probably related to pressure from the large chunk of stool in the rectum\nIn rarer cases, when encopresis is caused by serious psychological problems, a child may drop or smear stool on floors, walls or furniture.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The doctor will begin by asking about your child's bowel habits, including:\nThe doctor also will ask about your child's diet, especially about:\nFoods that tend to cause constipation:\nMilk and other dairy products,, white rice, white bread\nHigh-fiber foods, which help to keep stools soft:\nFruits, vegetables, whole grains\nSome doctors ask parents to keep a diary of the child's diet and stools for a week. This can help to figure out how best to treat the child. The doctor also will want to know about any unusual stresses in your child's life, either at home or at school.\nThe doctor will examine your child. He or she will look for any physical abnormalities in your child's abdomen, genital area or lower spine. He or she also may examine your child's rectum to look for any fissures or other abnormalities. The doctor may check to see how much stool is in the rectum.\nIn most cases, your doctor can diagnose encopresis based on your child's:\nUsually no further tests are necessary.  Sometimes an x-ray is done of the abdomen to see how much stool is present.\nIf the doctor thinks the problem may be related to abnormalities in your child's lower digestive tract, he or she may order additional tests. These may include an X-ray procedure called a barium enema or a procedure called a rectal biopsy.\nIn a biopsy, a small piece of tissue from the rectum is removed to be examined in a laboratory.\nIf your child has signs of hypothyroidism, your doctor may order blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "With treatment, most children will recover from encopresis.  The length of treatment varies greatly depending on the child and the circumstances. Almost all children with encopresis stop soiling by the time they reach their mid-teen years.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent encopresis caused by chronic constipation, you can:\nRemember, even after your child has become completely toilet trained, occasional accidents will happen. It is important that you remain calm and casual as you change your child's soiled clothing. Try not to show disgust, disappointment or frustration with your child.\n",
      "Treatment": "If your child has encopresis because of chronic constipation, treatment is a three-step process. It involves:\nYour doctor also may suggest that you try motivating your child.  One example is to use a \"token and reward system.\" This typically involves using a colorful chart to keep track of your child's progress. A gold star or sticker is awarded for every \"clean\" day. When the chart is filled, your child will earn some sort of reward.  Every child is different when it comes to what motivates them to change.\nIf your child has encopresis because of a neurological or developmental problem involving the digestive tract, your doctor will refer you to a specialist for treatment. The specialist may be a neurologist or gastroenterologist.\nIf your child's encopresis seems to be related to serious psychological problems, your doctor most likely will refer your child to a psychiatrist or other mental health professional.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Call your doctor if your child is older than age four and consistently soils his pants with stool. Also call if your child has started soiling after being clean for many months or years. Call your doctor if your child frequently has constipation, even if he or she is not having a problem with encopresis.\nCall your doctor immediately if your child begins to intentionally drop or smear stool anywhere, including around the home or school.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most children with encopresis either outgrow the problem or respond to treatment. Treatment may involve changes in diet, medication and motivational therapy.\nWhen encopresis is related to psychological or emotional problems, treatment may take longer.\n",

      "What is end-stage renal disease?": "End-stage renal disease is a condition in which the kidneys no longer function normally. Renal describes anything having to do with the kidneys. Nearly everyone is born with two kidneys. They both need to fail for end-stage renal disease to develop.\nKidneys eliminate poisons from the body and keep a normal balance of fluid and certain minerals in the body. When the kidneys can no longer perform this function, a person becomes seriously ill and ultimately dies.\nIn end-stage renal disease, the kidneys function at a fraction of their normal capacity. When this occurs, there are only two options:\nDiabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Kidney disease can result from type 1 or type 2 diabetes. With either type, poor control of blood sugar increases the risk of end-stage renal disease.\nOther common causes of end-stage renal disease are:\n\n",
      "Symptoms of end-stage renal disease": "Symptoms of end-stage renal disease include:\nSymptoms may remain mild or absent until kidney function drops to less than 20% of normal.\nDialysis is urgent when one or more of the following occurs:\nDialysis may also be necessary if symptoms affect quality of life or nutritional status. This is especially true if they are accompanied by severely abnormal blood tests.\n",
      "Diagnosing end-stage renal disease": "Kidney disease is diagnosed through urine and blood tests. These tests measure levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen in the urine and blood.\nAdditional tests may be necessary to determine why the kidneys have stopped working. For example, a kidney biopsy may be recommended, in which a tiny sample of kidney tissue is removed and carefully examined under a microscope.\n",
      "Expected duration of end-stage renal disease": "End-stage renal disease is almost always a lifelong condition unless a kidney transplant is done. Even with a successful transplant, a person must take medicine for the rest of his or her life.\n",
      "Preventing end-stage renal disease": "You can take steps to reduce your risk of developing end-stage renal disease:\n",
      "Treating end-stage renal disease": "The two treatments for end-stage renal disease are dialysis and kidney transplant.\n",
      "Dialysis": "There are two types of dialysis:\n\n\n",
      "Kidney transplants": "Kidney transplants allow people with severe kidney disease to avoid or discontinue dialysis.\nAnyone who receives a kidney transplant must take immunosuppressive drugs for life, unless they received a kidney donated by their identical twin. These are drugs that prevent the body from rejecting the donated organ. In addition, a good genetic match is needed for a successful transplant. Most transplant candidates wait one to three to five years before a good genetic match can be found from an unrelated donor.\n\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should have regular checkups if you have:\nThese checkups should include urine and blood tests to measure your kidney function.\nWhen blood tests indicate kidney disease, your doctor should refer you to a kidney specialist. This specialist is called a nephrologist.\nCall your doctor if you notice any decrease in urination or other symptoms of end-stage renal disease. Be particularly vigilant if you have kidney disease or its risk factors.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Treatments for end-stage renal disease offer hope for good recovery and quality of life. Although people requiring dialysis or who have had a kidney transplant have a somewhat shorter average lifespan than the general population, they can lead near normal lives for many years.\n",

      "What is it?": "Endocarditis, also called infective endocarditis, is an infection and inflammation of the heart valves and the inner lining of the heart chambers, which is called the endocardium. Endocarditis occurs when infectious organisms, such as bacteria or fungi, enter the bloodstream and settle in the heart. In most cases, these organisms arestreptococci(andquot;strep\"),staphylococci(andquot;staph\") or species of bacteria that normally live on body surfaces.\nThe infecting organism enters the bloodstream through a break in the skin caused by a skin disorder or injury; a medical or dental procedure; or a skin prick, especially among intravenous drug users.\nDepending on the aggressiveness (virulence) of the infecting germ, the heart damage caused by endocarditis can be swift and severe (acute endocarditis) or slower and less dramatic (subacute endocarditis).\nMen develop endocarditis more often than women, and the illness is more common among people who have one or more of the following risk factors:\nIn about 20% to 40% of patients who do not have artificial heart valves and who do not use intravenous drugs, no heart problem can be identified that would increase their risk of endocarditis. In the 10% to 20% of endocarditis patients who have artificial heart valves, infections that follow within 60 days of valve surgery often are caused by a staphylococcus, while endocarditis that occurs later most frequently is caused by a streptococcus.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of acute endocarditis include:\nSymptoms of subacute endocarditis include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will review your medical history with particular attention to possible risk factors for endocarditis, including congenital heart disease, rheumatic fever, an artificial heart valve or pacemaker, a history of IV drug use, and a history of chronic illness. Your doctor also will ask whether you have ever been told that you have a heart murmur and whether you have had any recent medical or dental procedure in which bacteria might have had an opportunity to entire your bloodstream (dental scaling, periodontal surgery, professional teeth cleaning, bronchoscopy, certain diagnostic tests of the genitourinary tract, colonoscopy).\nYour doctor will examine you, and will check for fever; skin symptoms of endocarditis (tiny hemorrhages in the skin, tender nodules on finger and toes); and a heart murmur, which indicates possible heart valve damage. Additional testing includes:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Symptoms of acute endocarditis usually begin suddenly and get worse quickly. It is an infection that can develop dramatically over a few days. Subacute endocarditis develops more slowly, and its milder symptoms can be present for weeks or months before the illness is suspected.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you are at high risk of endocarditis because of a damaged heart valve or other medical problem, tell your doctor and dentist. To prevent endocarditis, your doctor and dentist may prescribe antibiotics before you have any medical or dental procedure in which bacteria have a chance of entering your blood. This is called prophylactic antibiotics.\nProphylactic antibiotics usually are given to people with artificial valves, people who had endocarditis in the past and people with other high-risk conditions. Most people with mitral valve prolapse and other minor abnormalities of heart structure do not need antibiotics before medical or dental procedures.\nIn general, antibiotics are given one to two hours before a high-risk procedure, and up to eight hours afterward. Before a dental procedure, an antiseptic mouth rinse also can be used, especially one containing chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine.\nYou also can help to prevent endocarditis by avoiding IV drug use.\n",
      "Treatment": "When endocarditis is caused by a bacterial infection, it usually is treated with four to six weeks of antibiotics. The type of antibiotic and the length of therapy depend on the results of the blood cultures. Antibiotic treatment is given intravenously (through a vein). Treatment is almost always started while you are in the hospital. When your doctor determines it is safe, you can be discharged home to finish the course of intravenous antibiotics.\nSometimes the infected heart valve must be replaced surgically. Indications for surgery may include:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you experience symptoms of acute or subacute endocarditis, especially if you have a history of heart valve damage, a known heart murmur or an implanted device in your heart (artificial valve or pacemaker wire).\n",
      "Prognosis": "With prompt diagnosis and proper medical treatment, over 90% of patients with bacterial endocarditis recover. Those whose endocarditis affects the right side of the heart tend to have a better outlook than those with left-side involvement. In cases in which endocarditis is caused by fungi, the prognosis is usually worse than for bacterial endocarditis.\nSome possible complications of endocarditis include:\nIf endocarditis remains untreated, it can cause severe permanent disability and death.\n",

      "What is endometriosis?": "Endometrial tissue lines the inside of the uterus. In endometriosis, the same type of tissue also grows in places outside of the uterus.\nImplants or patches of endometriosis may develop in the:\nMisplaced endometrial tissue behaves like endometrial tissue in the uterus. It responds to the monthly rise and fall of female hormones. At the time of menstruation, endometrial tissue outside the uterus also can ooze blood, and cause pelvic or abdominal pain.\nIf the misplaced endometrial tissue enlarges to cover or grow into the ovaries, or if it blocks the fallopian tubes, it can it can interfere with a woman's fertility by blocking the passage of an egg from the ovaries into the uterus.\nEndometrial tissue on the ovaries may form into large fluid-filled cysts. These are called endometriomas.\n\nA woman may have an increased risk of endometriosis if:\nA woman's risk may be lower than average if:\n",
      "Symptoms of endometriosis": "Many women with endometriosis do not have any symptoms from it. Those who have symptoms may experience:\n",
      "Diagnosing endometriosis": "The doctor will review:\nThis will be followed by a physical exam and a pelvic exam.\nDuring the pelvic exam, your doctor may be able to feel the following signs of endometriosis.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may need to do pelvic laparoscopic surgery. In this surgery, doctors operate through two or three tiny incisions. The surgery can identify endometrial tissue inside your pelvis or abdomen. Abnormal tissue may be removed for biopsy during the surgery.\n",
      "Expected duration of endometriosis": "Without treatment, endometriosis is a long-term problem. It usually lasts until menopause. After menopause, areas of misplaced endometrial tissue tend to become smaller, and are less likely to cause symptoms. That is particularly true if your symptoms have come only during menstrual periods.\n",
      "Preventing endometriosis": "There is no way to prevent endometriosis.\nThe condition may temporarily stop progressing if you:\n",
      "Treating endometriosis": "Several treatment options are available.\n",
      "Pain management": "For mild pelvic or abdominal pain, you may try a nonprescription pain medication. Examples include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). If this doesn't help, your doctor may suggest a prescription-strength nonsteroidal pain reliever.\nStronger medications that contain a mild narcotic are available. But narcotics pose a risk of drug dependence and addiction. They are prescribed only when other pain medications fail or can't be used because of side effects or allergic reactions.\n",
      "Treatments that control hormone levels": "Some treatments relieve pain by controlling levels of female hormones, particularly if your symptoms occur mainly or only during menstrual periods. These include:\n",
      "Conservative surgical treatments": "During laparoscopy, your doctor will destroy small areas of extra endometrial tissue that are implanted outside the uterus. He may burn them away or use a laser to vaporize them. Your doctor also may trim away tissue that is displacing your pelvic organs. These procedures often can be done during a diagnostic laparoscopy session.\n\nFor more extensive endometriosis, you may need traditional abdominal surgery. This is done through a larger incision. The larger incision provides more room to reach and treat all areas of endometriosis inside your pelvis and abdomen.\n",
      "Hysterectomy": "The doctor may treat endometriosis by removing the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. Hysterectomy is a last resort when other measures have failed. It is only performed in women with severe disabling pain who no longer want to become pregnant.\nThe treatment option that is best for you depends on several factors. These include the severity of your symptoms and your plans for pregnancy.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor or gynecologist if you experience:\nAlso contact your doctor if you have been unable to conceive a child after one year of unprotected intercourse.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is good, especially when endometriosis is diagnosed and treated early. Medical and surgical treatments can relieve the pain of endometriosis in most women.\nEven without treatment, the majority of women with mild endometriosis eventually can become pregnant. Many women who have laparoscopic surgery to improve their fertility become pregnant.\nSymptoms of endometriosis go away after menopause, as long as estrogen treatment is not used.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Endophthalmitis is an inflammation of the inside of the eye. Inflammation affects the vitreous fluid in center of the eye. Vitreous fluid is a clear, gel-like substance. The inflammation can extend to surrounding tissues responsible for vision. Endophthalmitis is rare.\nIn most cases, an infection triggers this inflammation. The infection can be caused by:\nIn the United States, most cases result from bacterial infections that follow eye surgery. For example, the condition may follow a procedure to treat cataracts or glaucoma. Bacteria also can enter the eye through an injury that pierces the eye.\nLess often, an infection from elsewhere in the body can travel to the eye through the blood.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The most common symptoms are loss of vision and pain. Additional symptoms vary. They depend on what caused the eye infection:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Endophthalmitis can lead to serious vision problems. A medical doctor who specializes in eye problems (an ophthalmologist) must diagnose and treat it.\nThe doctor will review your symptoms. He or she will ask about your medical history, especially any eye surgery or eye trauma.\nThe doctor will examine your eyes. He or she will test how well you see in both eyes. The doctor will use an ophthalmoscope. This is a lighted instrument for looking inside the eye. An ultrasound of the eye may be ordered. Ultrasound can detect abnormal debris in the center of the eye.\nThe ophthalmologist may recommend a procedure called a vitreous tap. The doctor anesthetizes the eye. He or she then uses a tiny needle to withdraw some of the eye's internal fluid. This fluid is tested for bacteria or other organisms.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "For the best chance to preserve and restore your vision, the condition must be treated promptly. Once treatment begins, symptoms may begin to improve within a day or two. In many cases, eye pain and eyelid swelling lessen before vision gets better.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you have had cataract surgery, you can help to decrease your risk of infection. To do so, follow your doctor's instructions for eye care after your surgery. Also, see your doctor regularly for follow-up eye exams.\nTo prevent endophthalmitis caused by eye trauma, use protective eyewear at work and during contact sports. Goggles, eye shields and helmets can help protect against industrial debris that can pierce or cut the eyes.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on:\nWhen the condition is caused by a bacterial infection, options include one or more of the following:\nWhen the condition is caused by a fungal infection, doctors usually inject an antifungal medication directly into the infected eye. The medication may also be given intravenously. Or, the person may receive an oral antifungal drug.\nThe ophthalmologist will monitor your progress. You will have frequent eye exams to monitor whether the treatment is improving your vision or not.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. It can cause permanent loss of vision if not diagnosed and treated promptly.\nCall your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms of this condition. This is particularly important if you have a history of:\n",

      "What is it?": "The prostate is a small gland approximately the size and shape of a walnut. It sits directly below the bladder, in front of the rectum. The prostate is a part of the male reproductive tract. It produces fluid that combines with sperm to make semen.\nAt birth, the prostate gland is tiny. When testosterone levels rise during puberty, the prostate grows rapidly, doubling in size by age 20. Growth slows down for the next two decades and the prostate usually does not cause problems for many years. Less than 10% of 30-year-old men have an enlarged prostate. When a man reaches his 40s, the prostate goes through a second growth spurt. Half of all men have an enlarged prostate by the time they reach age 60, and by age 85, 90% of men have an enlarged prostate.\nThe prostate surrounds the tube that carries urine from the bladder (urethra). During puberty, the prostate expands evenly. The enlargement that occurs in the second half of life, however, is concentrated in the part of the gland next to the urethra. As the gland gets bigger, it interferes with the flow of urine out of the bladder. That makes the bladder work harder to empty urine. Over time, the problem worsens, and eventually not all the urine can be emptied. The bladder wall also may become thickened, which can result in muscle spasms.\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "An enlarged prostate can make it more difficult to urinate. Not all men who have an enlarged prostate experience symptoms. However, about one-fourth of all men in the United States report some trouble urinating.\nAt first, symptoms may be mild because the bladder muscle is able to compensate for the pressure from the enlarged prostate on the urethra.\nThe pressure of the prostate on the urethra causes an interrupted or weak stream of urine. Other symptoms include:\nThe severity of these problems depends on how much pressure the prostate is putting on the urethra.\nAnother set of symptoms happens when the urine that collects in the bladder causes irritation. These symptoms include:\nPotentially serious complications can occur if the bladder does not empty completely. Urine that does not exit the bladder can lead to the growth of bacteria, which can cause frequent urinary tract infections. Also, urinary stones can form in the bladder lining due to an accumulation of debris and chemicals. Broken blood vessels can cause blood in the urine, often because of torn or enlarged veins on the inner surface of the prostate. Blood in the urine also can be caused by the sudden stretching of the bladder wall. If left untreated, urine retained in the bladder can back up into the kidneys, which can cause kidney failure over time.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask questions to rate the severity of your urinary symptoms. The doctor will do a digital rectal exam to feel the size, shape and consistency of the prostate gland. Usually, a sample of your urine will be examined for blood or evidence of infection.\nOccasionally, your doctor may order tests, such as an ultrasound, to measure the amount of urine in your bladder, or a cytoscopy, in which a lighted tube is inserted through the penis into the bladder. Special tests also can be done to evaluate the muscles and nerves in the bladder, especially if you are having trouble with leakage of urine.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Symptoms from an enlarged prostate are not always related directly to the size of the gland. Many men with an enlarged prostate don't have any symptoms. In other men, the symptoms are mild and worsen slowly enough that they never develop serious problems. About one-third of men with enlarged prostates have symptoms that continue to worsen and require treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "Although you cannot prevent the prostate from enlarging, you can take measures to reduce your symptoms:\n",
      "Treatment": "When to seek treatment and what action to take are personal decisions you should make with your doctor's input. The main reason to start treatment is that you are bothered by symptoms, or that changes in your urination are interfering with your lifestyle. It is rare for men with little or no symptoms to need treatment of any kind.\nHere are three treatment approaches:\nWatchful waitingIf your symptoms are not severe, see your doctor only as needed.\nMedicationsDrugs called alpha-blockers help to relax the muscles at the base of the bladder and increase a man's ability to urinate. Approximately 70% of men see improvement in their symptoms within a few days to a few weeks after beginning one of these medications. On the down side, alpha-blockers can cause dizziness, fatigue and excessively low blood pressure. Commonly prescribed alpha-blockers include tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (UroXatral), doxazosin (Cardura) and terazosin (Hytrin).\nFor some men, drugs that block testosterone can shrink the size of the prostate and increase the flow of urine. The drawbacks to this type of drug are that it can take three to six months to begin working, and that it can cause impotence in approximately 4% of men who take it. Commonly prescribed testosterone blockers, also known as 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, include finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart).\nRecent studies suggest that combining an alpha-blocker with a testosterone blocker may work better than either drug alone.\nSurgeryThis option offers the best chance for improving symptoms but also carries the greatest risk of complications. There are several types of surgical procedures, such as:\n\n\nWhile surgery usually is done as an elective procedure, some men need to have surgery if their bladder becomes blocked completely.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have bothersome symptoms or if you notice blood in your urine. If your urine flow stops completely, seek immediate care. You also should seek medical care if you experience symptoms of a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Medical and surgical treatments both are likely to relieve symptoms. Surgery is slightly more successful in relieving symptoms, but the risk of complications is greater.\n",

      "What Is It?": "The lining around your lungs is called the pleura. Pleurodynia is a general term for pain from this lining — pain in the chest or upper abdomen when you breathe.\nEpidemic pleurodynia is an infection caused by one of several viruses. This type of infection can cause a similar type of pain as the pain that comes from the lining around the lungs. However, in epidemic pleurodynia, the pain comes from the muscles in the chest that join ribs together.\nEpidemic pleurodynia also is called Bornholm disease, Sylvest's disease, devil's grip and epidemic benign dry pleurisy. It usually is caused by one of the group B coxsackieviruses and is less often caused by a group A coxsackievirus or an echovirus.\nGroup B coxsackieviruses are transmitted from person to person by fecal-oral contamination or direct mouth to mouth contact. Other people become infected with the virus if they touch contaminated items then put their fingers in their mouths before washing them properly. Contaminated items can include soiled diapers, shared toys and toilets.\nEpidemic pleurodynia is contagious and occurs in clusters, meaning many people in an area get it around the same time. Up to 90% of epidemics occur in the summer and early fall. The illness most commonly strikes people younger than age 30, although older people also may be affected.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Once inside the body, the coxsackieviruses multiply in the throat and intestines then spread into the bloodstream. At this point, the body's immune defenses often can limit the infection and prevent the person from developing symptoms. If the immune defenses are less successful, the person develops a fever or other symptoms, such as headache, nausea and vomiting, and sore throat. Only a few infected people develop the classic muscle pain in the chest and upper abdomen that gives the disease its name. In these people, the coxsackievirus infection has settled in the muscles of the chest and upper abdomen, causing inflammation there.\nThe chest pain usually feels worse with deep breathing, called pleuritic pain. It can be a severe, stabbing pain or it can be a milder cramping in the side. Usually, only one side of the chest or abdomen is affected, although occasionally the pain can include muscles of the neck or arms.\nThe pain usually comes in waves that last 15 to 30 minutes, although some people report having pain episodes that last for several hours. The pain can be so severe that you have trouble breathing, sweat a lot and become anxious.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and will examine you. Your doctor may press on muscles in your chest to see if the pressure triggers a spasm of pain. Often, your doctor can diagnose the problem without any special tests, especially if there is an outbreak of the illness in your area.\nIf your doctor is not sure of the diagnosis, you may need additional tests. These may include blood tests, X-rays of the chest or abdomen, an electrocardiogram (EKG) and a laboratory examination of body fluids or feces.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Symptoms of pleurodynia usually last about one to two days in children and about two to six days in adults. In some people, the pain and fever can return after they have been gone for a day or two. Very rarely, a person will have the pain and fever come and go over a period of three weeks or longer.\n",
      "Prevention": "The viruses that cause epidemic pleurodynia can spread very easily among young children, who tend to put toys or fingers into their mouth. The disease is most likely to spread in day care centers. The best way to prevent infection is to wash hands thoroughly, especially before meals or after changing a diaper or using the bathroom. There is no vaccine to prevent pleurodynia.\n",
      "Treatment": "In healthy people, pleurodynia is a harmless infection that goes away on its own within a few days. To treat the muscle pain, your doctor probably will recommend over-the-counter pain relievers.\nAspirin should not be given to children with pleurodynia because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious reaction causing brain and liver injury in children who take aspirin during certain viral illnesses.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you or someone in your family develops severe chest pain.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Almost all generally healthy individuals recover completely from pleurodynia. Uncommon complications of the coxsackievirus infection include viral meningitis, inflammation of the testis (orchitis) in men, hepatitis, pericarditis and myocarditis.\n",

      "What is it?": "An epidermoid, or epidermal, cyst is a small, movable lump under the skin. It forms when surface skin cells move deeper into the skin and multiply. These cells form the wall of the cyst and secrete a soft, yellowish substance called keratin, which fills the cyst. If the wall of the cyst is ruptured, the keratin is discharged into the surrounding skin, which causes irritation and inflammation.\nThe cyst may remain small for years, or it may continue to get larger. These cysts are rare in children but common in adults. Cysts are not cancerous.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A cyst is a movable, dome-shaped, smooth-surfaced mass that varies in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters (from less than a quarter of an inch to more than 2 inches). Epidermoid cysts can occur on almost any skin surface.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor can examine the swelling and tell you if you have a cyst.\n",
      "Expected duration": "A cyst may disappear on its own or remain indefinitely.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent epidermoid cysts.\n",
      "Treatment": "An epidermoid cyst usually does not need to be treated unless it is inflamed (red and tender) or is causing a cosmetic problem. Inflamed cysts usually are treated by draining the fluid and removing the shell that makes up the cyst wall. You also may be treated with antibiotics if the cyst and skin around the cyst appear to be infected. If a cyst is causing irritation or cosmetic difficulty, your physician can remove it by making a small incision in the skin and emptying the contents of the cyst and its wall.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have a new swelling on your skin that lasts for more than two weeks, contact your doctor. If it is painful or rapidly enlarging, you should arrange for sooner medical evaluation.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for epidermoid cysts is excellent. Many cysts have no symptoms and some will go away on their own. Cysts can return. If your cyst is problematic, your doctor may decide to drain it or remove it surgically. This does not usually lead to any complications or side effects.\n",

      "What is it?": "Epididymitis is an inflammation of the epididymis. The epididymis is the coiled tube at the back of the testicle. In most cases, an infection causes this inflammation.\nOrchitis is an infection of the testicle. It is much less common than epididymitis. Orchitis usually spreads to the testicle through the bloodstream. Viruses commonly cause the infection.\nEpididymo-orchitis is an inflammation of both the epididymis and the testicle.\n\nInfections that cause epididymitis usually are related to age, medical history and sexual activity.\nBefore puberty.Intestinal bacteria, such as E. coli, most often cause epididymitis. The bacteria travel from the bladder or some other site in the urinary tract.\nIn many cases, a birth-related abnormality affects the urinary tract's structure or function. These abnormalities increase the boy's risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The UTIs may eventually spread to the epididymis.\nFor example, a boy may be born with a structural abnormality of the tube that carries urine through the penis.\nIn sexually active men.The most common cause of epididymitis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD). The STD is usually chlamydia, gonorrhea or both.\nThe initial site of infection is the urethra. This is the tube-like passageway that carries urine and semen out of the penis. Eventually, bacteria spread backward through the reproductive tract to attack the epididymis.\nThis condition may appear several months after the sexual encounter that caused the STD. In some cases, the man first has symptoms of an infected urethra. In other cases, symptoms of epididymitis are the first and only signs of an STD.\nAmong men who have anal intercourse, epididymitis can be caused by intestinal bacteria from the anus. These bacteria enter the urethra through the penis. They then travel backward through the reproductive tract.\nIn adults with a high-risk medical history.Some men have a history of UTIs or prostate infections. For them, epididymitis usually is caused by intestinal bacteria that have spread from the infected site.\nAfter surgery, testing or catheterization.Epididymitis may develop after surgery or a diagnostic test that involves the bladder or urethra. Or it may occur after a catheter has been inserted to collect urine.\nIn these cases, the infection usually is caused by intestinal bacteria. These bacteria enter the urethra or bladder, either during the procedure or through the catheter.\nOther forms (all age groups).Rarely, epididymitis can occur when a systemic (whole body) infection spreads through the bloodstream and moves to the epididymis.\nNoninfectious epididymitis.A noninfectious form of this condition can occur. Often the exact cause remains unknown. It sometimes develops in men who take amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone). This is a heart medication that seems to build up in the epididymis.\nSome cases have been blamed on intense exercise, especially heavy lifting. The strain of heavy lifting may force urine from the bladder into the epididymis. There, it can cause a form of chemical irritation that triggers epididymitis.\nMany cases of this condition can be treated at home. But some are so severe that hospitalization is necessary.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of epididymitis and orchitis can include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "You will describe your symptoms. Your doctor will ask questions about your medical history, surgical history and sexual activity. He or she then will examine you, including your genital area.\nYou may need one or more of the following tests:\nSymptoms may be so severe that the doctor must test to see if you have testicular torsion. This is a sudden, painful twisting of the testicle that cuts off the testicle's blood supply.\nYou may need an ultrasound if there is a concern for testicular torsion. This is a painless test that uses sound waves. In this case, it measures blood flow in the testicles.\nRadionuclide scanning is another test you may need. In this test, a small amount of a radioactive isotope is injected into your blood. If the isotope collects near the testicle, it may indicate testicular torsion.\n",
      "Expected duration": "In most cases of mild bacterial epididymitis, pain decreases within one to three days after you start taking antibiotics. However, swelling in the scrotum and testicle may last for several weeks.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can reduce your risk of developing epididymitis caused by STDs. Practice safe sex. Have sex with only one, uninfected partner. Use latex or polyurethane condoms during every sexual activity. This includes oral and anal sex.\n",
      "Treatment": "Antibiotics are used to treat epididymitis caused by:\nA young boy with epididymitis probably will be referred to a urologist. This doctor specializes in illnesses of the urinary tract and male reproductive organs. The urologist will check for urinary tract problems.\nFor both epididymitis and orchitis, the following measures can help relieve the discomfort and may lead to quicker recovery:\nPeople with severe pain in the scrotum may need a prescription pain medication.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "A doctor must evaluate severe pain in the scrotum or testicles. This can be a symptom of testicular torsion, as well as epididymitis.\nCall your doctor immediately if you develop pain, tenderness or swelling in your scrotum. Call especially if these symptoms develop rapidly over a few hours.\nAlso, contact your doctor if you notice an abnormal discharge from your penis or burning when you urinate.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With treatment, most cases of mild epididymitis and orchitis can be cured. There is usually no long-term effect on fertility, especially when only one side of the scrotum is involved.\n",

      "What Is It?": "The epiglottis is the flap of tissue located just above the windpipe (trachea) that directs the flow of air and food in the throat. When we breathe, the epiglottis moves to allow air into the lungs. When we eat, the epiglottis covers the top of the windpipe, so that food goes into the swallowing tube (esophagus), and not into the lungs.\nEpiglottitis can occur at any age. Until 1985, epiglottitis occurred most commonly in children aged 3 to 7, but with the development of a vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), epiglottitis is now increasingly rare in vaccinated children.Epiglottitis is a rare, but potentially life-threatening infection. It causes sudden swelling of the epiglottis, which often worsens rapidly, sometimes within hours. Without timely treatment, the epiglottis can become so large that it blocks the windpipe, making it hard to breathe. This can cause death.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The most common signs and symptoms of epiglottitis include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Epiglottitis is an emergency. If you think your child has this infection, seek emergency help immediately. Never try to look down the throat of a person who is suspected of having epiglottitis.Pressing on the tongue to look down the throat may cause the epiglottis to swell even more and further block the airway.\nX-rays of the neck sometimes can show an enlarged epiglottis, but the time needed to take the X-rays may delay other important tests and treatment.\nAfter doctors in the hospital confirm that the epiglottis is inflamed, the airway is kept open using a breathing tube. Blood tests and/or throat swabs are done to determine which organism is causing the infection.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Most people begin to recover within 24 to 48 hours after receiving antibiotics. Breathing tubes usually can be removed soon after that. It may take up to a week or more to recover completely.\n",
      "Prevention": "Most cases of epiglottitis in children can be prevented by having children vaccinated against Hib and pneumococcal infections.\n",
      "Treatment": "Epiglottitis needs to be treated in the hospital so the person's breathing can be monitored. If the person is having trouble breathing, he or she may need to have a breathing tube inserted in his or her throat.\nAntibiotics should be started immediately after breathing is stabilized and blood samples and throat swabs are taken. Antibiotics usually are given through an intravenous line (into a vein). Once the infection is under control, antibiotics can be taken by mouth until treatment is complete. Additional medicines may be given to control fever and pain.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call an ambulance at the first sign of unexplained breathing difficulty, especially if accompanied by a sore throat, fever, drooling or noisy breathing.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With proper treatment, people usually recover completely. The key, however, is recognizing the symptoms early, so that treatment can be started before difficulties begin.\n",

      "What is epilepsy?": "Epilepsy is a brain condition that causes repeated episodes of sudden, brief changes in the brain's electrical activity. These changes cause various types of symptoms.\nEpileptic episodes are called seizures or convulsions. During a seizure, brain cells fire uncontrollably at up to four times their normal rate. Seizures temporarily affect the way a person behaves, moves, thinks or feels.\nThere are two main types of seizures:\nMany conditions can affect the brain and trigger epilepsy. These include:\nIn most people with epilepsy, the specific cause is unknown.\n",
      "Symptoms of epilepsy": "The symptoms of epilepsy vary. They depend on how much of the brain is affected, and where the affected area is located.\n",
      "Primary generalized seizures": "The seizure episode may last for a few minutes, during which a person is unconscious. When someone wakes up from a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, they are lethargic and confused. This usually lasts minutes, but it can last hours. There may be muscle soreness and a headache.\nThis type of seizure usually begins in childhood or early adolescence.\n",
      "Simple partial seizure": "The person remains awake and aware. Symptoms vary depending on the brain area involved. They can include:\nAfter the seizure, the person has no memory of the episode.\n",
      "Status epilepticus": "Occurs when a person has a generalized seizure that lasts long enough to raise the risk of death, or recurs without full return to consciousness.  Status epilepticus used to be defined by a generalized seizure that lasted 30 minutes or more. Today, it is defined by one of two features:\nStatus epilepticus is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention.\n",
      "Diagnosing epilepsy": "You may not have any seizure symptoms when you visit your doctor's office. For this reason, it is important to enlist the help of anyone who has witnessed your seizure. Ask that person to describe exactly what they saw: what happened at the start, what happened next. Write this description down for your doctor. This description will help your doctor determine the type of seizure you had. It will also help to decide on appropriate treatment.\nHaving a seizure does not mean that a person has epilepsy. For example, it's common for children to have seizures associated with fever. Most children who have them do not develop epilepsy.\nYour doctor will diagnose epilepsy based on:\nIn many cases, your doctor will also order a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. Other types of brain scans also may be needed.\nYour doctor may want to check whether your seizures are related to causes outside the brain. To do so, he or she may order basic lab tests. These can include blood tests, urinalysis and an electrocardiogram (EKG).\n",
      "Expected duration of epilepsy": "Epilepsy can be a lifelong condition. But many people with a history of multiple seizures eventually will stop having seizures.\nPeople who are younger when seizures start are more likely to stop having seizures. The same is true for people who have a normal neurological examination.\nFor most people with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with medication.\n",
      "Preventing epilepsy": "The cause of most cases of epilepsy remains unknown. Therefore, there is no way to prevent the condition.\nHowever, there is very effective treatment for people with epilepsy that can reduce the number and severity of seizures. For many, control of epilepsy can prevent almost all seizures from occurring.\nTo help prevent epilepsy caused by head injury, you can:\nAnyone with an active seizure disorder should take precautions. These will minimize the risk of injury if a seizure should occur. For this reason, people with epilepsy are advised not to operate a motor vehicle for at least six months after the most recent seizure. The same applies to operating other dangerous machinery.\nPeople with epilepsy should consider wearing some sort of medical identification that describes their condition. This will provide important information to emergency medical personnel.\n",
      "Treating epilepsy": "In most cases, treatment begins with one of the many anti-epileptic medications. The type of medication used depends on the type of seizure being treated.\nWhen medication fails to control a person's seizures, surgery may be considered. If the abnormal electrical activity that triggers each seizure is coming from one particular part of the brain, cutting out that part of the brain can stop the repeated seizures. Of course this kind of brain surgery can cause some permanent problems with brain function, depending on where in the brain the focus of the seizures is. For this reason, the risks of surgery have to be balanced against the benefits. The decision to perform surgery depends on many factors. These include:\nStatus epilepticus is a life-threatening medical emergency. It is treated with medications given intravenously or rectally. Protective measures are also taken. These measures keep the person's airway open. And they help to prevent injury to the person's head and tongue.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you or anyone in your family experiences new symptoms suggestive of a seizure.\nCall for emergency help immediately if you suspect that someone with epilepsy has developed status epilepticus.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people with epilepsy can control their seizures with medication.\nSome people have epilepsy that cannot be controlled with anti-epileptic drugs. Many of these cases can be treated with surgery.\n",

      "What is esophageal cancer?": "Esophageal cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food and liquid to your stomach.\nThere are two types of esophageal cancer:\n",
      "Risk factors": "No one knows for sure what causes esophageal cancer. However, the most significant risk factors include the following:\nOther risk factors include the following:\n",
      "Symptoms of esophageal cancer": "At first, esophageal cancer may not cause any symptoms. But as it progresses, it may cause:\nOther conditions can cause these symptoms. But if you have any of them, see your doctor.\n",
      "Diagnosing esophageal cancer": "Your doctor will examine you and review your medical history. He or she probably will order chest x-rays and other diagnostic tests, too. These may include the following:\nPeople with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma have a higher risk of mouth, throat, lung, and stomach cancer. That's why you may also have tests with endoscopes inside the throat and lungs, as well as chest x-rays and CT scans.\n",
      "Expected duration of esophageal cancer": "Esophageal cancer will continue to grow until it is treated. It can spread to almost any part of the body. The chance of survival increases greatly if the disease is detected early.\n",
      "Preventing esophageal cancer": "While some risk factors for esophageal cancer can't be avoided, you can lower your risk of the disease:\n",
      "Treating esophageal cancer": "After the cancer has been diagnosed, your doctor will determine how far it has advanced and assign it a stage. The stages run from 0 to IV; the higher the stage, the further the cancer has spread. For example, in stage 0, the cancer is confined to the lining of the esophagus. In stage I, the cancer has not invaded the outer muscle layer of the esophagus.\nTreatment for esophageal cancer depends on the size and location of the tumor, its stage, your symptoms, and your general health. Many different treatments and combinations of treatments may be used. The most common ones are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.\nSurgically removing the tumor and surrounding tissue offers the best chance of a cure. Usually, the surgeon opens the chest or abdomen. He or she then removes, through one or two incisions, all or part of the esophagus and the nearby lymph nodes. This helps keep the cancer from spreading.\nSometimes, the upper part of the stomach is removed, too. The surgeon then uses the rest of the stomach or part of the intestine to reconnect the digestive tract, so that you can swallow. This is very intensive surgery; some patients can't tolerate it.\nThe surgeon may be able to modify the procedure and use minimally invasive techniques in certain patients, such as those with other serious medical conditions. Instead of one or two larger incisions, the surgeon may make several smaller ones. This may decrease the risk of some complications. But a surgeon doing this procedure must be highly skilled.\nBecause esophageal surgery is so extensive, the least invasive approach to reduce the size of incisions is most desirable. The recovery times for this type of surgery are much better than more traditional surgical approaches.\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. The radiation may come from a machine outside the body (external radiation) or from radioactive material placed in or near the tumor (internal radiation).\nYour doctor may suggest radiation therapy\nChemotherapy involves the use of anticancer drugs to kill cancer cells. The drugs are usually injected into a vein. Chemotherapy may be combined with radiation therapy.\nBefore recommending a treatment, your doctors will weigh the benefits of surgery against its risks. (It can cause numerous complications.) For many people, radiation therapy alone or combined with chemotherapy may offer the same chance of survival as surgery.\nSome types of esophageal cancer cells contain specific mutations (changes in the DNA) that may respond to drugs that attack these mutations. This type of cancer treatment is often referred to as targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is especially relevant for cancers that occur in the lowest portion of the esophagus (just above the stomach).\nImmunotherapy that helps the immune system better attack esophageal cancer cells may be considered for advanced stages not responsive to other therapies.\nYour doctor may recommend other treatments to ease symptoms. For example, he or she may put a stent (a small, wire-mesh tube) in your esophagus so the cancer doesn't block it. This is generally done when the patient is spitting up food or the food is unable to go through the esophagus to get to the stomach.\nThis will allow you to eat normally. A laser can prevent blockages and improve swallowing by reducing the size of a tumor.\nIf swallowing is so difficult that adequate nutrition cannot be taken by mouth, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube inserted into the stomach or intestine.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms:\nMost often these symptoms will not be caused by esophageal cancer, but they always require medical attention.\nIf you have been diagnosed with GERD, consult a gastroenterologist. He or she can determine whether you have any precancerous conditions in the lower esophagus — and treat them. More and more specialists ablate Barrett's esophagus with an endoscope before it becomes cancerous.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The earlier the cancer is detected, the higher the survival rate. Over 80% of patients diagnosed with stage 0 and stage 1 esophageal cancer live at least five years. But many cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed at more advanced stages.\nWith or without surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy can help improve quality of life. They can also prolong survival, even when the disease is advanced.\n",

      "What is it?": "Esophageal rings and webs are folds that block your esophagus either partially or completely. Rings are bands of normal esophageal tissue that form constrictions around the inside of the esophagus. They occur in the lower esophagus. Webs, which arise in the upper esophagus, are thin layers of cells that grow across the inside of the esophagus. Either condition may make it difficult to swallow solid food.\nExperts aren't sure what causes esophageal rings and webs. The condition may be congenital (inherited) or may develop after birth. People with esophageal rings and webs commonly have reflux symptoms. When esophageal webs occur together with iron-deficiency anemia, the condition is known as Plummer-Vinson syndrome.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most esophageal rings and webs do not cause any symptoms, and are discovered when people have barium x-rays or endoscopy for unrelated reasons. When rings or webs do cause symptoms, the most common complaint is difficulty swallowing solids. Foods, especially meats and breads, may feel like they get stuck in the same place.\nFood occasionally can become lodged in the esophagus and require an endoscopic procedure to unblock the esophagus.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "To determine if you have a ring or a web, your doctor may order one of these tests:\nWebs are thin and pliable and may be difficult to detect. Your doctor may miss them with either test. One advantage of endoscopy is that your doctor may be able to widen an area of narrowing during the process, opening up the esophagus.\n",
      "Expected duration": "There is no way to prevent esophageal rings or webs. However, because this condition may be related to acid reflux or iron-deficiency anemia, you can take measures to prevent and treat these disorders. Avoid foods that promote acid reflux, especially coffee, chocolate, fatty foods, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, peppermint, spearmint, citrus fruits, tomatoes, whole milk, and onions. The treatment of iron-deficiency anemia varies depending on the cause of the problem.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent esophageal rings or webs. However, because this condition may be related to acid reflux or iron-deficiency anemia, you can take measures to prevent and treat these disorders. Avoid foods that promote acid reflux, especially coffee, chocolate, fatty foods, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, peppermint, spearmint, citrus fruits, tomatoes, whole milk, and onions. The treatment of iron-deficiency anemia varies depending on the cause of the problem.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have acid reflux and rings or webs, treatment will be directed at improving the reflux. Because iron deficiency may contribute to the development of esophageal rings and webs, your doctor probably will order a blood test for iron levels and, if you are deficient, prescribe iron supplements.\nIf swallowing difficulties continue, you will be referred to a specialist who performs endoscopy and esophageal dilation. Dilation involves stretching and widening the narrowed part of the esophagus. The doctor first will locate the web or ring with the endoscope, then will insert a specially designed balloon through the scope to the narrowed area. The balloon will be inflated to stretch the rings and break up the webs.\nA few people have rings in the lower esophagus that don't improve even after repeated dilation therapy. In this case, your doctor may suggest using electrocautery to reduce the size of the ring. This can be done through an endoscope using a special wire that can deliver an electric current directly to the extra tissue.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should contact your doctor if you have any difficulty swallowing. You should seek emergency medical attention if you can't swallow liquids because food has lodged in your esophagus.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for esophageal webs and rings is excellent. Even people with difficulty swallowing do well after dilation. If symptoms keep returning, you may need repeat dilations or electrocautery to control the symptoms.\n",

      "What is it?": "Esophageal varices are swollen veins in the lining of the lower esophagus near the stomach. Gastric varices are swollen veins in the lining of the stomach. Swollen veins in the esophagus or stomach resemble the varicose veins that some people have in their legs. Because the veins in the esophagus are so close to the surface of the esophagus, swollen veins in this location can rupture and cause dangerous bleeding.\nEsophageal varices almost always occur in people who have cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis causes scarring of the liver, which slows the flow of blood through the liver. Scarring causes blood to back up in the portal vein, the main vein that delivers blood from the stomach and intestines to the liver. This backup causes high blood pressure in the portal vein and other nearby veins. This is called portal hypertension.\nLess common causes of portal hypertension and esophageal varices include blood clots in the veins leading to and from the liver, and schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that can clog up the liver, causing pressure to back up in the portal vein.\nThe backup of blood forces veins to enlarge in the vicinity of the stomach and esophagus. The veins don't enlarge in a uniform fashion. Esophageal varices usually have enlarged, irregularly shaped bulbous regions (varicosities) that are interrupted by narrower regions. These abnormal dilated veins rupture easily and can bleed profusely because:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Portal hypertension often does not cause any symptoms. Sometimes it is first discovered when the varices bleed. When significant bleeding occurs, a person will vomit blood, often in large amounts. People with massive bleeding feel dizzy and may lose consciousness.\nSome people bleed in smaller amounts over a longer period, and they swallow the blood rather than vomit. Their stools may contain red or tarry-black blood.\nPeople with esophageal varices caused by cirrhosis will usually have other symptoms related to their liver disease.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "To diagnose esophageal varices, a doctor will use an instrument called an endoscope. It is a thin, flexible tube with a camera at its tip. The doctor inserts the endoscope into the mouth. The scope is gently advanced into the esophagus to search for esophageal varices. If the varices are actively bleeding or have recently bled, this procedure will be done as an emergency. Tiny instruments may be attached to the endoscope to provide treatment at the same time.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Bleeding from esophageal varices usually does not stop without treatment. Bleeding esophageal varices is a life-threatening emergency. About 50% of people who have bleeding from esophageal varices will have the problem return during the first one to two years. The risk of recurrence can be reduced with treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "The best way to prevent esophageal varices is to reduce your risk of cirrhosis. The main causes of cirrhosis include overuse of alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and fatty liver.\nChildren, young teens, and all health care workers and older adults at risk of hepatitis B should be vaccinated against the disease. There is no vaccine to prevent people from contracting hepatitis C.\nIf you have esophageal varices, treatment may be able to prevent bleeding. This treatment includes endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy (described in the Treatment section) to shrink the varices. Drugs to reduce portal blood pressure — such as propranolol (Inderal) or nadolol (Corgard) — also can be used alone or in combination with endoscopic techniques.\n",
      "Treatment": "Emergency treatment for bleeding esophageal varices begins with blood and fluids given intravenously (into a vein) to compensate for blood loss. At the same time, intravenous drugs are usually given to decrease blood flow in the portal vein and help slow the rate of bleeding from the varices. Efforts are then made to stop the bleeding.\nEndoscopy is done to identify the site of the bleeding. If the bleeding is caused by ruptured esophageal varices, one of two endoscopic treatments are often used:\nBleeding esophageal varices can result in a very large amount of blood loss and many units of blood may need to be transfused. Once the bleeding is controlled, treatment is done to try to prevent more bleeding in the future. In some cases, more band ligation procedures are done to try to get rid of the varices. For people with severe cirrhosis, a procedure to minimize pressure in the veins is sometimes necessary. Pressure is reduced by creation of a shunt, which is a channel or pipeline that diverts blood away from the high-pressure veins. Options for creating a shunt include:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Bleeding from esophageal varices can be life-threatening. Patients can lose massive amounts of blood in a short time, causing extremely low blood pressure and shock. If you vomit blood or notice blood in your stool, you should always seek immediate medical attention.\n",
      "Prognosis": "At least 50% of people who survive bleeding esophageal varices are at risk of more bleeding during the next one to two years. The risk can be reduced by endoscopic and drug treatments.\nIf a TIPSS procedure or other shunt procedure is required, some blood will pass through the liver without being thoroughly detoxified by enzymes within the liver. Natural waste products in the blood can accumulate if the blood is not detoxified by the liver. Because of this some people who have had a TIPSS procedure develop symptoms of confusion, called encephalopathy. Medication can reduce symptoms of encephalopathy.\n",

      "What is it?": "The esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food through the chest, from the mouth to the stomach. Normally you don't feel it except when you are swallowing. However, if the inside lining of your esophagus becomes inflamed, you may experience pain or problems with swallowing. This inflammation of the esophagus is called esophagitis.\n\nEsophagitis has several common causes:\n\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a special subtype of this condition. The diagnosis is based on biopsy samples of the esophagus that show a predominance of eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cells that the body may produce in response to inflammation or an allergic reaction.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptoms of esophagitis are:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis often is made based on your symptoms.\nThe most accurate way to check for esophagitis is for a doctor to look directly at the inside of the esophagus with a video camera called an endoscope. The endoscope has a camera at the end of a flexible, plastic-coated cord. This tube is long enough to reach through the stomach to the first portion of the intestine (duodenum). The procedure is sometimes called esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD.\nUsing the endoscope, the doctor can see evidence of injury from esophagitis. The doctor will look for areas where the lining of the esophagus has worn away (called erosions or ulcers), blisters, or scarred areas. Some infections leave a deposit on the esophagus walls that can be sampled through the endoscope by using a remote-controlled brush. In some cases the doctor will biopsy the esophagus by snipping a small sample of the inside lining through the end of the endoscope. This tissue is examined under a microscope.\n\nSince esophagitis is only one of the things that can cause symptoms of chest pain or swallowing problems, your doctor may order other tests to evaluate your heart, lungs, or digestive tract.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long symptoms last depends on how easily their cause can be eliminated. Bad cases of reflux or resistant viruses, for example, might require several tries before the right medicine or treatment is found. In most cases, symptoms begin to improve within a few days of starting the right treatment. But it can take weeks for symptoms to go away completely. Esophagitis from an infection may be harder to cure if the immune system is severely weakened.\n",
      "Prevention": "The most common cause of esophagitis, acid reflux, sometimes can be prevented by some very simple measures:\nIf you have heartburn despite these measures, your doctor may suggest you take a preventive acid-blocking medicine.\nAll prescription and nonprescription pills should be taken while you are upright and should be swallowed with water. This is especially important for the medicines that frequently cause esophagitis.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cause of esophagitis.\nAcid-blocking medications, including H2-blockers and proton-pump inhibitors, are usually prescribed. For persistent esophagitis, your doctor may recommend surgery to tighten the lower esophageal sphincter.\nWhile your esophagus is recovering, your doctor can ease your pain symptoms by prescribing pain relievers.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you are unable to eat or drink due to pain during swallowing, you should contact your doctor. Life-threatening dehydration can develop quickly if you cannot drink liquids.\nOccasionally an injured esophagus can develop a hole, causing sudden worsening of chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever. Report these symptoms to your doctor immediately.\nIf your symptoms do not clear up with initial treatment, consult your doctor. Occasionally, scarring in the esophagus will cause persistent swallowing difficulty that might require dilation therapy done through the endoscope.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Almost all cases of esophagitis can be cured. Some causes, such as acid reflux, may require long-term treatment.\n",

      "What is essential tremor?": "Tremor is the shaky movements of your hands, limbs, head, or voice that you can't control. Sometimes tremor is a normal reaction to a situation such as fear, fatigue, or anger. It also can be a side effect of too much caffeine, a medication, or withdrawal from a drug or medicine. When tremor occurs during activities and there is no anatomic, emotional, or chemical cause, it can be a sign of a neurological disease called essential tremor.\nEssential tremor is different than Parkinson's disease, another neurological illness. Essential tremor is most noticeable when your body is in action, such as when you are writing, typing, or pouring a beverage. In contrast, the tremors of Parkinson's are more noticeable at rest.\nIn essential tremor, tremors begin when you use your hands. For example, when you are writing, typing, or pouring a beverage. Essential tremor often begins in the dominant hand.\nPeople sometimes worry that essential tremor is the start of Parkinson's disease. The two conditions are very different. The tremors of Parkinson's are more noticeable at rest. People with Parkinson's watch their hands shake when they rest in their lap. But when they reach out to grab or hold something, such as a cup of coffee, the shaking stops.\nAs many as one in four people develops essential tremor as they age. You are more likely to develop essential tremor if you have a parent or sibling with the condition.\nEssential tremor is much more common than Parkinson's disease.\n",
      "Symptoms of essential tremor": "The main symptom is shaking of one or both hands or the head. The shaking is uncontrollable, but it is not always dramatic. Sometimes, speech trembles.\nStress, caffeine, and certain medicines may make the tremor worse.\n",
      "Diagnosing essential tremor": "Your doctor will identify essential tremor by its pattern and your history.\nFeatures that make the diagnosis likely include:\nYour doctor will review your medications. He or she will identify any that can cause tremor as a side effect.\nYour doctor may want you to have additional tests. These tests can identify other medical conditions that can cause similar symptoms. If any of these conditions are causing your tremor, you do not have essential tremor.\nIf you have diabetes, tremor can be a symptom of low blood sugar levels. Tremor can also be caused by an excess of certain metals in your body. For example, excessive copper deposits and exposure to mercury or arsenic can cause tremor.\n",
      "Expected duration of essential tremor": "Essential tremor is a permanent condition. The degree of tremor typically worsens as you age. It also can expand from one part of your body to other parts over time.\n",
      "Preventing essential tremor": "No one knows what causes essential tremor. Therefore, there is no way to prevent it.\nStress, inadequate sleep, caffeine, and certain medicines may make the tremor worse. If stress makes your tremor worse, you can learn ways to reduce your stress.\nIf caffeine worsens your symptoms, try to cut down on caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and soft drinks.\nMedicines that can make the tremor more noticeable include:\nTalk to your doctor if any of these medications could be worsening your tremor.\n",
      "Treating essential tremor": "Many people with essential tremor do not require treatment. However, if the tremor causes significant distress or disability, medications called beta blockers are the most effective treatments. Examples include atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal).\nBeta blockers usually improve the tremor so that it does not interfere with normal activities. In some people, the tremor disappears completely. If you stop taking the medication, the tremor will return.\nOther drugs that may help include one or more of the following (which are sometimes used in combination):\nPhysical therapy and occupational therapy may help people with essential tremor find easier ways to function throughout the day.\nFor severe symptoms, your doctor may discuss injections of botulinum toxin (Botox) or very special surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation (implantation of electrodes into the brain). These are generally reserved for severe tremors that don't respond to other therapies.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if your tremor starts to interfere with your ability to do your normal, daily activities.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Treatment can minimize the symptoms. But essential tremor slowly worsens over time. Most people experience only mild or moderate symptoms. In other people, essential tremor can cause substantial disability.\n",

      "What is it?": "The eye socket is a bony cup that surrounds and protects the eye. The rim of the socket is made of fairly thick bones, while the floor and nasal side of the socket is paper thin in many places. A fracture is a broken bone in the eye socket involving the rim, the floor or both.\nAbout 85% of traumatic eye injuries, including eye socket fractures, happen by accident, during contact sports, at work, in car crashes, or while doing home repair projects. About 15% are caused by violent assaults. Men suffer from traumatic eye injuries about four times more often than women do. The average age of the injured person is about 30.\nThe source of the injury is usually a blunt object — baseball, hammer, rock, piece of lumber — and the most frequent place of injury is the home. At one time, eye injuries were common in motor vehicle accidents, usually when a victim's face struck the dashboard. Such eye injuries have decreased dramatically, because most cars have airbags and most states have laws mandating the use of seat belts.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary, depending on the location and severity of the fracture, but can include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If you are conscious and able to answer questions after your injury, your doctor will review your symptoms and ask how your eye injury occurred. He or she will examine your eye, and will gently touch and press on your cheek and forehead to check if these areas are distorted. The doctor also will check for:\nIn someone who is unconscious and has severe facial injuries, doctors can confirm the diagnosis of an eye socket fracture with x-rays and a CT scan of the eye socket bones. This is done after any life-threatening injuries have been addressed and the person's condition has stabilized.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long the injury lasts depends on the location and severity of the fracture. In most cases, swelling and discoloration begin to go away within seven to 10 days after the injury, but fractured bones take much longer to heal. If surgery is necessary to repair the injured area, your doctor may delay the procedure for several weeks to allow swelling to go away.\n",
      "Prevention": "Almost all eye injuries can be prevented. To decrease your risk of fracturing your eye socket:\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the severity and location of your injury. For a small, uncomplicated blowout fracture that does not affect the movement of your eye, your doctor may prescribe ice packs, decongestants, and an antibiotic to prevent infection. You may be told to rest for a few days and to avoid blowing your nose while the eye heals.\nIf the fracture is more severe, your doctor will refer you to a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who specializes in treating eye injuries. An ophthalmologist may be called in to deal with the double vision. This specialist will determine whether you need surgery to repair the broken bone. Surgery may be needed to:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you suffer a blow to your eye, apply cold packs to the injured area for at least 15 minutes to help reduce pain, swelling, and discoloration. Seek medical attention immediately if you experience any of symptoms of an eye socket fracture.\nContact your doctor if you see flashing lights or \"floaters\" (spots or shadowy shapes) in your injured eye, or if you have a cut on your eyelid or on the inside surface of your eye.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, the outlook is very good. Even when surgery is needed to repair the fracture, most procedures have a high rate of success and a low risk of long-term complications.\n",

      "What is it?": "A fallen arch or flatfoot is known medically as pes planus. The foot loses the gently curving arch on the inner side of the sole, just in front of the heel. If this arch is flattened only when standing and returns when the foot is lifted off the ground, the condition is called flexible pes planus or flexible flatfoot. If the arch disappears in both foot positions — standing and elevated — the condition is called rigid pes planus or rigid flatfoot.\n\n",
      "Flexible flatfoot": "When there are no symptoms, treatment is not needed.\nIf a child older than age 3 develops symptoms, the doctor may prescribe a therapeutic shoe insert made from a mold of the child's foot, or a corrective shoe. As an alternative, some doctors recommend store-bought arch supports. These appear to work as well as more expensive treatments in many children. With any conservative, nonsurgical treatment, the goal is to relieve pain by supporting the arch and correcting any imbalance in the mechanics of the foot.\nSurgery is typically offered as a last resort in people with significant pain that is resistant to other therapies.\n",
      "Rigid flatfoot": "The treatment of a rigid flatfoot depends on its cause:\nWhen flatfeet develop with no identifiable cause, treatment may not be necessary. If symptoms are bothersome, treatment options include shoe inserts (orthotics), braces, acetaminophen, or an NSAID such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Surgery may be recommended if function is impaired or if pain is severe despite more conservative treatments.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The majority of children and adults with flexible flatfeet never have symptoms. However, their toes may tend to point outward as they walk, a condition called out-toeing. A person who develops symptoms usually complains of tired, aching feet, especially after prolonged standing or walking.\nSymptoms of rigid flatfoot vary depending on the cause of the foot problem:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If your child has flatfeet, his or her doctor will ask about any family history of flatfeet or inherited foot problems. In a person of any age, the doctor will ask about occupational and recreational activities, previous foot trauma or foot surgery, and the type of shoes worn.\nThe doctor will examine your shoes to check for signs of excessive wear. Worn shoes often provide valuable clues to gait problems and poor bone alignment. The doctor will ask you to walk barefoot to evaluate the arches of the feet, to check for out-toeing and to look for other signs of poor foot mechanics.\nThe doctor will examine your feet for foot flexibility and range of motion and feel for any tenderness or bony abnormalities. Depending on the results of this physical examination, foot x-rays may be recommended.\nX-rays are always performed in a young child with rigid flatfeet and in an adult with acquired flatfeet due to trauma.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Although infants are usually born with flexible flatfeet, most develop normal arches sometime between ages 7 and 10. In the 15% to 20% of children whose flatfeet last into adulthood, the condition often is inherited and lifelong. However, it may not cause symptoms.\nA rigid flatfoot is a long-term condition, unless it is corrected with surgery or other therapy.\n",
      "Prevention": "In some cases, fallen arches may be avoided by preventing or treating its cause. For example:\nIn most cases, however, there is no known way to reliably prevent fallen arches.\n",
      "Treatment": "For mild pain or aching, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) may be effective.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor for persistent or unexplained foot pain, whether or not you have flatfeet. This is particularly important if your foot pain makes it difficult for you to walk.\nCall your pediatrician or family doctor if your child complains about foot pain or appears to be walking abnormally. Even if there are no foot symptoms, it is wise to check with your doctor periodically about your child's foot development, just to be sure that everything is progressing as expected.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Up to 20% of children with flexible flatfeet remain flatfooted as adults. However, most do not have any symptoms. If a child with flexible flatfeet begins to have foot pain, conservative treatment with shoe modifications can usually relieve the discomfort, although it may not correct the problem permanently.\nFor rigid flatfeet, the outlook depends on the cause of the problem:\n",

      "What is it?": "A person with farsightedness, also called hyperopia, has difficulty seeing objects close to the eye. They can see distant objects well.\nIn most cases, farsightedness is an inherited condition caused by an eye that is too short front to back. This reduces the distance between the cornea (the clear film that covers the front of the eye) and the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). Because this distance is shorter, images tend to focus behind the retina, rather than on the retina.\nUsually, the eye is able to compensate, partially or totally, for this focusing problem through a process called accommodation. This is especially true in younger people. In accommodation, tiny muscles within the eye contract, altering the shape of the lens and bringing the viewed object into focus.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of farsightedness can include:\nDuring childhood and adolescence, many people who have inherited short eyes do not show symptoms of farsightedness because their youthful eyes are so good at accommodating. With time, however, age-related changes in the lens can make the process of accommodation less effective, and symptoms of farsightedness eventually appear.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "After reviewing your symptoms, your doctor will examine your eyes, and will test how well you can see.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Farsightedness is usually a lifelong condition, although symptoms may not be noticeable during childhood.\n",
      "Prevention": "Most farsightedness is inherited and cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you are farsighted, your doctor probably will prescribe eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct your problem. The lenses used in both of these treatments are thick in the center and thinner around the edge, which brings the viewed image forward into proper focus on the retina.\nMany cases of farsightedness can be corrected with laser eye surgery, such as LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis). Although the FDA has approved several types of lasers for surgical treatment of farsightedness, not every farsighted person is a good candidate for this type of treatment.\nYou or your child needs an eye exam if your vision blurs when you try to read or if you find it difficult to see when you do close work, such as sewing, repairing delicate machinery, or building models. Contact your doctor's office.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you are a parent, call your pediatrician if your child holds books very close to his or her face while reading, complains of frequent headaches, or appears cross-eyed.\nInfants are normally very farsighted at birth, but this condition almost always corrects itself between ages 3 months and 2 years. However, make sure that your doctor checks your child's eyes as a part of every well-baby visit. Your child also should have visual testing at about age 3 and a half, and again at the start of school.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people find satisfaction with eyeglasses or contact lenses to adjust for farsightedness.\nMany people report satisfaction with the results of laser eye surgery, and tens of thousands of procedures are performed successfully each year in the United States. However, as in other forms of surgery, you should understand the risks and benefits of laser eye surgery before you decide whether to have the procedure done.\n",

      "What is it?": "Febrile seizures occur in children. They are caused by a high fever or by a sudden rise in body temperature.\nThe brain's nerve cells (neurons) communicate with each other by giving off tiny electric signals. When someone has a seizure (convulsion), the way the brain's nerve cells give off signals suddenly changes, which can trigger different muscles in the body to twitch or jerk uncontrollably.\nFebrile seizures usually happen at the beginning of an illness, soon after the fever first starts. Febrile seizures can affect up to 5% of children. They are most common between ages 6 months and 5 years.\nA child is more likely to have a febrile seizure when other family members have had febrile seizures. Children who have delays in normal development are also more likely to have seizures with fever.\nMore than one in three children who have had a febrile seizure will have another one within one year. The risk of having another seizure is greater in children who had their first seizure when they were younger than 12 months old.\nMost children eventually grow out of this condition.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Signs of a febrile seizure may include\n",
      "Diagnosis": "In most cases, a doctor can diagnose febrile seizures based on a description of the episode. However, the doctor may want to see your child to look for the cause of the fever. In particular, the doctor will want to make sure your child does not have any signs of a serious infection of the brain (encephalitis) or of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).\n",
      "Expected duration": "Febrile seizures usually last less than five minutes. If they last longer than this, call your doctor right away.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent the first febrile seizure. In children who already have had one febrile seizure, parents should be taught how to best manage a fever and a seizure if it occurs. Preventing high temperatures will decrease the risk of febrile seizures. Also parents should be reassured that febrile seizures are rarely harmful if they last only a few minutes.\nParents should never give children aspirin or a salicylate-containing product to reduce fever. Although rare, aspirin use is linked to Reye syndrome.\nSome medications may help to prevent more seizures. However, the potential side effects of these drugs may be worse than the benefits. Therefore, they are rarely prescribed.\n",
      "Treatment": "You cannot stop a seizure once it starts, but you can do the following to protect your child:\nAfter a seizure, call your doctor for advice.\nTreatment involves reducing the fever and treating whatever is causing the fever. Hospitalization usually is not necessary, unless the condition causing the fever requires it.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is excellent. Febrile seizures generally are not harmful and do not cause long-term problems. Children with cerebral palsy, developmental delays, or certain neurological problems are slightly more likely than other children to develop epilepsy (repeated seizures that are not related to fevers) after febrile seizures. Children who have repeated febrile seizures are at an increased risk of developing epilepsy. However, the risk is still very low.\n",

      "What is fecal incontinence?": "When stool (feces) leaks out from the rectum accidentally, it is known as fecal incontinence. Under normal circumstances, stool enters the end portion of the large intestine, called the rectum, where it is temporarily stored until a bowel movement occurs. As the rectum fills with stool, the anal sphincter muscle (a circular muscle surrounding the anal canal) prevents feces from coming out of the rectum until it is time to have a deliberate (controlled) bowel movement.\nVarious conditions can cause incontinence. The most common reason for incontinence is that the anal sphincter becomes too weak to hold the stool in the rectum. Alternatively, sometimes the rectum may start to lose its capacity to store the stool, or the person may be unable to feel that the rectum is full. Also, a person must be able to be aware of the need to empty the bowel, and be mobile enough to reach the bathroom in time. Diarrhea from any cause makes incontinence worse (since it is more difficult to control liquid stool than solid stool).\nThe anal sphincter may become weak either from direct damage to the muscle or from damage to the nerves that cause the muscle to contract normally.\n\nDamage to muscles can be caused by:\nDamage to nerves can be caused by:\nSometimes the sphincter muscle may be weak simply from aging, since all our body muscles tend to weaken as we grow older.\nConstipation that leads to fecal impaction in the rectum can lead to liquid stool leakage.\n",
      "Symptoms of fecal incontinence": "Symptoms of fecal incontinence can range from intermittent mild spotting of liquid stool, to the complete inability to contain solid stool.\n",
      "Diagnosing fecal incontinence": "Like any other anal or rectal condition, physicians evaluate incontinence initially by inspecting the anal area, feeling inside the anus with a gloved finger (digital rectal exam), and looking inside the anal canal with a small short scope (\"anoscope\"). If there has been damage to the sphincter muscle, there may be a visible defect or scarring in the anal canal.\nAlso, the digital rectal exam may reveal a weakness of the sphincter muscle. Nerve damage might be identified with the \"wink\" test, in which the doctor touches the anus to see if the sphincter contracts normally.\nThe next test is often a sigmoidoscopy. A doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (fitted with a light and video camera) into the rectum to look for inflammation, tumors or other problems. Your doctor may also suggest a barium enema x-ray or colonoscopy to look for problems in the colon further upstream.\nFurther diagnostic tests may include anal manometry, electromyography (\"EMG\"), and anal ultrasound. Anal manometry, measures the strength of the anal sphincter muscle. EMG measures the function of the nerves that go to the sphincter muscle. Anal ultrasound can give a picture of the structure of the muscle (to see if there are any tears or defects in muscle).\n",
      "Expected duration of fecal incontinence": "Fecal incontinence, when due to a temporary problem such as severe diarrhea or fecal impaction, disappears when that problem is treated. However, in some cases fecal incontinence can be severe and very difficult to control. This is more likely to occur in people who are elderly, frail or immobile.\n",
      "Preventing fecal incontinence": "Most often fecal incontinence cannot be prevented. However, taking steps to have regular bowel movements and avoiding constipation with fecal impaction can help.\n",
      "Treating fecal incontinence": "Treatment for fecal incontinence depends on the cause of the problem. If fecal incontinence is the result of diarrhea, fiber supplements that contain psyllium may help you to have firmer stools, which increase the sensation of rectal fullness. Anti-diarrhea medications such as \"Kaopectate,\" loperamide (\"Imodium\") or \"Lomotil\" are other options for treating diarrhea.\nIf the condition is the result of impaction, the hardened stool can be removed by hand or with enemas. Emptying the rectum completely each morning (sometimes with the aid of a glycerin suppository or an enema) may help, since there will be less stool to leak out during the day.\nPelvic muscle exercises (Kegel exercises) are sometimes useful. You need to practice contracting your sphincter at least three times a day. It is also crucial that you contract your anal muscles whenever you feel fullness in the rectum.\nSometimes an effective way to treat chronic fecal incontinence is with biofeedback. People can learn, with the help of a monitor and a nurse, to coordinate contraction of the sphincter muscle with the fullness that occurs when stool is in the rectum. Learning the technique requires patience and practice.\nWhen conservative treatments fail, the final option is surgery. Some people benefit from operations to surgically repair the anal sphincter muscle (\"sphincteroplasty\"). Sphincteroplasty is effective only if tests show that there has been major damage to the muscle from childbirth, trauma, or previous surgery (it is not effective if the sphincter muscle is weak just from nerve damage or aging).\nAnother option is to implant electrical stimulation electrodes over the tailbone to help contract the sphincter muscle (\"sacral nerve stimulation\"). Artificial anal sphincter devices are available, but they have substantial complication rates. All of these procedures have only moderate success rates, however.\nFinally, if all else fails, surgery to create a colostomy can improve the quality of life for some patients with severe incontinence.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Because of the embarrassment surrounding fecal incontinence, many people wait longer than necessary before seeking medical help. If the inability to control your bowel movements is an ongoing problem, consult your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although some types of fecal incontinence are harder to treat than others, most people with this problem can achieve some improvement. Between 70% and 80% of people with this problem get at least some relief with treatment.\n",

      "What is it?": "An infection inside the tip of the finger can form an enclosed pocket of pus (or abscess) that is very painful as it expands. A felon is a fingertip abscess deep in the palm side of the finger. It usually is caused by bacterial infection, most often from growth ofStaphylococcus aureusbacteria.\nA painful bump on the end of a finger that is sometimes mistaken for a felon is a herpes virus infection that forms a herpetic whitlow.\nIt is important to get treatment quickly for felons when they are small. If the bacteria pocket continues to expand, it can compress blood vessels in the finger and cut off the fingertip's circulation, causing in permanent damage to the finger. Also, an untreated felon can spread its infection to the bone within the finger. This can lead to a more serious infection, called osteomyelitis, which takes much longer to cure.\nLike other types of infections, felons sometimes begin after the finger is punctured by a wood splinter or something else.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A felon causes extreme pain at the fingertip, especially when pressure is applied to the \"fingerprint\" surface. The end of the finger swells, is warm and turns red. There may be an accumulation of a white, thick discharge (pus). As the felon increases, the fingertip may feel numb, and bending the finger may be painful.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor can usually diagnose a felon just by examining it. He or she will ask whether you have had an injury in the area. Tenderness, redness, firmness and enlargement of the fingertip are all signs of a felon. If you have small bubble-like cysts on the skin, called vesicles, and repeated episodes, it is likely the cause is herpetic whitlow.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Because an enlarging abscess in the finger reduces blood supply into the area, it is hard for your body's immune system to fight this type of infection. Felons almost always need to be opened and drained by a doctor before they can heal. Most clear up within days to weeks. Healing may be faster with aggressive treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you are going to work with wood or other materials that could cause splinters, wear protective gloves. People with diabetes who prick their fingers for home blood tests should first wipe the fingertip with alcohol. Avoiding contact with others who have herpes may prevent herpetic infections, though there may be no way to know in advance who has the infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of a herpetic infection may prevent complications.\n",
      "Treatment": "Felons are usually treated with minor surgery to allow drainage. Typically, your doctor will make the whole finger numb by injecting an anesthetic once into each side of your finger, just beyond the knuckle of the hand. Then he or she will make one or more small cuts in the tip of your finger to allow the pus to drain out. A narrow gauze strip may be left in the wound to hold it open for continued drainage. The gauze may need to be replaced every day or two as it absorbs bacteria and debris from inside the wound.\nYour doctor may prescribe an antibiotic that works against \"staph\" bacteria infections. Antibiotics may be changed if the infection does not clear up promptly or if testing of the pus indicates that the infection is caused by an unusual organism or one that is resistant to the usual antibiotics.  For severe cases, a more extensive operation may be necessary including making a small hole in the nail to allow additional drainage.\nIf the infection is actually a herpetic whitlow rather than a felon, drainage is not performed because it may delay healing or increase the risk of bacterial infection. Herpes infections in the finger tend to clear up on their own. Your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication, such as acyclovir (Zovirax) or valacyclovir (Valtrex), which may help speed recovery.\nIf you have this or any skin or wound infection, make sure you are up-to-date with your tetanus vaccinations.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Because of the complications that can occur from a felon, you should see your doctor and go to an emergency room for immediate care if you develop sudden or severe pain or swelling in a finger.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis is excellent. Felons caused by bacterial infections are curable with drainage and antibiotic treatment. Complications are rare and usually can be prevented with prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n",

      "What is it?": "A fever is an increase in body temperature above the normal range. However, body temperature varies between people, with different levels of activity and at different times of the day. Medical textbooks differ in their definition of the highest normal body temperature. Fever generally can be defined as an early morning temperature higher than 99 degrees Fahrenheit or a temperature higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit at any time of the day.\nA part of the brain called the hypothalamus acts as the body's thermostat. When all is well in the body, the hypothalamus is set at the normal body temperature. Fever develops when the hypothalamus is set to a higher-than-normal temperature. This resetting of the hypothalamus is usually caused by small molecules called pyrogens in the blood.\n\nCauses of fever include:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Common symptoms associated with fever include sweating, shivering, headaches, muscle aches, poor appetite, rash, restlessness and general body weakness. High fever can lead to symptoms of mental dysfunction, such as confusion, excessive sleepiness, irritability and convulsions (seizures).\nConvulsions triggered by fever (febrile seizures) are common among children younger than 5 years. These seizures usually occur at the beginning of an illness when temperature rises rapidly. In infants and toddlers, febrile seizures typically cause generalized shaking and muscle rigidity. They usually last one to three minutes and are often followed by a long period of sleep.\nSpecific symptoms associated with a fever often can provide clues to help identify the fever's cause. For example, a fever accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea may signal gastroenteritis, and a fever associated with coughing, shortness of breath and grayish-yellow phlegm may indicate pneumonia.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "In pinpointing a fever's cause, your doctor may ask about:\nYour doctor will take your temperature orally, in the ear canal or rectally. Depending on the suspected site of infection, your doctor's exam will focus on certain parts of your body:\nDepending on your symptoms and the results of your physical examination, you may need diagnostic tests, including laboratory examination of body fluids (blood, urine, stool or spinal fluid); special X-rays or scans; or a biopsy (taking a sample of body tissue for laboratory examination).\n",
      "Expected duration": "Depending on its cause, a fever may disappear in a day or last for weeks.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can reduce your risk of getting illnesses that cause fever by adopting these healthy habits:\n",
      "Treatment": "Doctors often advise adults with mild to moderate fevers below 102 degrees Fahrenheit to:\nCaution regarding aspirin in children and teenagers. Aspirin should not be given to infants and children younger than age 16 unless specifically prescribed by their doctor. It can lead to a rare but life-threatening neurological disorder called Reye's syndrome. In children, you can consider using acetaminophen or ibuprofen, together with lukewarm sponge baths. If your child has a febrile seizure, call your doctor immediately.\nIf your doctor suspects that a bacterial infection is causing your fever, he or she will prescribe antibiotics.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Adults and children should seek immediate medical attention for any fever of 104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher or for any fever accompanied by one or more of the following:\nCall a doctor immediately if an infant younger than 3 months develops any fever.\nFor a lower fever of unexplained origin, call your doctor if it does not improve after two to three days. Call sooner if you develop additional symptoms.\n",
      "Prognosis": "For most fevers caused by common infections, the person either recovers on their own or the doctor is able to identify and treat the cause.\nSustained body temperatures of 106 degrees Fahrenheit or above can cause brain damage.\n",

      "What are fibroids?": "A fibroid is a lump or growth in the uterus that is not cancerous. Fibroids can be as small as a pea to as large as a basketball. They are usually round and pinkish in color, and they can grow anywhere inside or on the uterus. The female hormone estrogen seems to play a role in stimulating the growth of some fibroids.\nAbout 30% of women older than 30 years have fibroids, and they usually appear between the ages of 35 and 45. Some women are more likely to get fibroids, including black women, women who have never been pregnant and women who have a mother or sister with fibroids.\n",
      "Symptoms of fibroids": "Some women never realize that they have fibroids because they have no symptoms. In other women, uterine fibroids are discovered either during a routine gynecologic exam or during prenatal care.\nWhen symptoms of fibroids occur, they can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing fibroids": "Usually, a woman doesn't realize that she has a fibroid until her gynecologist feels it during a pelvic exam. If your gynecologist thinks you have a fibroid, several tests can confirm the diagnosis:\n",
      "Expected duration of fibroids": "The number of fibroids, their size and how fast they grow varies among women. Female hormones encourage fibroids to grow, so they continue growing until menopause. Some fibroids shrink after menopause. However, larger fibroids may change little or become only slightly smaller in size. If a woman has had fibroids removed surgically, new fibroids can appear any time before she enters menopause.\n",
      "Preventing fibroids": "There are no proven measures you can take to prevent fibroids from developing. Studies show that athletic women seem to be less likely to develop fibroids than women who are obese or who don't exercise.\n",
      "Treating fibroids": "If fibroids are small and are not causing any symptoms, they do not need to be treated. Your gynecologist may do a pelvic examination every six months to a year to make sure that your fibroids are not growing rapidly. In some cases, medications can be prescribed to control any abnormal bleeding and temporarily shrink the fibroids.\nMedications used to shrink fibroids, such as leuprolide (Lupron), create a temporary menopause by stopping the ovaries from making the female hormone estrogen. While estrogen levels drop and menstrual periods stop, menopausal hot flashes appear and fibroids stop growing and slowly shrink. This helps to stop blood loss from heavy, prolonged periods. However, when the medication is stopped periods return, hot flashes disappear and fibroids that have not been removed will start growing again. These medications usually are given by needle injection in a large muscle.\nFibroids may need to be removed if they cause significant symptoms or are large enough to interfere with fertility. Growths in your uterus also may need to be removed if it is difficult for your doctor to tell whether they are fibroids or cancer. There are several options for removing fibroids:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should call your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms:\nCall your doctor immediately if you experience severe pelvic pain, or if you develop severe bleeding from your vagina.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Fibroids often shrink after menopause because they need female hormones to grow. Many women have small- to moderate-size fibroids throughout their childbearing years that cause them few or no problems. Several medical and surgical options are available to treat or remove troublesome fibroids without having to remove the uterus.\n",

      "What is it?": "People with fibromyalgia have widespread pain, aches, and stiffness in muscles and joints throughout the body, along with unusual tiredness. There is no known cause of fibromyalgia. In addition, doctors can't find any other explanation for the symptoms. Blood tests, x-rays, and other tests usually are normal in people with fibromyalgia.\nFibromyalgia is a controversial illness. Some physicians don't believe that it's a medical illness but think it may be a reflection of psychological distress or stress. However, there's no proof of a psychological cause either. Until we have a better understanding of the disorder, it's likely to remain controversial.\nIt may be that fibromyalgia has more than one cause. Some researchers have suggested that it's related to abnormalities in a non-dream part of the sleep cycle or to low levels of serotonin, a brain chemical that regulates sleep and pain perception. Other theories have linked fibromyalgia to alterations in the threshold at which a person experiences pain. Still others have cited physical or psychological trauma, blood-flow abnormalities in the muscles, viral infections, or other infections as possible triggers of fibromyalgia.\nFibromyalgia affects an estimated 3.4% of women and 0.5% of men in the United States, or 3 million to 6 million Americans. It most commonly affects women of childbearing age or older. In fact, some estimates suggest that more than 7% of women in their 70s have fibromyalgia. Many people with fibromyalgia also have psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, or eating disorders, although the relationship between fibromyalgia and mental health disorders remains unclear.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Fibromyalgia can cause pain and stiffness in the muscles and joints almost anywhere in the body, including the trunk, neck, shoulders, back, and hips. People often have pain between the shoulder blades and at the bottom of the neck. Pain may be either a general soreness or a gnawing ache, and stiffness is often worst in the morning.\nTypically, people also complain of feeling abnormally tired, especially of waking up tired, although they have slept well. Many people with fibromyalgia also have tender points, which are specific spots on the body that are painful to touch. Some people report symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, depression, anxiety, and headache.\nFor research studies, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has established criteria for fibromyalgia that include a combination of unexplained symptoms such as pain, fatigue, waking without feeling rested, and/or problems with thinking or memory. But doctors often make the diagnosis in people with widespread pain and no other identifiable cause, even if criteria are not met.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "After asking about your symptoms, your doctor will check for swelling, redness, and impaired movement in parts of your body where you're having pain. Your doctor will also check for tender points (although the presence of tender points is not required to make the diagnosis).\nYour doctor will ask detailed questions about your medical history and examine you to rule out other conditions or diseases that could explain your symptoms, such as thyroid disease or vitamin D deficiency.\n",
      "Expected duration": "The symptoms of fibromyalgia are usually chronic. While treatment can be helpful, symptoms tend to be long-lasting (and frequently lifelong).\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no known way to prevent fibromyalgia.\n",
      "Treatment": "Standard treatment of fibromyalgia includes both nonmedication and medication approaches.\nNonmedication treatments may be much more helpful than medications. Aerobic exercise, such as low-impact stepping, cycling, or swimming several times each week, is considered an essential part of treatment. A physical therapist or trainer can be helpful in developing an individualized exercise program.\nImproved sleep quality may improve symptoms, so it may help to avoid caffeine, exercise late in the day, and fluids late in the evening.\nIf your symptoms do not improve, your doctor also may suggest that you try one or more of the following therapies: acupuncture, massage therapy, warm compresses, biofeedback, tai chi, hypnosis, group therapy, or stress management. If you have symptoms of depression or anxiety, these may improve with psychotherapy and antidepressant or antianxiety medication.\nEducation about the disease and treatment of accompanying conditions (such as sleep apnea) can make a big difference.\nWhile no medication reliably cures fibromyalgia, medications can provide at least some relief. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brand names); aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, and others) or naproxen (Aleve); a muscle relaxant such as cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril); or an antidepressant such as amitriptyline (Elavil) or fluoxetine (Prozac). Sometimes these medicines are prescribed in combination. For example, the combination of amitriptyline and fluoxetine (taken at different times of the day) may help more than either alone.\nIn recent years, the FDA has approved pregabalin (Lyrica), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and milnacipran (Savella) for the treatment of fibromyalgia. However, studies have not yet compared these with older medications for the long-term treatment of this condition. A number of other medicines, including gabapentin (Neurontin), tramadol (Ultram), and tizanidine (Zanaflex), are commonly prescribed for fibromyalgia.\nEach person with fibromyalgia is different, so people may have significantly different treatment plans than the measures outlined above.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you experience chronic pain or extreme tiredness, especially if it interferes with your ability to work, sleep, do normal household chores, or enjoy recreational activities.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Studies do not agree about the outlook for people with fibromyalgia. For example, results from some specialized treatment centers show a poor outlook. However, community-based treatment programs show that symptoms go away in a quarter of patients and symptoms significantly improve in about half.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Fifth disease, also known as erythema infectiosum, is a common viral infection among school-aged children. It is caused by parvovirus B19, which spreads through direct contact with fluids or mucus from the nose or mouth of an infected person. Fifth disease causes a bright red \"slapped cheek\" rash that doesn't appear until an infected person is no longer contagious. Fifth disease usually is a mild illness, and some people who are infected may never realize they have it.\n\nOutbreaks of fifth disease typically occur in late winter and early spring. When outbreaks occur among schoolchildren, 10% to 60% of susceptible children may develop symptoms. Parvovirus B19 infects humans only and is not the same as the parvovirus that infects dogs.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Sometimes, fifth disease does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include mild cold symptoms (stuffy nose, runny nose, slight fever), body aches, headache and fatigue. These symptoms pass after three or four days and are followed primarily in children by a rash that is bright red and usually begins on the cheeks (the \"slapped cheek\" rash). This facial rash is followed by a lacy, flat rash that appears on the arms, legs, trunk and buttocks. The blotchy rash may itch, and it may last from several days to several weeks before it fades. Even after the rash clears, it sometimes may reappear if the skin is irritated by rubbing, heat, cold, exercise or exposure to sunlight.\nAdolescents and adults with fifth disease may not have any symptoms or they may develop the typical rash, joint pain and swelling (most often at the knuckles, wrists and knees) or both.\nChildren who have blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and hemolytic anemia, and those with immune deficiency or cancer rarely get the rash of fifth disease. Instead, they may develop severe anemia (not enough red blood cells) as a result of being infected with parvovirus B19. The symptoms can include paleness, rapid breathing, rapid pulse, fever and malaise (a general sick feeling).\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Usually, your doctor can diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical \"slapped cheek\" rash without fever or other signs of illness. Fifth disease rarely is diagnosed before the rash appears, since there may not be any early symptoms or they are mild and nonspecific. In rare cases, blood tests are done to look for specific antibodies against parvovirus B19. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to help protect the body against viruses or other invaders. The virus itself, or its viral DNA (genetic map), also can be detected in the blood of some patients.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Fifth disease usually goes away within three weeks, but the rash may last longer. Although joint pains in adolescents may last for a few weeks or months, there are typically no long-term joint problems.\n",
      "Prevention": "Fifth disease is spread in the droplets of coughs and sneezes, on dirty tissues, and on drinking glasses and eating utensils. It is difficult to avoid exposure to the illness, because fifth disease is most contagious three to 14 days before its characteristic rash appears. During this time, most infected people don't know that they are ill and capable of spreading their illness to others.\nWhen outbreaks of fifth disease occur in a community, frequent hand washing may help to prevent spread of the illness. It is especially important to wash your hands before you eat and after you have touched contaminated items (dirty tissues, drinking glasses, eating utensils). Currently there is no approved vaccine against fifth disease, although at least one vaccine is being tested.\n",
      "Treatment": "Since fifth disease is a mild illness, it usually does not require treatment. Home care for a child whose rash itches may include oatmeal baths or other over-the-counter bath treatments. Adolescents with joint pain may be treated with over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others). Aspirin should never be given to children with fever or flu-like illness, including fifth disease, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious brain problem that develops in some children who have had certain viral illnesses and have been treated with aspirin.\nChildren and adults with blood disorders (sickle cell anemia, hemolytic anemia), and children who have cancer or an immune deficiency, are at increased risk of serious illness as a result of fifth disease. Patients with an immune deficiency may be given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) that contains antibodies against parvovirus B19.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Call your doctor if you or your child develops a facial rash, especially if your child has a blood disorder or an immune deficiency, or is being treated for cancer. Also, call your doctor if a child with previously diagnosed fifth disease develops a fever or increased joint pain.\nPregnant women who believe they have been exposed to fifth disease or who develop a rash should call their doctors immediately. Although fifth disease in the mother usually does not threaten the unborn child, fifth disease in rare cases can cause miscarriage or fetal anemia.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Previously healthy people usually recover completely from fifth disease within weeks.\n",

      "What is it?": "A finger dislocation is a joint injury in which the finger bones move apart or sideways so the ends of the bones are no longer aligned normally. Finger dislocations usually happen when the finger is bent backward beyond its normal limit of motion.\nThe bones that make up the joints of  the fingers are known by the medical terms phalanges and metacarpal bones. Any of these joints can be dislocated in an injury:\n",
      "Symptoms": "A dislocated finger is crooked, painful and swollen, and its surface skin may be cut, scraped or bruised. If a dislocated finger has been straightened on the playing field, it may feel abnormally loose, weak or unstable afterward.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will suspect that your finger is dislocated if it appears deformed after an injury. In some cases, your doctor may order an X-ray of the finger to look for a fracture. When a finger bone is pulled away from connected tendons, it is common for a fragment of bone to separate from the main bone and stay with the tendon, a condition known as an avulsion fracture. Such fractures commonly accompany finger dislocations.\n",
      "Expected duration": "You can return to your sport once your dislocated finger has been realigned, your doctor has confirmed that the injured joint is stable and no bone is fractured, and your finger tenderness and swelling have improved. For a few weeks, you will need to wear a padded finger splint or buddy tape, which is used to strap the injured finger to an uninjured finger nearby for support.\nIf you need surgery to repair your dislocated finger, it usually takes at least four to six weeks before you can return to your sport.\n",
      "Prevention": "After your dislocated finger has been treated, you often can prevent it from being injured again by using a protective splint or taping it to another finger. If repeated dislocations occur, surgery may be recommended.\n",
      "Treatment": "A dislocated finger can be corrected with or without injecting local anesthesia. To correct the dislocation, the doctor will press against the displaced bone to dislodge the bone if it is caught against the side of the joint. As the end of the bone is freed, the doctor can pull outward to restore the bone to its correct position. This is called closed reduction. Once your finger joint is back in its normal position, you will wear a splint or tape the finger to another finger for three to six weeks, depending on the specific type of your dislocation.\nIf your doctor cannot straighten your finger using closed reduction or if your injured joint is not stable after closed reduction, your dislocated finger may need to be repaired surgically. Surgery is also used to treat finger dislocations that are complicated by large fractures or fractures that involves the joint.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you injure your finger and your finger is crooked, deformed, painful or swollen. If you are an athlete and someone straightens your injured finger on the playing field, check with your doctor to make sure that the injured joint is stable and not fractured. A dislocated joint that has an open wound should not be moved. It should be carefully splinted and evaluated immediately by a physician.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The long-term outlook is usually good, although it may take four to six months for your finger pain to disappear. In some cases, there is also a small amount of permanent swelling around the injured joint, especially an injured proximal interphalangeal joint. In athletes, a finger that has been dislocated often is injured again.\n",

      "What is it?": "Influenza (the flu) is a respiratory infection. It is caused by the influenza virus. Influenza typically is spread by air or by direct contact from one person to another. Influenza virus is very contagious.\nMost influenza cases occur during epidemics. Epidemics usually peak during the winter months. A particularly widespread and severe epidemic is called a pandemic.\nCompared with other viruses, influenza can strike remarkably large numbers of people in a relatively short time. In the developed nations, up to 10-15% of the people get the flu each year. During severe epidemics, a greater fraction of the population gets sick.\nThe most common types of influenza virus are A and B. Influenza A is the one usually responsible for the annual epidemics. Most people get multiple flu infections during their lives. With many other types of infections, having the disease once protects against a second infection. That is because the body's immune system remembers the returning virus. It attacks it immediately, and rapidly eliminates it.\nWith influenza, the virus usually has mutated (changed) somewhat since the first infection. The change is enough to fool your immune system. As a result, the immune system responds slowly. By the time the immune response is in full gear, millions of the body's cells are already infected.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Flu can cause a variety of symptoms. They can be mild or severe. Symptoms and illness severity depend on the type of virus, your age and overall health.\nAlthough it is a respiratory virus, flu can affect other body systems. This makes you feel sick all over. Symptoms can include any or all of the following:\nDangerous complications, such as pneumonia, can develop from flu. The influenza virus can be the direct cause of pneumonia. But also infection with influenza makes a person more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia.\nCertain people are especially vulnerable to complications. These include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will evaluate your symptoms. Flu is likely to cause fever, coughing, chills and muscle aches. Flu tends to occur during winter months.\nDoctors usually assume the diagnosis is flu when you have symptoms of influenza in the winter. If your symptoms or physical examination suggest something other than the flu, your doctor may order a blood test. He or she will swab your nose and throat for influenza testing.\nYour doctor may order a chest X-ray. This is likely if he or she suspects that the influenza virus has caused pneumonia or may lead to a bacterial superinfection.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Influenza symptoms can last for as few as 24 hours or for a week or more. A typical case lasts four or five days. As long as you have symptoms, you are contagious.\n",
      "Prevention": "Options for heading off an attack of influenza have increased in recent years.\nFor maximum effectiveness, doctors advise getting vaccinated at the start of flu season. This generally means October or November. There are a number of different types of vaccinations available to prevent influenza. They vary by how they are given (for example, by injection or inhaled through the nose), by the type and number of virus strains covered and by the method of vaccination production (for example, using an altered live virus or an inactivated virus).\nRecommendations vary for different people and from year-to-year so ask your doctor which specific vaccination is best for you.\nOther ways to protect yourself from getting the flu include:\nPracticing good hygiene can help you to avoid getting the flu or spreading it to others. Good hygiene includes covering your mouth when you cough and washing your hands frequently.\n",
      "Treatment": "To ease symptoms, your doctor will recommend that you rest and drink plenty of fluids.\nFor fever and body aches, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers. The antiviral drugs baloxavir (Xofluza), oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab) or zanamivir (Relenza) are also options, depending on how long you've been sick (since treatment may speed recovery only if started soon after the onset of symptoms), severity of symptoms and risk factors for complications. In general, starting one of these medications three or more days after the onset of flu symptoms is unlikely to be effective.\nBecause flu is a viral infection, antibiotics are not effective.\nChildren who are suspected of having flu, and who have high fevers should be given acetaminophen (Tylenol). They should never be given aspirin to treat the fever. This can cause a serious illness called Reye's syndrome.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have a chronic disease and suddenly get flu symptoms, call your doctor's office. You may benefit from starting an antiviral medication within 48 hours.\nYou also should notify your doctor if you have flulike symptoms along with\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people recover fully from the flu. But some develop serious complications. Complications can include life-threatening conditions such as pneumonia.\n",

      "What is a food allergy?": "A food allergy is a reaction by the body's immune system to something in a food, usually a protein; the body mistakenly acts like it is a germ or some other invader, and does its best to defend itself.\nWhile any food could possibly cause an allergy, certain foods are much more likely to do so. In children, the foods that most commonly cause allergic reactions are:\nMost allergic reactions occur within 30 minutes of consuming the problem food. Often, the reaction occurs within five to 10 minutes, but it can occur as long as four to six hours after ingestion.\nFood allergy is different from food intolerance. In food intolerance, there is a physical reaction to a food, but that reaction isn't allergic. Lactose intolerance is a common example. People who suffer from this have trouble digesting one of the sugars in milk, and can have stomachaches or diarrhea when they drink milk or eat dairy products.\nWhile the symptoms of food intolerance can be uncomfortable, this condition is not dangerous. There are also other conditions such as celiac disease that can cause reactions to foods (people with celiac disease have trouble with anything containing gluten) that are not allergic.\nAnother form of allergy is called oral allergy syndrome. People who have this get itching of the lips, mouth, and throat (and sometimes swollen lips) after eating certain fruits or vegetables. This is rarely dangerous.\nFood allergies are becoming more common, especially among children. While the exact cause of food allergy is unknown, it does tend to run in families.\n",
      "Symptoms of food allergy": "It's not always easy to know when someone has a food allergy, because there are many different symptoms. They include:\nIn severe cases, a dangerous reaction called anaphylaxis can happen. This whole-body allergic reaction combines many of the symptoms mentioned above, and can lead to death if not treated immediately.\n",
      "Diagnosing food allergy": "Many times, the diagnosis of food allergy can be made by the history. For example, if a child has hives or swelling of the face after eating something with peanuts, they are likely allergic to peanuts. But because symptoms can be so varied and food exposures so numerous, the diagnosis is sometimes harder to make. A detailed diary of food intake and symptoms and information about food allergies in the family can be helpful. But your doctor may need to do testing to be sure.\nThere are two commonly used tests:\nSkin tests.The allergy skin-prick test involves pricking the skin with a solution of the suspected food. A positive test will produce a small hivelike reaction.\nThe downside of this test is that it is uncomfortable – and for children with eczema or other skin conditions, the results may be difficult to interpret. And in children with severe allergies, even the small amount of the food injected into the skin can cause significant reactions.\nAnother problem with skin tests is that in order for them to be truly reliable, the patient can't take any antihistamines for about two weeks before the test. For children who suffer with bad hay fever or other allergies, two weeks without antihistamines may be challenging.\nBlood tests.Laboratory tests can measure the amount of food-specific IgE in the blood. IgE antibodies are made by the body in response to allergens. Once you have developed these IgE antibodies, they are constantly circulating in your blood. Therefore, this blood test can be done at any time. The greater the amount of IgE, the higher the probability the person has an allergy to that particular food.\nThese tests have the advantage of being less uncomfortable (one needle stick for the blood test instead of a bunch of needle sticks for the skin test) and can be done without stopping antihistamines. The downside of these tests (besides the expense) is that they can have both false positive and false negative results.\nA supervised \"food challenge\" is sometimes recommended to evaluate suspected food allergy. This should only be performed by an allergy specialist with experience treating food allergies and who has the necessary medications and equipment to handle sever reactions.\n",
      "Preventing food allergy": "Previously, experts believed that avoiding foods that commonly cause allergies early in life could help prevent allergies. Research now shows that the opposite is true. Exposing infants to foods such as peanuts (being careful to avoid any choking risk) may prevent allergies. This is particularly true for infants who have severe eczema, or who have a family history of food allergies. Talk to your doctor about the best plan for your child.\nFor older children who have developed allergies, the best way to avoid an allergic reaction is to avoid the food or foods that cause a reaction. Here are some steps you can take.\nNewer preventive options include oral immunotherapy (OIT) and a medication called omalizumab (Xolair).\nOIT is a type of desensitization in which a person consumes a tiny amount of the food (or a small portion of the food) and then gradually increases the amount. OIT can reduce the frequency and severity of food allergies. Currently, OIT is only approved for peanut allergies, although some health care providers offer OIT for other foods.\nOmalizumab is an antibody treatment that blocks IgE and is FDA-approved for adults and children who are at least 1 year of age to prevent anaphylaxis due to inadvertent exposure to one or more foods.\nThere are significant limitations to both of these newer approaches including cost, uncertain effectiveness, and the continued need to avoid the problematic foods.\n",
      "Expected duration of food allergy": "While most children outgrow food allergies, some carry them into adulthood. Teenagers need to be aware of food allergies they had as children and not assume they have outgrown them. In particular, allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish usually are not outgrown.\n",
      "Treating food allergy": "For minor allergic reactions, over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines or nasal sprays can be used to relieve the symptoms. Talk to your doctor about the best medication for your child.\nSevere reactions require prompt medical attention. Epinephrine via an injection device can be lifesaving. If epinephrine is used, the child still needs medical attention, as symptoms can return once the medication wears off. All those caring for the child should be instructed to either call 911 or take the child directly to an emergency room (never take the child yourself if there is any trouble breathing or the child appears ill — always call 911).\nThere are new treatments for allergy that are undergoing research; hopefully, we will have more ways to prevent and treat them in the future.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you or your child develops allergic symptoms after eating, call a health care professional immediately. If breathing difficulties occur, call 911.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The symptoms of food allergy can range from mild to life-threatening. If a food or ingredient is easy to avoid, the allergy may interfere very little with daily life. Some foods and ingredients, however, are widespread, and avoiding them will involve careful monitoring. Some food allergies disappear as a child ages.\n",

      "What is it?": "Most commonly, food poisoning is a reaction to food or water contaminated during improper cooking, handling or storage. The most common contaminants are bacteria, such assalmonella, CampylobacterandE. coli.Other contaminants include viruses, parasitesandtoxins. Food poisoning usually leads to abdominal cramping, vomiting and diarrhea.\nFood poisoning, although common, often can be prevented easily. An estimated 85% of food-poisoning incidents can be prevented by handling and preparing food properly. Usually, symptoms subside within a day or two. However, in some cases, food poisoning is quite dangerous.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of food poisoning include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of symptoms alone, and fortified if there is an accompanying history of a person eating with you who also became sick. If a doctor wants to pinpoint the microorganism that caused the food poisoning, you will be asked to provide a stool sample to be examined in a laboratory. Your doctor also may want to take a sample of your blood for testing. If you have some of the food that might have made you sick, ask your doctor if it is important to test for infectious organisms or a toxin. The sample can be cultured in a laboratory, which means it is placed on a special material that encourages organisms that may be in the sample to grow, so they can be identified.\nUp to 80% of food poisoning is related to eating commercially prepared foods or institutional foods. In such cases, questioning others who have eaten the same foods may help to determine the cause.\nInformation about the length of time between eating the food and the beginning of symptoms can help in diagnosing the problem:\n",
      "Expected duration": "In general, food poisoning goes away in one to three days, although some types of food poisoning may last much longer.\n",
      "Prevention": "To prevent food poisoning, select safe foods. Take the following steps:\nStore foods properly:\nPrepare foods safely:\nBe aware that food served in restaurants or institutions may not have been stored at the proper temperature, and that food handlers may not have the best personal hygiene. When eating at a restaurant, order cautiously. Be wary of soft cheeses, raw seafood and anything that contains raw eggs.\nFood irradiation is another effective means to prevent food poisoning. During irradiation, foods are exposed briefly to a radiant energy source, such as gamma rays or electron beams, within a shielded facility. Irradiation is not a substitute for properly manufacturing and handling food. The process, however, can kill harmful bacteria and greatly reduce potential hazards, especially when used to treat meat and dairy products. Irradiation is a controversial practice and is not well accepted in some areas of the world. Irradiated foods are not widely available in the United States.\n",
      "Treatment": "Because large amounts of fluids are lost through vomiting and diarrhea, treatment of food poisoning focuses on preventing dehydration. If you have food poisoning, you must drink fluids, even if you have trouble keeping them down.\nOnce you can tolerate fluids without vomiting, you can begin to add bland foods to your diet. If vomiting or diarrhea persists for more than 24 hours, a doctor may prescribe medications to suppress nausea, and may provide fluids intravenously. For some infectious causes of food poisoning, antibiotics may be recommended. People with very severe food poisoning may need to be admitted to a hospital.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call a doctor immediately if food poisoning is suspected in:\nIf you are otherwise healthy, you should call a doctor if:\n",
      "Prognosis": "For most people, food poisoning is an unpleasant experience that lasts for a day or two, then passes. In very young children, elderly people, people with compromised immune systems and pregnant women, it can be dangerous. Anyone in these risk groups should go to an emergency room immediately.\n",

      "What is it?": "A foot sprain is a tear of ligaments, the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to one another inside a joint. Sprains range in severity from Grade I to Grade III.\nBecause the foot bears the entire body's weight with each step and contains numerous bones and joints, you may expect the foot to be at high risk of sprains. However, sprains of the foot are fairly rare, except in people who participate in certain sports or occupations that subject the feet to abnormal twisting motions or bends.\nWhen foot sprains occur, they usually involve one of two distinct areas:\nMidfoot— The midfoot is the central area that includes the arch of the foot. In athletes, midfoot sprains usually occur because of a sports-related fall, a collision or an isolated twist of the midfoot, particularly during snowboarding, windsurfing, horseback riding or competitive diving. Among female ballet dancers, midfoot sprains typically happen when the dancer loses her balance while en pointe (on her toes) and spinning or when she lands with her foot abnormally flexed or rotated after a jump. Among people who do not compete in high-risk activities, about one-third of midfoot sprains happen by accident, simply because of an odd twist of the foot during an ordinary stumble or fall. Less often, severe midfoot sprains are the result of high-impact trauma, especially trauma caused by a motor vehicle collision or a fall from a high place. This type of injury is likely to produce not only Grade III sprains, but also foot fractures and open wounds.\nFirst metatarsophalangeal joint— This is the joint at the base of the big toe. A sprain of this joint is commonly called \"turf toe.\" It is usually caused by hyperextension (extreme backward bending) of the big toe. The typical scenario involves either a football player or a ballet dancer who falls forward while the big toe is planted flat against the ground. In football, turf toe is most common in players who wear lightweight soccer-style shoes while competing on artificial playing surfaces. The relatively flexible soles of their shoes probably don't offer enough protection for the first metatarsophalangeal joint, increasing the risk of a turf toe injury. The situation is probably similar for ballet dancers, particularly males.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In a mild or moderate midfoot sprain, your midfoot area will be swollen and tender, and there may be some local bruising (black and blue discoloration). In more severe sprains, you may not be able to bear weight on your injured foot.\nIf you have turf toe, the base of your big toe will be painful and swollen.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "After reviewing your symptoms, your doctor will ask you to describe exactly how you injured your foot. He or she also will want to know about your occupation, recreational activities, participation in sports, any previous foot trauma or foot surgery and the type of shoes you usually wear.\nThe doctor then will examine your feet, comparing your injured foot with the uninjured one. During this exam, your doctor will note any swelling or bruising, as well as any changes in flexibility or range of motion. Your doctor also will gently press and feel your injured foot to check for tenderness or bone abnormalities.\nIf you cannot bear weight on your injured foot or if the results of your physical examination suggest that you may have a more severe foot injury, X-rays of the foot may be recommended.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the foot may be done in certain patients, especially professional dancers or athletes, who have unusual pain or joint instability in spite of having normal X-ray results.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Mild midfoot sprains usually heal within a few weeks, whereas more severe sprains may take up to two months. The pain of turf toe usually subsides within two to three weeks.\n",
      "Prevention": "In some cases, you may be able to prevent foot sprains by wearing stiff-soled shoes or by taping or bracing the foot to help stabilize it. A stretching and strengthening program can help to prevent sprains.\n",
      "Treatment": "For milder midfoot sprains, initial treatment follows theRICErule:\nYour doctor also may suggest that you take acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) for pain or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others), to relieve pain and ease swelling.\nFor more severe midfoot sprains, especially in dancers and other professionals whose livelihoods depend on their feet, the doctor may immobilize the foot in a cast and recommend temporarily avoiding bearing weight on the injured foot. As symptoms subside, you can gradually resume weight-bearing and other normal activities, and you will need to start a rehabilitation program of stretching and strengthening. Because a serious midfoot sprain can threaten the career of professional athletes or dancers, they often need to follow special treatment and rehabilitation regimens to ensure that the injured foot heals with a proper balance of flexibility and stability.\nTurf toe usually is treated withRICE, an NSAID and splinting. To help protect the injured joint, your doctor may recommend that you wear stiff-soled shoes or use a shoe insert.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have symptoms of a sprained foot, such as pain, swelling or bruising, especially if pain prevents you from bearing weight on your injured foot or does not subside over a day or two.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Because most sprains heal with time, the outlook is usually excellent, particularly in people who do not participate in high-risk activities that twist or bend the feet. In rare cases, a midfoot sprain may cause long-term complications, such as chronic (long-lasting) foot pain or a fallen arch.\n",

      "What is it?": "A foot ulcer is an open sore on the foot.\nA foot ulcer can be a shallow red crater that involves only the surface skin. A foot ulcer also can be very deep. A deep foot ulcer may be a crater that extends through the full thickness of the skin. It may involve tendons, bones, and other deep structures.\nPeople with diabetes and people with poor circulation are more likely to develop foot ulcers. It can be difficult to heal a foot ulcer. In people with these conditions, even a small foot ulcer can become infected if it does not heal quickly.\nIf an infection occurs in an ulcer and is not treated right away, it can develop into\nAmong people with diabetes, most severe foot infections that ultimately require some part of the toe, foot, or lower leg to be amputated start as a foot ulcer.\nPeripheral neuropathy.This is nerve damage in the feet or lower legs. Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy. When nerves in the feet are damaged, they can no longer warn about pain or discomfort. When this happens, tight-fitting shoes can trigger a foot ulcer by rubbing on a part of the foot that has become numb.\nPeople with peripheral neuropathy may not be able to feel when they've stepped on something sharp or when they have an irritating pebble in their shoe. They can injure their feet significantly and never know it, unless they examine their feet routinely for injury.\nMany elderly people and diabetics with vision problems also can't see their feet well enough to examine them for problems.\nCirculatory problems.Any illness that decreases circulation to the feet can cause foot ulcers. Less blood reaches the feet, which deprives cells of oxygen. This makes the skin more vulnerable to injury. And it slows the foot's ability to heal.\nPoor circulation in the leg arteries is called peripheral artery disease. It also causes pain in the leg or buttock during walking. It is caused by atherosclerosis. This is a disease in which fatty deposits of cholesterol build up inside arteries.\nAbnormalities in the bones or muscles of the feet.Any condition that distorts the normal anatomy of the foot can lead to foot ulcers. This is particularly true if the foot is forced into shoes that don't fit the foot's altered shape. Examples are claw feet, feet with fractures, and cases of severe arthritis.\nMore than any other group, people with diabetes have a particularly high risk of developing foot ulcers. This is because the long-term complications of diabetes often include neuropathy and circulatory problems. Without prompt and proper treatment, a foot ulcer may require hospital treatment. Or, it may lead to deep infection or gangrene and amputation.\nIn addition to diabetes, other medical conditions that increase the risk of foot ulcers include:\nIt is rare for a foot ulcer to be unrelated to these risk factors and illnesses. A foot ulcer in a person who has none of these health problems may need to be checked for skin cancer, especially squamous cell carcinoma. This cancer occasionally looks like a foot ulcer.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A foot ulcer looks like a red crater in the skin. Most foot ulcers are located on the side or bottom of the foot or on the top or tip of a toe. This round crater can be surrounded by a border of thickened, callused skin. This border may develop over time. In very severe ulcers, the red crater may be deep enough to expose tendons or bones.\nIf the nerves in the foot are functioning normally, then the ulcer will be painful. If not, then a person with a foot ulcer may not know it is there, particularly if the ulcer is located on a less obvious portion of the foot.\nIn disabled or elderly patients, a relative or caregiver may be the one who becomes aware of the problem. The caregiver may notice that foot looks red and swollen. There may be drainage on the sock and a foul odor.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "In most cases, your doctor can tell that you have a foot ulcer simply by looking at your foot.\nIf you have diabetes, your doctor will assess your control of your blood sugar. He or she will ask about the care that you take to keep your feet healthy. The doctor will ask about the type of shoes that you usually wear.\nYour doctor will evaluate the ulcer to determine\nYour doctor may ask you to walk as part of your examination. This is because your gait may highlight knee and ankle abnormalities that cause abnormal pressure spots on the feet. Your doctor also will look for other foot problems, such as claw foot or fallen arches.\nTo check for neuropathy, your doctor may\nYour doctor also can test the circulation in your legs and feet. He or she can do this by feeling your pulses and noting whether your feet are pink and warm. If your pulses are weakened, then your doctor may use Doppler ultrasound to test your circulation.\nYour doctor may use a cotton swab or other thin probe to examine the ulcer itself. These tools can be used to see how deep the ulcer is. And they can help check for exposed tendons or bones. Your doctor will look closely for redness around the ulcer. A large margin of redness can be a sign of cellulitis.\nYour doctor may order other tests to better understand the extent of the ulcer and to determine whether it is infected. These tests may include\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long a foot ulcer lasts depends on\nIn people who have good circulation and good medical care, an ulcer sometimes can heal in as few as three to six weeks. Deeper ulcers may take 12 to 20 weeks. They sometimes require surgery.\n",
      "Prevention": "People who are at risk of foot ulcers, such as those with diabetes, can take steps to help prevent foot ulcers. They can do this by examining their feet routinely and following good foot-hygiene practices.\nThe following strategies may help prevent foot ulcers:\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have good circulation in your foot, your doctor may treat your foot ulcer with a procedure called debridement. This consists of trimming away diseased tissue. He or she also will remove any nearby callused skin.\nThe doctor then will apply a dressing. He or she may prescribe specialized footwear to relieve pressure on the ulcerated area. This specialized footwear may be a cast. Or it may be a loosely fitting postoperative walking shoe or sandal that can be worn over a bandage.\nDepending on the size and depth of a diabetic foot ulcer, your doctor will determine how frequently you need to be reexamined. If the ulcer is debrided, you will need to be seen often. A nurse may need to visit you to change the dressing every several days. Care of a foot ulcer may require multiple visits over weeks or months. The visits will last for as long as it takes for your ulcer to heal completely. If there is a possibility of infection, you may be given antibiotics.\nOnce the ulcer has healed, your doctor may prescribe roomy, well-cushioned footwear. This footwear should not put pressure on vulnerable areas of your feet. This will help to prevent ulcers in the future.\nFoot ulcers that do not respond to more conservative therapy may require surgery. In certain situations, without leg surgery, the ulcer may not heal properly.\nPeople with poor circulation may need a procedure or surgery to open one or more blocked arteries in the legs. When possible, doctors will try to open the blockage with angioplasty. This is usually done by threading a deflated balloon with a wire mesh cover (called a stent) into the blocked area. The balloon is inflated. This opens the artery. The stent stays in place to hold the artery open. For more significant blood flow problems, surgery is usually needed to re-route blood flow through the leg using a bypass artery.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have diabetes, poor circulation, or peripheral neuropathy, examine your feet every day. Call your doctor promptly if you see an area of\nAlso call if you see any other problem on the foot surface.\n",
      "Prognosis": "When foot ulcers are not deep, the outlook for healing is good if circulation to the foot is adequate. With the best wound-care methods available, most ulcers heal within 12 weeks.\nHowever, about one in three healed ulcers return. This is most likely in people who do not wear specialized footwear prescribed by their doctors.\n",

      "What is it?": "Eyelashes prevent most particles or objects from entering the eye, and tears usually are able to rinse out particles that do get in the eye. Occasionally, a solid object or projectile can adhere to the eye or embed itself below the surface of the eye.\nForeign bodies in the eye can be small specks of dirt or eyelashes, or larger objects such as cinders, rust or glass. The eye is damaged easily.\nThe most common type of eye injury is a corneal abrasion — a scratch in the cornea, the transparent layer that lies over your pupil (the center of your eye) and iris (the colored part). If the foreign body sticks to the undersurface of the eyelid, the scratch occurs when the object rubs against the cornea as you blink, and the scratch will be in a vertical line. Alternatively the foreign particle may be stuck to the clear cornea.\nSmall foreign bodies on the white of the eye actually often do not cause much discomfort.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms can include itching, irritation or redness of the eye. If you have a corneal abrasion, you may have eye pain, light sensitivity and blurry vision.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If you visit your doctor, he or she will shine a light into your eye to look for the object and may use a cotton swab to turn your eyelid up. Your doctor will examine the edges of your eye as you look in different directions. Sometimes eye drops containing a local anesthetic agent are used to make this examination more comfortable.\nYour doctor should check your vision using an eye chart. If your doctor suspects that you may have a corneal abrasion, he or she can examine your eye after applying a small amount of \"fluorescein\" dye to the surface. Your doctor may apply the dye using a paper strip. When the strip touches your eye, a film of fluorescein will mix with your tears and float easily across the surface of your eye. Fluorescein collects in areas that are injured and glows when viewed under blue light.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Some foreign objects can be removed easily and do not damage the eye. Others are more difficult to remove and can injure the eye.\nWith proper treatment, symptoms of a mild corneal abrasion almost always improve or disappear completely within 24 to 48 hours. For more severe abrasions, symptoms often last longer.\n",
      "Prevention": "Use protective eyewear at work if appropriate, such as during construction work and when playing sports. At work, protective eyewear can reduce the risk of a corneal abrasion by up to 90% because these abrasions often happen when a foreign object gets in the eye. If you play a sport, use goggles to protect your eyes from sand, dirt and other objects. If you need glasses to see clearly, you can have goggles made with prescription lenses.\nIf you wear contact lenses, wash your hands thoroughly before you handle the lenses, and keep your lenses clean.\n",
      "Treatment": "Never rub your eye to try to get the object out because this can create a corneal abrasion or deeper injury.\nIf the object is cannot be removed easily or if it is embedded in the eye, cover the eye with gauze and see a doctor immediately.\nIf you wear contact lenses, wash your hands and remove the lenses. It is possible that a small rip in the lens is causing the irritation, rather than a foreign object.\nIf the object is small, such as an eyelash or speck of dirt, you may be able to see it by opening the eye as wide as possible. Have someone look at your eye or, if you are by yourself, look in a mirror. Hold down your lower lid and look up, then lift your upper lid and look down. If you can see the object, you can carefully try to remove it with the edge of a facial tissue or a moistened cotton swab.\nFor small objects you also can try rinsing your eye with clean water. Sometimes your lashes will lift the object out if you pull your upper eyelid over your lower one. If neither of these methods removes the object, try getting someone to help. Lie on your side and hold your eye open with your fingers. Have your friend rinse the eye with an eyedropper or small cup filled with warm water or sterile saline solution.\nIf you cannot remove the object, seek medical care. Your treatment at the doctor's office depends on what the object is, where it is and whether it has damaged your eye. If you have a corneal abrasion, your doctor may give you antibiotics (eye drops or ointment) to prevent infection.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "A puncture wound in the eye is a medical emergency. If you have a foreign object that may be embedded beneath the eye surface, see a physician immediately.\nThe eye is easily damaged, so you should see a doctor if:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on what type of object is in the eye and how it got there. Most corneal abrasions heal within 48 hours. Glass shards, other sharp objects and objects that entered the eye at high speed are more likely to cause damage. An object that penetrates the eye may lead to severe vision loss.\n",

      "What is it?": "A friction blister is a soft pocket of raised skin filled with clear fluid caused by irritation from continuous rubbing or pressure. Friction blisters usually occur on the feet, where tight or poor-fitting shoes can rub and irritate delicate toes and heels for long periods of time. This type of irritation causes minor damage to the skin and the tissue just beneath the skin, then fluid accumulates just beneath the outermost layer of skin. If the irritation is enough to damage small blood vessels, the blister also may contain blood, and is then called a blood blister.\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "A friction blister is a small pocket of puffy, raised skin containing clear fluid. It is usually painful when touched. A blister can appear anywhere.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Blisters can be diagnosed by looking at them. In short, if it looks like a blister and feels like a blister, and if it's in a place that could have been irritated by pressure or rubbing, it likely is a blister.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Friction blisters typically drain on their own within days. A new layer of skin forms beneath the blister, and eventually the blistered skin peels away.\nIf pressure or friction continues in the same area, the blister may last two weeks or longer. Continued friction may rub away the delicate top skin layer, and the blister may break open, ooze fluid and run the risk of becoming infected or developing into a deeper wound. If the irritation is mild, the blister may heal despite continued irritation, and eventually a callus will form.\n",
      "Prevention": "The best way to prevent friction blisters is to wear shoes that fit your feet well, so that the shoe is not tight anywhere and does not slide up and down your heel when you walk. Wear socks with shoes to protect your feet and prevent irritation, and try to keep your feet dry. If another activity is causing blisters — for example, if learning to play golf is causing blisters on your hands — ask an instructor to point out other ways to perform the same activity in a nonirritating way, and take advantage of protective devices, such as gloves.\n",
      "Treatment": "Because blisters typically get better on their own in just a few days, generally no special treatment is required other than to keep the blisters clean and dry. Because the skin provides a natural protection against infection, a blister should be left intact if possible. Do not try to drain the blister or pierce or cut away the overlying skin. Try to avoid further irritation, or protect the blister with a sterile bandage if continued irritation is unavoidable. If the blister breaks on its own, gently wash the area with soap and water and gently pat dry. Try to keep the roof of the blister intact. Cover it with a bandage.\nPeople with diabetes and people who cannot reach blisters easily (because of a physical disability or other ailment) may need to have their blisters evaluated by a foot specialist (podiatrist) or other health care professional. People with diabetes often have nerve or circulation problems that make it more difficult to recognize wounds, and that cause wounds to heal more slowly. In these people, a simple foot blister might go unrecognized and could become infected. People with diabetes need to care for their feet daily and examine them for sores or blisters.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Widespread blistering, itchy blisters or blistering in a place that has not been exposed to rubbing or pressure should be evaluated by a physician. These are signs of an illness, not friction blisters.\nFor typical blisters, medical care is needed only if an infection develops. This is more likely to occur if the skin over the blister has been pierced, broken or popped. These types of blisters need to be watched for a few days to make sure they heal properly. See your doctor immediately if you think you have an infection, see significant redness, notice drainage that is not clear fluid or develop a fever. Also, seek professional help if the blister is so large or painful that walking or other activities become difficult.\nPeople with diabetes who get blisters frequently or have blisters that don't seem to heal should see a health care professional.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most blisters heal on their own in a few days. If there is continued pressure or friction to the area, it may take two weeks or longer for the blister to go away.\n",

      "What is Friedreich's ataxia?": "Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited (genetic) disorder that causes certain nerve cells to deteriorate over time. In many cases, this disorder also affects the heart, certain bones and cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. The illness typically begins with difficulty walking. People with Friedreich's ataxia develop clumsy, shaky movements of the legs (called gait ataxia) during childhood or early adolescence. In rare cases, symptoms appear in infants and in middle-aged adults. As the disease gets worse, people may develop bony deformities of the spine and feet, loss of sensation in the limbs, speech problems, abnormal eye movements, heart disease and diabetes.\nTo continue reading this article, you mustlog in.\nSubscribe to Harvard Health Online for immediate access to health news and information from Harvard Medical School.\nI'd like to receive access to Harvard Health Online for only $4.99 a month.\nAlready a member?Login ».\n",

      "What is it?": "Gallstones are hardened collections of bile and other compounds that often form inside the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pouch that collects bile as that liquid flows from the liver to the intestine through the bile ducts. Bile is a fluid that is made, in part, to help with digestion. The salts in bile make it easier for you to digest fat. Bile also contains additional compounds such as cholesterol and bilirubin (created when old red blood cells are destroyed).\nGallstones form in the gallbladder when cholesterol or bilirubin particles begin to cluster together into a solid lump. The stone grows in size as the bile fluid washes over it, much like a pearl forms inside an oyster.\nMost of the time, gallstones do not cause any symptoms or problems. Small gallstones can leave the gallbladder and its draining ducts, then pass out of the body through the intestines.\nGallstones can cause symptoms if they become caught in the narrow outlet of the gallbladder, or in the ducts that drain the gallbladder. After meals, especially meals high in fat, thin muscles in the wall of the gallbladder squeeze to help release bile into the intestines. If the gallbladder squeezes against a gallstone, or if a gallstone blocks the fluid from draining easily, it can be very painful.\nMore serious problems can develop if a gallstone gets into the drainage-duct system but does not make it all the way through to the intestines. In this case, the stone can cause a blockage with buildup of bile in the gallbladder or liver. If bacteria get into the blocked fluid, it can lead to a very serious infection called cholecystitis. If a gallstone lodges low down in the draining ducts, it can also block drainage of digestive enzymes from the pancreas. This can lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).\nGallstones are very common. They occur in 1 out of 5 women by age 60, and they are half as common in men. Gallstones occur more commonly in older people, in people who are overweight, and in people who lose weight suddenly. They also are more likely to occur in women who have been exposed to extra estrogen over their lifetime by having multiple pregnancies, by taking birth control pills, or by taking hormone replacement after menopause.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Eighty percent of people with gallstones do not have any symptoms and do not need treatment. When gallstones do cause symptoms, you might experience:\nOccasionally, gallstones cause more serious complications, including pancreatitis or infections in the gallbladder or bile ducts. If one of these problems occurs, you may experience fever, more severe abdominal pain, or jaundice (a yellow color of the skin or whites of the eyes).\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Most gallstones do not show up on regular x-rays, but they are seen easily with an ultrasound. Gallstones are very common, but don't cause symptoms in most people. If you have symptoms that aren't very typical for gallstones, even if you are found to have gallstones on an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan, it may be difficult for your doctor to know if the stones are causing your symptoms.\n\nIf a stone is blocking drainage of bile, an ultrasound might show widened bile ducts. Your doctor may also order blood tests and an abdominal CT scan to evaluate injury to the liver and pancreas.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Smaller gallstones sometimes float out of the gallbladder on their own and are eliminated from the body in feces. Gallstone attacks also can calm down on their own if the bothersome stones shift position within the gallbladder. However, the majority of people whose gallstones cause symptoms will require surgery to cure the problem and will continue to have symptoms until the gallbladder is removed. Even when a gallstone attack subsides on its own, the symptoms will return within two years in about two of three untreated people.\n",
      "Prevention": "You are less likely to form gallstones if you avoid becoming overweight. If you are a dieter, try to avoid diets that cause you to lose weight very quickly, such as diets restricted to fewer than 500 calories daily.\nBirth control pills and estrogen can increase the likelihood of gallstones. Consider avoiding these medications if you already have other risk factors for gallstones. Groups at higher than average risk of gallstones include Native Americans, Latinas, people with sickle cell anemia, and women who have had multiple pregnancies.\n",
      "Treatment": "Gallstones require treatment only if they are causing symptoms.\nNearly 90% of patients who want treatment for their gallstones undergo a type of surgery called laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In this procedure, a surgeon uses a small light and camera placed through a small incision into your abdomen. The camera, called a laparoscope, allows the surgeon to see what he or she is doing during the operation by watching a video screen.\nUsing small instruments that are placed through other small incisions, the surgeon is able to remove fluid and stones from the gallbladder to deflate it. The gallbladder then can be removed and pulled out through one of the same small holes. People recover very quickly from laparoscopic surgery because the surgical wounds are very small.\nSome patients need to have their gallbladders removed through a larger incision in a type of surgery called open cholecystectomy. In this surgery, a larger diagonal incision is made above the gallbladder, and the surgeon removes the gallbladder using a direct view instead of a camera.\nIt is also important to know that in about 5% of cases, a surgeon may start a laparoscopic procedure, but choose to change to an open cholecystectomy for technical reasons.\nFor stones that are caught in the common bile duct, an additional treatment is usually required. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure done by a gastroenterology specialist or surgeon to view the opening of the bile duct where it empties into the intestine.\nFor an ERCP, your doctor uses miniature instruments attached to a camera at the end of a flexible tube (an endoscope). The endoscope is inserted into the intestine through the mouth. During ERCP the gastroenterologist can widen the lower part of the duct so that the stones can pass out into the intestine on their own, and when possible tug out the stone.\nFor people who cannot tolerate surgery, an oral medication known as ursodeoxycholic acid (Actigall) may be used to help dissolve stones. This treatment usually requires at least six months before results are seen and is only effective in about half of patients. Once the medication is stopped, gallstones are likely to return.\nTwo other ways to break up gallstones are to use shockwaves (lithotripsy) or to dissolve the stones with solvents injected directly into the gallbladder with a needle. Surgery is strongly preferred over these other treatments because stones are likely to form again if the gallbladder is not removed.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you know that you have gallstones, contact your doctor if you develop\n",
      "Prognosis": "Surgical treatment for gallstones is highly effective. In most patients, symptoms go away completely and stay away. The gallbladder is not a necessary organ, and most people do not notice any digestive changes after it is removed. In a few cases, abdominal pain or diarrhea may develop after the gallbladder is removed, and additional treatment or changes in the diet are needed.\n",

      "What is it?": "Flatulence is the passage of intestinal gas (flatus) through the rectum. Passing gas is normal, and every human being does it at least 14 times a day, consciously or unconsciously. Sometimes flatulence happens more often than expected, and this can become an embarrassing problem. Extreme flatulence can even interfere with a person's ability to work and socialize comfortably with other people.\nMost cases of flatulence are related to factors that can be controlled. This is because intestinal gas usually comes from two sources — swallowed air or the work of intestinal bacteria on undigested food.\nSwallowing air is one cause of flatulence. Although much of this swallowed air is belched upward through the mouth, a small amount passes into the intestines and out through the rectum. People swallow air in many different ways, particularly by:\nBacteria in the intestines also can produce gas when they process foods that pass into the colon without being digested higher up in the digestive tract. Some common examples of foods that tend to cause gas include:\nLess commonly, flatulence can be a side effect of certain medications, especially cholestyramine (Questran), used to treat high cholesterol, or the diet drug orlistat (Xenical). It also can be a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome or giardiasis (a parasitic infection).\n",
      "Symptoms": "Flatulence is the passing of intestinal gas, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Some people who have flatulence also complain of abdominal bloating, but others do not.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Usually a person with flatulence is aware of passing gas. Sometimes, it is more troublesome to other family members or co-workers.\nTo investigate the cause, examine your lifestyle, especially the way you eat your meals:\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long flatulence lasts depends on its cause. If flatulence is related to eating habits or dietary factors, it often goes away quickly once you identify the source of the problem and make the necessary changes in diet or lifestyle.\n",
      "Prevention": "You often can prevent flatulence by modifying your eating habits and diet:\n",
      "Treatment": "You may reduce flatulence by trying:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have flatulence that occurs along with abdominal discomfort, significant bloating or a sudden change in your bowel habits, either constipation or diarrhea. Also, call for advice if your attempts to reduce your flatulence have not worked.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Flatulence often can be controlled with a few minor changes in diet or lifestyle.\n",

You may need a stool test or a breath test to determine whether you have anH. pyloriinfection.\nIn some cases, your doctor may want to inspect your stomach lining directly with a procedure called gastroscopy, in which a flexible, lighted instrument is passed into your stomach.

If symptoms still continue, the doctor will recommend further testing, such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which is an examination of the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and upper intestine.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment to see your doctor if you have symptoms of gastritis that awaken you from sleep, prevent you from eating, or interfere with your work or school performance. Call your doctor if you continue to need over-the-counter medications daily to control your symptoms for two weeks or longer.\nCall your doctor immediately if you have severe abdominal pain, blood in your vomit, or stools that look black and tarry.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Once your doctor identifies the cause of your gastritis and begins treatment, the outlook for a full recovery is very good. However, if your gastritis is related to smoking or alcohol use, you must be willing to change your lifestyle to eliminate these irritants.\n",

      "What is it?": "Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the intestines that causes diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, loss of appetite, and other symptoms of digestive upset. In adults, the two most common causes of gastroenteritis are viral and bacterial infections:\nEach year in the United States, millions of people develop gastroenteritis by eating contaminated food, while millions more suffer from mild bouts of viral gastroenteritis. In otherwise healthy adults, both forms of gastroenteritis tend to be mild and brief, and many episodes are never reported to a doctor. However, in the elderly and people with weakened immune defenses, gastroenteritis sometimes can produce dehydration and other dangerous complications. Even in robust adults, certain types of aggressive bacteria occasionally cause more serious forms of food poisoning that can cause high fever and severe gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloody diarrhea.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In adults, symptoms of gastroenteritis typically include mild diarrhea (fewer than 10 watery stools daily), abdominal pain and cramps, low-grade fever (below 101° Fahrenheit), headache, nausea and sometimes vomiting. In some cases, there can be bloody diarrhea.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask whether you recently have been exposed to anyone who has diarrhea, or whether you have recently eaten at a restaurant or social function where the food was left at room temperature for prolonged periods. If you can remember eating a meal within the last week that smelled or tasted strange, be sure to mention it to your doctor.\nSince gastroenteritis is especially common where sanitation is poor, your doctor also will ask whether you have recently traveled to an underdeveloped country or to any location where the drinking water is not tested routinely. This includes rural streams, lakes or swimming holes in the United States.\nIn most cases, your doctor can diagnose mild gastroenteritis based on your symptoms, your history of exposure to spoiled food, impure water or someone with diarrhea, and the results of your physical examination.\nRarely, special laboratory testing may be needed if you have unusually severe symptoms, such as:\nThis testing usually involves taking one or more stool samples to be tested in a laboratory for the presence of bacteria (especially campylobacter, salmonella, orE. coli), or examined for microscopic parasites.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Most cases of mild, uncomplicated gastroenteritis last one to seven days.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent gastroenteritis, you can:\n",
      "Treatment": "In otherwise healthy adults, most cases of mild gastroenteritis go away within a few days. You can try the following suggestions until your symptoms subside:\nIf you have symptoms of severe gastroenteritis, your doctor may prescribe medications to ease your nausea, vomiting and diarrhea; intravenous fluids for symptoms of severe dehydration; and antibiotics if stool tests confirm that a serious bacterial infection is causing your gastroenteritis.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly if you have symptoms of gastroenteritis together with any of the following:\nAlso, call your doctor promptly if you are taking oral medication for a chronic medical condition and you are either too nauseated to swallow your medicine or have vomited after taking it.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Overall, the outlook is excellent. Almost all adults with mild gastroenteritis recover completely without complications.\n",

      "What is it?": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is commonly called heartburn. This digestive disorder most often causes a burning and sometimes squeezing sensation in the mid-chest.\nIn GERD, acid and digestive enzymes from the stomach flow backward into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. This backward flow of stomach juices is called \"reflux.\" These caustic stomach juices inflame the lining of the esophagus. If GERD is not treated, it can permanently damage the esophagus.\nA muscular ring seals the esophagus from the stomach. This ring is called the esophageal sphincter. Normally, the sphincter opens when you swallow, allowing food into your stomach. The rest of the time, it squeezes tight to prevent food and acid in the stomach from backing up into the esophagus.\nIn most people with GERD, however, the esophageal sphincter does not seal tightly. It remains relaxed between swallows. This allows digestive juices to enter the esophagus and irritate the esophageal lining.\nMany things can weaken or loosen the lower esophageal sphincter. These include\n\nProlonged exposure to acid can cause the esophagus to\n\nLong-term exposure to acid also can lead to a condition called Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus increases the risk of esophageal cancer.\nFor many people with GERD, heartburn is not merely an occasional discomfort. Rather, it is a frequent, even daily, ordeal.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of GERD may include\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you:\nYour doctor also will review your current medications. Some medications can loosen the esophageal sphincter. These include\nPain that feels like heartburn also can be a symptom of coronary artery disease. Your doctor may ask whether you have any symptoms of heart problems. He or she may test for heart problems.\nIf your only complaint is mild heartburn and your physical examination is normal, your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medications. You may not need any special diagnostic testing or prescription treatment.\nIf you have more serious symptoms, or if your heartburn is not relieved by medications, you will need further testing. Serious symptoms include severe, long-lasting heartburn, difficulty swallowing, or weight loss.\nThe best test for GERD is an endoscopy. The doctor looks directly at your esophagus with an endoscope. This is a flexible tube that can be passed through the mouth and throat. Endoscopy usually is done by a gastroenterology specialist.\nDuring endoscopy, your doctor may take a small sample of tissue to be examined in a laboratory. Your doctor also may look at your stomach and first part of the small intestines with the endoscope.\nYou also may have one or more of the following tests:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Without treatment, GERD is typically a long-term problem.\nSymptoms may be relieved within days of treatment. But for many patients, several weeks of treatment are needed before symptoms lessen or resolve.\nTreatment often has to continue for a long period. Even with daily medication, many people with reflux continue to have symptoms.\n",
      "Prevention": "There are a lot of things you can do to prevent the symptoms of GERD. Some simple lifestyle changes include:\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment for most people with GERD includes lifestyle changes as described above and medication. If symptoms persist, surgery or endoscopy treatments are other options.\n",
      "Medications": "There are several medications that can be used to treat GERD. They include:\nAntacids that contain magnesium can cause diarrhea. And antacids that contain aluminum can cause constipation. Your doctor may advise you to alternate antacids to avoid these problems. These medicines work for a short time and they do not heal the inflammation of the esophagus.\nPPIs are very effective. They can be especially helpful in patients who do not respond to H2 blockers and antacids. These drugs are more potent acid-blockers than are H2 blockers, but they take longer to begin their effect.\n",
      "Surgery": "Surgery is an option for people with severe, difficult-to-control GERD symptoms. It may also be considered for people who have complications such as asthma or pneumonia, or scar tissue in the esophagus. Some people who do not want to take medications for a long time may choose surgery.\nSurgery for GERD can be done using camera-guided instruments. This technique is called laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery requires smaller incisions than conventional surgery.\nIn a procedure called Nissen fundoplication, excess stomach tissue is folded around the esophagus and sewn in place. This holds extra pressure around the weakened esophageal sphincter.\nThis operation appears to relieve symptoms about as much as prescription acid-blocking medicines. The success rates of surgery might be lower for people whose symptoms are not relieved by anti-acid medicines. Following surgery, some people have a lasting bothersome side effect. But most people who undergo surgery are very satisfied with the results.\nPotential side effects include swallowing difficulty, diarrhea, and the inability to belch or vomit to relieve bloating or nausea.\n\n",
      "Endoscopy treatments": "The lower esophageal sphincter can sometimes be tightened using an endoscope. The procedures currently used are stitching (plication) and radiofrequency heating (the Stretta procedure). These procedures are newer and long-term success still needs to be determined.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most patients improve after treatment with medication. But it can take weeks of treatment before symptoms begin to improve.\n",

      "What is it?": "Gastrointestinal amebiasis is an infection of the large intestine caused by microscopic one-celled parasites commonly known as amoebas(Entamoeba histolytica).Because these parasites live in the large intestine, they travel in the feces of infected people, and can contaminate water supplies in places where sanitation is poor. The parasite can contaminate fruits and vegetables grown in areas where human feces are used as fertilizer. They can be transferred on the dirty hands of infected people who don't wash their hands often or correctly.\nOnce amoebas enter the mouth, they travel through the digestive system and settle in the large intestine. Harmless strains of the parasite(Entamoeba dispar)live there without causing damage.E. histolyticacan live in the intestine without causing symptoms, but it also can cause severe disease. These amoebas may invade the wall of the intestine, leasing to amoebic dysentery, an illness that causes intestinal ulcers, bleeding, increased mucus production, and diarrhea. These amoebas also may pass into the bloodstream and travel to the liver or, infrequently, to the brain, where they form pockets of infection (abscesses).\nAbout 10% of the world's population is infected with amoebas, particularly people who live in Mexico, India, Central America, South America, Africa, and the tropical areas of Asia. In industrialized countries, amebiasis is most common in recent immigrants and travelers who visit countries where amoebas are prevalent.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In more than 90% of cases, the infecting strain of amoeba does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they usually begin within months after amoebas first enter the body. In some people, the symptoms are mild, consisting of mild pain and gurgling sounds in the lower abdomen, along with two or three loose stools daily. In other people, however, there can be full-blown symptoms of amoebic dysentery, including high fever, severe abdominal pain, and 10 or more episodes of diarrhea daily. Typically, this diarrhea is watery or contains blood and mucus.\nWhen amoebas spread to the liver and cause liver abscess, symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting, pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen, weight loss, and an enlarged liver. It is possible for a person to develop symptoms of an amoebic liver abscess without ever having had the diarrhea typical of infection.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your exposure to amoebas, especially about any recent trips to areas where amoebas are common. Your doctor will look for specific symptoms of amoebic infection, especially frequent diarrhea or loose stools and the presence of blood and mucus in your bowel movements. Because other conditions can cause bloody diarrhea, and because there are other types of infectious diarrhea, information about bowel disease in your family and details of your travels are particularly important.\nSeveral different types of tests are available to diagnose the strain of amoeba and what parts of the body are likely infected. In the past, doctors most often ordered a series of three stool samples to be checked in the laboratory for the presence of the parasite. Today, doctors more often order either an antigen test or a molecular method called PCR on a stool sample to help make a more specific diagnosis ofE. histolytica, the strain that most often requires treatment. Your doctor may also order a blood test in special situations.\nIf the diagnosis is not clear after stool and blood tests, proctosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy may be needed to allow your doctor to examine the intestinal wall directly and to take tissue samples for laboratory examination. In these tests, a doctor inserts a thin, lighted instrument into the rectum and colon to view them directly.\nWhen symptoms of fever and abdominal pain, especially on the right upper side, suggest a possible liver abscess, you may need an ultrasound or CT scan of the liver. Because people who have a liver abscess may no longer have parasites in the intestines, stool tests may be less helpful. In these situations, doctors confirm the diagnosis with a blood test or a needle aspiration or biopsy. In a needle aspiration or biopsy, a small piece of tissue from the abscess is removed and examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Harmless amoebas can live in the intestines for years without causing symptoms. When invasive amoebas cause symptoms of amoebic dysentery, attacks can last from a few days to several weeks. Unless you are treated, you can have another attack.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no immunization to protect against gastrointestinal amebiasis. If you travel to areas where amebiasis is common, you can decrease your risk of infection by drinking only canned or bottled drinks or water that has been boiled. Eat only foods that have been cooked thoroughly. Drink only pasteurized milk and dairy products. If you eat raw fruit, eat only those that you have freshly peeled.\n",
      "Treatment": "Gastrointestinal amebiasis is treated with nitroimidazole drugs, which kill amoebas in the blood, in the wall of the intestine, and in liver abscesses. These drugs include metronidazole (Flagyl) and tinidazole (Tindamax, Fasigyn). Metronidazole usually is given for 10 days, either by mouth or directly into the veins (intravenously). To kill amoebas and cysts confined to the intestine, three drugs called luminal drugs are available: iodoquinol (Diquinol and others), paromomycin (Humatin) and diloxanide furoate (Furamide). One of these drugs is used along with metronidazole when gastrointestinal symptoms are present. In people who pass amoebas in their stools without having symptoms of amebiasis, the luminal drugs alone can clear the amoebas from the bowel.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have continuing diarrhea, especially if it contains blood and mucus. If you have severe abdominal pain, especially in the right upper side, and a fever, visit a doctor the same day. When you have non-bloody diarrhea that is frequent and symptoms of dehydration such as dizziness, call your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Drug treatment can cure amebiasis within a few weeks. However, because medication cannot keep you from getting infected again, repeat episodes of amebiasis may occur if you continue to live in or travel to areas where amoebas are found. Among children in developing countries, especially infants and those younger than 5, gastrointestinal amebiasis can be fatal. Worldwide, amebiasis is the third most common cause of death from parasitic infections.\n",

      "What Is It?": "In generalized anxiety disorder, a person has frequent or nearly constant, nagging feelings of worry or anxiety. These feelings are either unusually intense or out of proportion to the real troubles and dangers of the person's everyday life.\nThe disorder is defined as persistent worry for more days than not, for at least several months. In some cases, a person with generalized anxiety disorder feels he or she has always been a worrier, even since childhood or adolescence. In other cases, the anxiety may be triggered by a crisis or a period of stress, such as a job loss, a family illness or the death of a relative. The crisis or stress may have ended, but an unexplained feeling of anxiety may last months or years.\nIn addition to suffering from constant (or non-stop) worries and anxieties, people with generalized anxiety disorder may have low self-esteem or feel insecure. They may see people's intentions or events in negative terms, or they experience them as intimidating or critical. Physical symptoms may lead them to seek treatment from a primary care doctor, cardiologist, pulmonary specialist or gastroenterologist. Stress can intensify the anxiety.\nSome people with this disorder have a genetic (inherited) tendency to develop it. The disorder probably stems from how a variety of brain structures communicate with each other as the individual tries to manage the fear response. Life experience, significant relationships and environmental stresses also influence the development of this disorder.\nAbout 3% to 8% of people in the United States have generalized anxiety disorder. Women have the problem twice as often as men. The average adult patient first seeks professional help between the ages of 20 and 30. However, the illness can occur at any age. Generalized anxiety disorder also has been diagnosed in young children, teenagers and elderly people. The illness is the most common anxiety disorder affecting people age 65 and older.\nOf all psychiatric illnesses, generalized anxiety disorder is the least likely to occur alone. Between 50% and 90% of people with the disorder also have at least one other problem, usually panic disorder, a phobia, depression, alcoholism or some other form of substance abuse.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In generalized anxiety disorder, the person has persistent worry or anxiety that lasts for at least several months. (The diagnostic manual in psychiatry sets the minimum to 6 months, but you don't need to use a precise timer to seek help.)\nWorry or anxiety is excessive, troubling and hard to control. It often interferes with the ability to function at home, at work or in social situations.\nFeeling restless or keyed up Here are some of the other defining symptoms or behaviors common in the disorder:\nPeople with generalized anxiety disorder also may have physical symptoms that feel like symptoms of heart disease, respiratory illness, digestive diseases and other medical illnesses.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "You may consult a primary care doctor first if you suspect your physical symptoms are part of a medical illness. Your doctor may do tests to check for medical problems. If the results are normal, your doctor may ask about your family history, your history of any mental distress, current anxieties, recent stresses, and daily use of prescription and nonprescription drugs. Some drugs can cause anxiety symptoms. The doctor then may refer you to a psychiatrist for care.\nA psychiatrist will diagnose generalized anxiety disorder based on a full psychiatric evaluation that includes:\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Although the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder may be made after several months of symptoms, the condition can last years, especially without treatment. Many people experience the symptoms as part of a lifelong pattern.\n",
      "Prevention": "Since stress is a normal part of life, there is usually no way to prevent generalized anxiety disorder in someone who is vulnerable. However, once diagnosed, various treatments can effectively reduce symptoms.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have generalized anxiety disorder, the most effective treatment is usually a combination of medications and psychotherapy. Research shows that using both has a more lasting positive effect than either one alone. Your doctor may also offer treatment for other conditions that may be making matters worse, such as a medical problem or depression.\nYou may need to try more than one approach before you find the right one. Many different kinds of medications can relieve anxiety. Here are the most common categories prescribed:\nAntidepressants— Despite their name, many of these drugs are very effective for anxiety. They are used very commonly to treat generalized anxiety disorder.\nThe popular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft) and escitalopram (Lexapro) are often the first choice. Antidepressants that have a different mechanism of action work too. Examples are mirtazapine (Remeron), venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta). Older antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants (for example, nortriptyline, imipramine) are also effective, but can have more troublesome side effects.\nSince antidepressants often take several weeks to work, your doctor may also prescribe a fast-acting benzodiazepine for relief.\nBenzodiazepines— These drugs affect a chemical messenger that works in the brain's fear response system. Examples of benzodiazepines are clonazepam (Klonopin), lorazepam (Ativan), diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax). They can bring quick relief from symptoms of anxiety. Since they act immediately, they may be prescribed during the first weeks of treatment while waiting for an antidepressant medication to take hold.\nThese drugs are prescribed for a relatively short time because of the concern about dependency. Also the body can become accustomed to the effect. That is, benzodiazepines may provide less relief as time goes on. If you need to stop taking these drugs, do so gradually under a doctor's direction, because withdrawal reactions can occur.\nBuspirone (BuSpar)— Buspirone is an antianxiety drug that can be effective for generalized anxiety disorder. However, it is used much less frequently than the drugs listed above. Like antidepressants, it usually takes two to three weeks to begin working.\n",
      "Psychotherapy": "A number of psychotherapy techniques may be helpful. Here are some examples:\nYour therapist may combine any of the above approaches or may discuss others — for example, meditation, hypnosis or exercise — with you so that the approach fits your specific problems and needs.\n",

      "What is a generalized seizure?": "Normally, the brain's nerve cells (neurons) communicate with one another by firing tiny electric signals that pass from cell to cell. The firing pattern of these electric signals reflects how busy the brain is. The location of these signals indicates what the brain is doing, such as thinking, seeing, feeling, hearing, controlling the movement of muscles, etc. A seizure occurs when the firing pattern of the brain's electric signals suddenly becomes very abnormal and unusually intense, either in an isolated area of the brain or throughout the brain.\nIf the whole brain is involved, the electrical disturbance is called a generalized seizure. This type of seizure used to be called a grand mal seizure. The most easily recognizable symptom of a generalized seizure is the body stiffness and jerking limbs known as tonic-clonic motor activity.\nEpilepsy is the condition of being prone to repeated seizures, but this can be any kind of seizure, not just generalized seizures. A person can have a seizure without having epilepsy. Today, seizure disorder is the term used more commonly than epilepsy.\nA seizure can be provoked by any situation that seriously disturbs the physical or chemical environment of the brain. Some common triggers include:\nIf doctors can successfully treat the physical or chemical disturbance in the brain, the seizure problem often goes away. If not, seizures may return again and again, whenever the underlying problem flares up.\nSometimes, a person will experience an unprovoked generalized seizure, one that occurs for no apparent reason. In some people, this type of seizure may be related to a genetic (inherited) vulnerability that makes the brain cells unusually sensitive to minor changes in the environment. In other cases, seizures may be related to scarring caused by prior head trauma or by a previous stroke, brain tumor or brain infection.\nMany people who have one unprovoked seizure never experience a second one. However, if a second seizure occurs, the risk of having a third or even more is about 80 percent. For this reason, doctors often regard the second seizure as a sign of epilepsy.\n",
      "Symptoms of generalized seizures": "A seizure begins suddenly. Without warning, the person loses consciousness and experiences the following symptoms:\nThe seizure usually subsides within two minutes or less, leaving the person confused and sleepy. Over the following 24 hours, he or she may complain of sore muscles, headache, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.\n",
      "Diagnosing generalized seizures": "If you have had symptoms of a seizure, your doctor will begin by looking for an underlying medical trigger, such as low blood sugar or eclampsia. If your doctor can confirm a definite medical reason for your seizure, your treatment will be geared toward correcting the underlying illness.\nIf your seizure appears to be unprovoked (not triggered by any underlying medical problem), your doctor will review your medical history, family history, and any eyewitness reports of your seizure symptoms. Next, the doctor will do a thorough physical and neurological examination and order routine blood tests. In most cases, the results of your examinations and blood tests will be normal.\nYour doctor also may order an electroencephalogram (EEG), a painless test that detects the electrical activity in your brain and translates it into a series of printed patterns. In 40% to 50% of people with epilepsy, the first EEG will show a specific combination of patterns that confirms the diagnosis. If the first EEG is normal, repeat EEG tests usually will detect the abnormal brain-wave pattern.\nSometimes, even when a series of EEG tests fails to show evidence of seizure activity, the diagnosis can be based on evidence from the reports of people who have seen your seizure episodes.\nIn some cases, the doctor may also order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan of your brain to look for evidence of a local problem, such as a brain tumor or scarring from a previous brain injury. These scans are especially important if:\n",
      "Expected duration of generalized seizures": "About half of all people who have one unprovoked seizure never have another.\nMost people who have epilepsy can avoid seizures if they get enough sleep and take prescribed medications as directed. Most people with epilepsy need to take medication indefinitely. Never stop medication without specific instructions from your physician.\nIf you have had only a couple of seizures and have a normal EEG, your doctor might reevaluate the need for medication if you have no seizures after two to five years.\n",
      "Preventing generalized seizure": "Most of the time epilepsy cannot be prevented. But whether or not you have epilepsy, you can help prevent a generalized seizure by observing the following:\n",
      "Treating generalized seizure": "If you have had only one unprovoked seizure, you may not have another. For this reason, your doctor may decide to monitor your condition without prescribing medication. In most cases, you will be considered to have a low risk of a second seizure if you have no history of brain injury (tumor, trauma, infections), no family history of epilepsy and normal results on diagnostic tests, including an EEG.\nIf you have had at least two seizure episodes and have been diagnosed with epilepsy, your doctor will treat you with an anti-epileptic medication (an anticonvulsant). Common anti-epileptic medications used to treat generalized seizures include valproate (Depakote), levetiracetam (Keppra), carbamazepine (Tegretol), phenytoin (Dilantin), topiramate (Topamax) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). If your seizures cannot be controlled with one drug alone, your doctor will try a combination of two drugs.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you or anyone in your family experiences a series of symptoms that appear to be a generalized seizure. If you already have been diagnosed with epilepsy, call your doctor if you continue to have seizures even though you are taking anti-epileptic medication.\nIf you witness someone having a generalized seizure that lasts for more than five minutes, call for emergency medical help immediately. Also call for emergency medical help immediately if you witness someone having a generalized seizure who:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many factors play a role in determining whether a person with generalized epilepsy eventually becomes seizure-free. Overall, the outlook is best in those who have had very few seizures before beginning treatment, have good seizure control with only one anti-epileptic drug, have a normal EEG between seizures, have no history of brain damage, and have a normal neurological exam at the end of treatment.\nIn many cases, the outlook is very good. With proper treatment, up to 70 percent of people with epilepsy ultimately become seizure-free for five or more years.\nMost children with generalized seizures can lead normal lives, including participating in organized sports, with minimal restrictions.\n",

      "What is it?": "Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause blisters and skin ulcers in the genital and anal area. It can be caused by either of two types of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 or HSV-2. HSV-2 is the more common cause. HSV-1 more commonly causes sores on the face and mouth.\nHSV spreads from person to person through kissing and skin-to-skin contact, as well as through vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse. An infected person often transmits the virus when skin blisters or ulcers are visible, but the virus also can be spread when there are no symptoms or skin sores at all. Herpes virus can be transmitted by people who don't know they are infected.\nIn a pregnant woman with HSV infection (usually HSV-2), the virus can pass to the baby during delivery, causing infections of the newborn's skin, mouth, lungs, or eyes. If the herpes virus spreads through the baby's bloodstream, it can cause serious infections of the brain and other vital organs.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Many people with genital herpes infection have no symptoms. When symptoms appear, they can include\nLess common problems related to genital herpes include\nThe first episode of herpes symptoms usually has the worst symptoms. When symptoms develop, they can occur from a few days to a few weeks after contact with an infected person, but sometimes an infected person might not have any symptoms for years. Almost everyone with symptomatic genital herpes will have at least one recurrence. In people who have repeated herpes episodes, symptoms can be triggered by physical or emotional stress.\nNewborns infected with herpes around the time of delivery usually develop symptoms five to nine days after birth. Symptoms can include blisters on the skin, eyes, and mouth. If the virus spreads through the baby's bloodstream to the brain, there can be sleepiness or irritability, and seizures. The virus can also spread to the baby's liver, lungs, and other organs, causing disseminated (widespread) disease. Herpes in a newborn can be from either HSV-1 or HSV-2, but HSV-2 tends to cause more severe disease.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may suspect that you have genital herpes based on your sexual history, your symptoms, and the results of your physical examination. Your doctor may want to confirm the diagnosis by scraping the affected skin area for laboratory testing. He or she may also want to do a blood test to confirm the diagnosis.\nPeople who have one type of sexually transmitted infection are at risk of others. Your doctor may wish to test you for other infections, such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nThe diagnosis of herpes infection in the newborn can be difficult because other things can cause similar symptoms in babies, including other types of infections. Special cultures and blood tests similar to those used in adults help confirm the diagnosis in newborns.\n",
      "Expected duration": "There is no cure for genital herpes. Herpes infection remains persistent, but it can be dormant (asleep) for very long periods of time. The symptoms tend to return periodically. The pattern of recurrence (how frequently it happens, how long an episode lasts, and what the symptoms are) is different for every person.\n",
      "Prevention": "To avoid getting herpes, you should always follow safer sexual practices. Limit your number of sexual partners. Always use condoms unless you are in a monogamous relationship with an uninfected person.\nPeople with genital herpes should abstain from sexual activity when they have symptoms. They also should tell all sex partners about their herpes infection and use condoms during sexual activity. Even without symptoms, a person can shed the herpes virus and infect others.\nThere is some evidence that people who are infected with genital herpes can reduce the frequency and severity of recurrences and reduce the risk of transmitting the infection to sexual partners by taking antiviral medication every day (see Treatment, below).\nPeople with active genital herpes sores are more likely to become infected with HIV if they are exposed through sexual intercourse. If you have HIV and you are infected with HSV-2, you may be more likely to spread HIV to others.\nPregnant women who have visible ulcers from genital herpes at the time of delivery usually are encouraged to have a Caesarean section to prevent HSV from spreading to the newborn. Because the decision to have a Caesarean section is based on many factors, a pregnant woman with HSV infection should discuss the subject with her physician as early as possible in her pregnancy. Women with their first outbreak at the time of delivery have the highest risk of transmitting the virus to the baby. Women known to have herpes before delivery may be counseled to take antivirals for the last few weeks of their pregnancy, but this decision should be made on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "Treatment": "Episodes of genital herpes can be treated with oral antiviral medications, including valacyclovir (Valtrex), famciclovir (Famvir) and acyclovir (Zovirax). Acyclovir also comes in a cream for application to the skin. The cream is not very effective, and generally is not recommended.\nFor severe herpes virus infections, people are treated with intravenous (IV) acyclovir.\nAlthough these antiviral medications cannot cure the herpes infection, they can reduce the severity and shorten the duration of symptoms. The initial genital herpes outbreak should be treated as soon as possible. Ideally an antiviral should begin within three days of when symptoms start.\nFor recurrences, an antiviral medication can be started at soon as symptoms are noticed to make the outbreak less severe. People with severe or frequent recurrences should consider taking an antiviral medication daily. Daily use of antiviral medications can reduce the severity and frequency of recurrences. Daily antivirals might also help prevent transmission of herpes virus to sexual partners.\nThe decision about whether to treat a pregnant woman known to have herpes with antivirals during the weeks before delivery should be made on a case-by-case basis together with an obstetrician. If a newborn baby is infected with herpes, the infection is treated with an antiviral medication given intravenously.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have any blisters or sores in your genital area, especially if you are pregnant, have frequent bouts of symptoms, or want to know how to best protect your sexual partner from getting infected.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although there is no cure for genital herpes, the frequency and severity of recurrences often decreases with time. Daily oral antiviral medication also can decrease the number and severity of recurrences.\nFor babies with disseminated herpes infection (the most severe type), early treatment with antivirals improves the chance of survival and helps decrease the risk of long-lasting complications.\n",

      "What are genital warts?": "Genital warts are warts that form on the skin of the genital area. They are caused by certain subtypes of the human papillomavirus (HPV), the same virus that causes warts on other areas of the body. Genital warts are spread through sexual intercourse, so they are classified as a sexually transmitted infection, and can affect both men and women. Genital warts also are known as condyloma acuminata or venereal warts. They can develop anywhere near the vagina, cervix, genitals, or rectum.\nBecause genital warts can take six months to develop, you can have the infection without having any symptoms. Human papillomavirus also causes virtually all cases of cervical cancer worldwide. The subtypes that are most likely to cause cancer are different from those that usually cause warts. However, many people are infected with more than one subtype. Therefore, people with genital warts are more likely to be infected with a cancer-causing virus as well.\n",
      "Symptoms of genital warts": "Genital warts appear on moist surfaces, especially at the entrance of the vagina and rectum in women. In men and women, they can appear anywhere in the genital or anal area. They may be small, flat, flesh-colored bumps or tiny, cauliflower-like bumps. Individual warts usually measure 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter — much smaller than the diameter of a pencil eraser — but clusters can be quite large. In some cases, warts can be so small that you can't see them. Genital warts may not cause any symptoms, or they may cause itching, burning, tenderness or pain.\n",
      "Diagnosing genital warts": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history and about your sexual habits and any prior episodes of sexual transmitted infections. Your doctor will then examine you to look for evidence of genital warts. Their appearance is very characteristic, and most often the diagnosis does not require further testing. If necessary, a vinegar-like solution placed on the skin turns the warts white and makes diagnosis easier.\nOther diagnostic tests may include:\nAll sex partners also should be examined for the infection.\n",
      "Expected duration of genital warts": "Genital warts may go away on their own or with treatment, or they may last for years. It is common for genital warts to return after they are removed.\n",
      "Preventing genital warts": "The best way to prevent genital warts is to avoid sex or have sex with only one uninfected partner. Using condoms also may help to prevent infection. However, condoms can't always cover all affected skin. Factors that increase your risk of becoming infected include:\nIf you have had genital warts, you should be tested for cervical cancer at least once every year. Cervical cancer can be prevented with regular screening (Pap smears), and can be cured in most cases when it is detected in early stages.\nHPV vaccines help prevent genital warts in addition to decreasing the risk of cervical and anal cancer. The vaccines are given as a set of three shots over six months. The vaccine will not cure existing infections.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all 11- and 12-year-old girls get the shots, although girls as young as 9 could receive it. For catch-up, the CDC also recommends that teens and young women be vaccinated against HPV.\nThe vaccine works best before an individual has been exposed to HPV. Early vaccination provides the greatest chance of preventing cervical cancer and genital warts. Older girls and young women were included in the CDC recommendations because even if they've had some exposure to HPV, it may not be to the strains contained in the vaccine, so they will likely still get some protection.\nThe CDC recommends the HPV vaccine for boys ages 11 or 12 years, older boys, and young men if they have not previously had the shots.\n",
      "Treating genital warts": "Treatment depends on the size and location of the warts. Even though the warts may be removed, there may still be some virus remaining in the skin, which is why the warts often return. Some of the medications used to treat genital warts cannot be used during pregnancy, so it's important to tell your doctor if you could be pregnant.\nSmall warts may be treated with medications applied to the skin. In some cases, applying liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy) to warts will freeze the tissue and make warts disappear. Some larger warts require laser treatment, or surgical removal.\nDo not treat genital warts yourself with nonprescription drugs used for wart removal on hands, because these chemicals can make the genital area very sore.\nYour doctor may prescribe a medication that you can apply to the warts at home. Apply this medication carefully to avoid damaging surrounding healthy tissue, keep it out of your eyes, and wash it off after the number of hours your doctor instructs you to leave it on. Your doctor also may suggest that you apply a protective coating of petroleum jelly on delicate surrounding tissue before you apply your prescribed medication.\nYou will be told to avoid sexual relations until treatment is completed.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your physician if you notice warts or bumps on your genital area, or if you have itching, burning, tenderness, or pain in that area. Call your doctor immediately if you develop signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or muscle aches.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Genital warts may go away on their own or with treatment. It is common for them to return. Certain strains of the virus (HPV), which causes genital warts, cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer worldwide, though only a small percentage of the women who become infected will develop cancer. Cervical cancer develops slowly over decades. If you have genital warts, it is possible that you have also been infected with a cancer-causing strain of the virus. You should be sure to get Pap smears regularly.\n",

      "What is it?": "Gestational diabetes is the appearance of higher-than-expected blood sugars during pregnancy. Once it occurs, it lasts throughout the remainder of the pregnancy. It affects up to 14 percent of all pregnant women in the United States. It is more common in African-American, Latino, Native American and Asian women compared with Caucasians.\nLike the other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes results when sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream can't be moved efficiently into body cells such as muscle cells that normally use sugar as a body fuel. The hormone insulin helps to move sugar from the bloodstream into the cells. In gestational diabetes, the body does not respond well to insulin, unless insulin can be produced or provided in larger amounts. In most women, the disorder goes away when the pregnancy ends, but women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\nDiabetes occurs during pregnancy because hormones produced in a pregnancy make the body resistant to insulin's effects. These hormones include growth hormone and human placental lactogen. Both of these hormones are essential to a healthy pregnancy and fetus, but they partially block the action of insulin. In most women, the pancreas reacts to this situation by producing enough additional insulin to overcome the insulin resistance. In women with gestational diabetes, not enough extra insulin is produced, so sugar accumulates in the bloodstream.\nAs the fetus grows larger, larger quantities of the hormones are produced. Because it is the time when these hormone levels are highest, gestational diabetes usually starts in the last trimester of pregnancy. After delivery, the body's hormones quickly return to non-pregnant levels. Typically, the amount of insulin that is made by the pancreas is adequate for your needs once again, and blood glucose levels return to normal.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Some pregnant women with gestational diabetes have the symptoms of diabetes that are associated with high blood glucose (hyperglycemia). These include:\nHowever, some women have no recognizable symptoms. This is why screening tests for this disease are recommended for all pregnant women.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Gestational diabetes usually is diagnosed during the routine testing that occurs as a part of complete prenatal care. In a normal pregnancy, blood sugars are about 20% lower than is seen in women who aren't pregnant because the developing fetus absorbs some glucose from the mother's blood. Diabetes is evident if blood sugar levels are higher than expected for pregnancy. In order to find gestational diabetes in its earliest form, doctors usually give the pregnant woman a heavily sugared drink prior to testing the blood so that the body's sugar-processing capability is maximally challenged. This is known as an oral glucose tolerance test.\nIt is appropriate for a woman who is overweight, has a family history of diabetes, or has symptoms suggesting diabetes to undergo testing at the first prenatal visit. All other women should be tested after 24 weeks of gestation. Most often the testing is done between 24 and 28 weeks.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Diabetes that appears during a pregnancy usually goes away after the pregnancy is over. However, the fact that your pancreas can't keep up with insulin demands during pregnancy shows that it is operating without much reserve even when you are not pregnant. Women who have gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Twenty percent of women with gestational diabetes have elevated blood sugar levels that continue for a few weeks after they give birth. These women are the most likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life.\n",
      "Prevention": "Gestational diabetes usually cannot be prevented. However, careful control of your weight before pregnancy may reduce your risk. Very low-calorie diets are not recommended during pregnancy because adequate nutrition is important.\nComplications of gestational diabetes can be prevented by carefully controlling your blood sugar and by being monitored by an obstetrician throughout your pregnancy.\nAfter your pregnancy, you can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet have been shown to lower the risk of diabetes in people who are at high risk for diabetes. The medicine metformin (Glucophage) can help to prevent diabetes in people who have mildly elevated blood glucose levels outside of pregnancy, but who do not have levels high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes.\n",
      "Treatment": "Some pregnant women are able to keep blood glucose at healthy levels by managing their diet. This requires consultation with a dietitian to set up a diet plan, and regular monitoring of blood glucose.\nIf diet does not control blood glucose adequately, your doctor will prescribe medication, either as pills to take by mouth or insulin injections. In the past, insulin was always preferred. But today studies show successful blood sugar control can sometimes be done with oral medication, such as metformin or glyburide.\nGestational diabetes creates dangers for the developing fetus. Unlike type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes rarely causes serious birth defects. However, in gestational diabetes the baby can have complications during delivery because it may be larger than normal (a large body size for a baby is called macrosomia). Large baby body size comes from the extra sugar exposure. If the diabetes is not treated carefully, high blood sugar levels can increase the chance of fetal death prior to delivery (stillbirth).\nDelivery itself may be more difficult, and the need for Caesarean delivery is more frequent. If natural labor and delivery has not occurred by 38 weeks of pregnancy, your doctor probably may recommend inducing labor or delivering by surgery to avoid macrosomia.\nComplications also can affect the baby right after birth. Prior to delivery, the fetus's pancreas gets used to making a large amount of insulin each day, to help manage the fetus's exposure to high blood sugar levels. After delivery, it takes time for the baby's pancreas to adjust.\nIf the baby makes too much insulin during its first hours after birth, low blood sugar may occur temporarily. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby's blood sugar should be measured after birth. If necessary, intravenous glucose will be given to the baby. Other chemical imbalances also may occur temporarily, so the baby's calcium and blood count also should be monitored.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "All pregnant women should receive prenatal care and have regular visits with a qualified physician or midwife. Most women should receive an oral glucose challenge test during weeks 24 to 28 of their pregnancies, and women at high risk of diabetes should get tested earlier.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most of the time, gestational diabetes is a short-term condition. In more than three-quarters of women who develop gestational diabetes, blood glucose levels go back to normal once the pregnancy ends. However, the pancreas has demonstrated that it is operating without much reserve. Women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing it again in subsequent pregnancies. They are also at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life and should have their blood glucose checked regularly even after the pregnancy is over.\n",

      "What is it?": "Giant cell arteritis, also called temporal arteritis, is a disease in which the large arteries and their branches, including those that supply the eye, scalp, and face, become inflamed and narrowed. This disease can cause loss of vision, so it is essential that the problem be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Larger blood vessels, including the aorta and its branches, also may be involved, and can lead to the blood vessel weakening and even rupturing years later.\n\nThis disorder develops almost exclusively in people older than age 55 and most commonly affects people in their 70s and 80s. It is relatively rare: among people over the age of 55, it affects an estimated two people in 1,000.\nThe cause of giant cell arteritis is unknown, although there has been speculation that in some people, the body's immune system responds incorrectly to an infection, and begins to attack the lining of blood vessels as it would a foreign invader. There may be a genetic contribution as well, as suggested by occasional cases that affect more than one member of the same family. One possibility is that the immune system of certain individuals or family members may be genetically programmed to respond to an infection abnormally, a response that leads to giant cell arteritis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The most common symptom is a dull, throbbing headache, often at one or both sides of the forehead, although it can be anywhere over the head or into the neck. Other common symptoms include one or more of the following:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may suspect you have this disorder if you are an older adult with a new headache. He or she will begin by asking you for a detailed description of your symptoms, past medical problems, and medications. Next, the doctor will examine you, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries, located just in front of the ear, above the jaw, and other blood vessels.\nYour doctor will consider other causes of headache or other symptoms and may order tests to check for these conditions. However, if giant cell arteritis is still a strong concern after these tests, blood tests to detect inflammation, called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP), may be ordered because they tend to be elevated in this condition.\nA biopsy of the temporal artery generally is required to confirm the diagnosis. In this procedure, a small piece of the blood vessel will be removed under local anesthesia and will be examined in a laboratory. New research suggests that other tests, including ultrasound of the temporal arteries, may be useful for the detection of this condition, but a biopsy is still considered the best available test.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Giant cell arteritis typically lasts at least several years. However, improvement usually begins within days of starting therapy. Some people are able to discontinue treatment within six months, but longer treatment over two to three years is more usual. Occasionally, the disease returns after it has gone away for a prolonged period.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent this disease. Vision loss (and, perhaps, other complications) may be prevented by prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n",
      "Treatment": "Giant cell arteritis is a serious disease that requires prompt medical attention since delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to vision loss or other complications. The main treatment is high doses of prednisone, a corticosteroid, and most people feel better within a few days. Medication is continued at a high dose for approximately one month and then tapered gradually over the following months to the lowest possible dose, or is discontinued.\nIt is common for people with this disorder to require at least six months of therapy. Treatment is typically continued for a year or more because many people experience symptoms typical of polymyalgia rheumatica (aching in the shoulders, hips, or both) or recurrent headaches as the prednisone dose is reduced.\nIn 2017, tocilizumab (Actemra) was approved for the treatment of giant cell arteritis as studies demonstrated that, along with corticosteroids, it was effective for this condition, including a steroid-sparing effect. This medication may be recommended if symptoms repeatedly return as the steroids are reduced, or if there are other conditions for which steroid therapy may be particularly troublesome (including diabetes or osteoporosis).\nSome studies have found that another medication, methotrexate (Folex, Rheumatrex), may reduce the dose of corticosteroids required and the length of time they need to be taken, although other studies have not confirmed this. As a result, some physicians prescribe methotrexate as a \"steroid-sparing\" agent in the hopes of reducing the overall exposure to corticosteroids.  However, the evidence to date suggests that tocilizumab is more effective than methotrexate as a steroid-sparing drug.\nThe use of steroids can lead to complications, including osteoporosis, diabetes, and weight gain; measures to prevent these complications (such as supplemental calcium and vitamin D) are routinely recommended. Bone density testing is also recommended to monitor bone density and identify osteoporosis. Research is ongoing to identify other effective steroid-sparing medications.\nSome research suggests that low-dose aspirin may help to prevent complications of giant cell arteritis, including loss of vision. While the true impact of aspirin is uncertain, it is often recommended along with steroid therapy for this condition.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have any symptoms of giant cell arteritis, especially a new headache, unexplained fever, or visual symptoms, you should contact your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If vision has not been affected, the outlook is excellent. However, once vision loss occurs, it is usually permanent. If the aorta or nearby branches are involved, the prognosis may be worse, because these blood vessels may enlarge or even rupture. However, most complications related to giant cell arteritis are caused by steroid therapy rather the disease itself.\n",

      "What is giardiasis?": "Giardiasis is an intestinal illness caused by infection with the parasiteGiardia lamblia, which lives in contaminated water. Although the illness most often occurs in developing countries, giardiasis is also a common cause of waterborne illness in the United States. A person can remain infected withGiardiauntil the infection is diagnosed and treated.\nIn developing areas of the world, it is common for more than 20% of a country's population to have ongoingGiardiainfection. In the United States, only one or two out of every 10,000 people haveGiardiain a typical year, but the infection is found in about one out of three people who have prolonged diarrhea symptoms if they have recently traveled to a developing country.\nAs one part of their life cycle,G. lambliaparasites change into cysts. Contagious cysts are found in the feces of infected people or animals. You can become infected withG. lambliaby:\nG. lambliacan survive in cold, chlorinated water for up to two months, and outbreaks have occurred in municipal water supplies.\nPeople at greatest risk of giardiasis include:\nChildren are three times more likely to develop giardiasis than adults. It is possible that the human body develops some immunity to the parasite over time.\n",
      "Symptoms of giardiasis": "Up to two-thirds of people infected with the organism do not have any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can appear suddenly and be obvious or they may worsen slowly. Typically, symptoms start one to three weeks after exposure and include:\nSome of the symptoms can take several months or more to begin because they are caused by gradual changes in the lining of your intestine.G. lambliainterferes with the body's ability to absorb fats, so your stools may have more fat in them during aGiardiainfection. This is why your stools may float and smell foul.\n",
      "Diagnosing giardiasis": "Your doctor will ask you about your travel history, whether you might have had contact with contaminated water during camping or hiking, and whether your home has well water. If the patient is a child who attends day care, the doctor will ask about any recent outbreaks of diarrhea at the day care center. He or she also will review the patient's symptoms.\nThe diagnosis is made by testing the stool forGiardiaantigen, a protein that is made byG. lambliaparasites, or by identifyingG. lambliacysts or parasites in stool samples. Multiple stool samples may need to be collected since the infection can only be detected in a portion of collected stool samples, even if infection is present.\nInfrequently, diagnosis may require an inspection of the intestine with a procedure called endoscopy. In this procedure, an instrument called an endoscope is inserted through your mouth into your intestine. An endoscope is a narrow, flexible, cord-shaped instrument that is equipped with a camera. If necessary, your doctor can use the endoscope to take a small piece of tissue from your small intestine (a biopsy) to be examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration of giardiasis": "The worst symptoms of giardiasis typically last for five to seven days, as long as diagnosis and treatment is not delayed. Symptoms can take as long as several months to completely go away after treatment because the intestine needs to repair itself. It is common to be intolerant to milk and other dairy products that contain lactose for the first few months after aGiardiainfection. In some people who are not treated, the infection can cause repeated bouts of abdominal pain and diarrhea for a year or longer.\n",
      "Preventing giardiasis": "There is no vaccine that can prevent giardiasis. Medicine to prevent infection is not recommended. The best way to prevent infection is good travel habits and good sanitation.\nTravelers should take special care to avoid food and water that could be contaminated. It is safest to eat produce that has been peeled or cooked. Cooking killsGiardiaparasites and cysts.\nTo prevent giardiasis caused by contaminated water, drink water only from approved sources. When camping and when traveling to developing countries, drink bottled water or other beverages that have been bottled or canned. Campers can drink bottled water, treat water with iodine for eight or more hours, use a high-quality water filter or boil water for at least one minute. Travelers to developing countries should avoid drinking beverages that are served with ice.\nIt is always a good habit to wash your hands frequently. This can reduce your risk ofGiardiainfection at home and while traveling. It is especially important to wash your hands after you use the bathroom, before you eat, after you change a diaper and after you care for a sick person or animal.\n",
      "Treating giardiasis": "If you don't receive treatment for aGiardiainfection, you will probably eventually recover on your own. However, treatment is a good idea for anyone who is having symptoms. Treatment can also help if you don't have symptoms because treatment can prevent the spread of infection to others. This is especially true for children and for people who prepare or serve food.\nCommonly prescribed medications used to treatGiardiainfection include tinidazole (Tindamax), nitazoxanide (Alinia), and metronidazole (Flagyl).\nA doctor should examine and consider treatment for sexual partners and people who have had close contact with the infected person, such as household members, even if they have no symptoms. Pregnant women generally are not treated with medications during the first trimester.\nIf you have giardiasis, be sure to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Over-the-counter medications for diarrhea, such as loperamide (Imodium), may help your symptoms. Wash your hands frequently if you have giardiasis or if you are caring for a person or animal with this infection.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you get diarrhea, especially if this diarrhea lasts for longer than several days, produces stools that float and smell foul, or if you also have abdominal cramps, bloating and fever.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In otherwise healthy people, giardiasis generally goes away completely within weeks, with or without treatment. In some cases,Giardiacan be a long-term problem if it is not treated.\n",

      "What is glaucoma?": "Glaucoma is a common eye condition in which vision is lost because of damage to the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries information about vision from the eye to the brain. In most cases, the optic nerve is damaged when the pressure of fluid inside the front part of the eye rises. However, glaucoma-related eye damage can occur even when the fluid pressure is normal.\nIn the most common form of glaucoma, calledprimary open angle glaucoma,fluid circulates freely in the eye and the pressure tends to rise slowly over time. Gradual loss of vision is usually the only symptom.\nA less common form of the disease, calledacute or angle closure glaucoma,develops suddenly and usually causes eye pain and redness. In this form of glaucoma, pressures rise quickly because normal fluid flow within the eye becomes blocked. This happens when a structure called the angle (where the iris and cornea meet) closes.\nWith both forms of glaucoma, lowering the pressure inside the eye decreases the risk that further damage to the optic nerve will occur.\nIn addition to open angle and angle closure glaucoma, there are rarer forms of the illness. They may be related to eye defects that develop before birth (congenital glaucoma) or to eye injuries, eye tumors or medical problems such as diabetes. In some cases, medications, such as corticosteroids, also can trigger glaucoma.\n",
      "Symptoms of glaucoma": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Up to half of people with glaucoma don't know that they have the condition. Glaucoma tends to run in families. It is five times more common in African-Americans than in Caucasians. The risk of glaucoma also increases with age in people of all ethnic backgrounds.\nAlthough open angle glaucoma and acute glaucoma both cause blindness, their symptoms are very different.\n",
      "Diagnosing glaucoma": "In most cases, open angle glaucoma is diagnosed by a doctor during a routine eye examination. When looking at the back of the eye (fundus) using a special telescope, he or she may notice changes in the appearance of the optic nerve. If glaucoma is suspected, your doctor will confirm the diagnosis with one or more additional tests:\nYour doctor will not diagnose glaucoma unless your optic nerve shows evidence of damage. However, some people will be found to have elevated eye pressure but no evidence of optic nerve damage. In this case, you may be told that you are a \"glaucoma suspect\" or have \"pre-glaucoma,\" but do not yet have the disease. It is important to remember that not everyone with elevated pressures will develop glaucoma, and that not everyone with glaucoma has elevated eye pressures.\nAngle closure glaucoma usually is diagnosed in a person who has developed a red, swollen eye and difficulties with vision. The eye pressure is usually quite high. Some people may be told by their eye doctor that they are at risk of angle closure glaucoma because their angle looks narrow.\n",
      "Expected duration of glaucoma": "Glaucoma is a lifelong illness, but proper treatment can prevent loss of vision.\n",
      "Preventing glaucoma": "In most people, glaucoma cannot be prevented. However, regular screening may help to identify people either with early stages of the disease or elevated eye pressures. Screening should be done by someone who is trained to recognize glaucoma, usually an ophthalmologist or optometrist.\nThere is no consensus about who should be screened for glaucoma. African Americans over age 40 have the highest risk of developing glaucoma. Family history of glaucoma and older age also increase your risk of the disease.\nMedicare covers glaucoma screening for people with diabetes, a family history of glaucoma, or African-Americans who are age 50 and older.\n",
      "Treating glaucoma": "Treatment of open angle glaucoma usually begins with prescription eye drops. These medicines lower pressure inside the eye.\nAs an alternative to medication or when medication fails to control glaucoma, laser therapy can be done. This procedure is called laser trabeculoplasty. Eye surgeons perform this procedure in the office or eye clinic. A high intensity beam of light is carefully aimed at openings in the eye's drainage system. The laser widens the openings to increase fluid drainage from the eye.\nLaser therapy may not lower eye pressure to acceptable levels. You may need to continue glaucoma eye drops after laser therapy.\nIf both medication and laser therapy are unsuccessful, conventional eye surgery may be necessary to make a new opening for fluid to leave the eye. Eye surgeons perform this procedure in the operating room. Intravenous medication is given to help you relax. Numbing medication is applied on and around the eye. The surgeon creates a new opening to improve fluid drainage from the eye.\nWith both types of glaucoma surgery, eye pressure almost always decreases. But the pressure might not be low enough. You may need repeat surgery and/or need to continue long term use of glaucoma eye drops.\nAcute glaucoma must be recognized and treated as soon as possible to prevent loss of vision. Even prior to seeing an ophthalmologist, eye drops and other medications are often started immediately to help lower eye pressure. The ophthalmologist will usually start with laser treatment to make a new opening in the iris that allows fluid to drain. This often cures the problem, but it sometimes is necessary to use eye drops long-term or to perform additional surgery.\nIf you have been diagnosed with glaucoma, be sure to follow up regularly with your eye doctor. It is also important that you use your medication as directed. Many people do not follow through with treatment because they feel fine and do not notice the gradual loss of their vision. However, it is important to remember that glaucoma treatment prevents further damage to your eye, but will not restore vision that has already been lost.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you notice any sudden loss of your vision, especially if you also have any pain or redness in the eye. Acute glaucoma is a sight-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent blindness.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the type of glaucoma:\n",

      "What is it?": "Glioblastoma multiforme is a fast-growing brain or spinal cord tumor. It affects the brain more often than the spinal cord. These tumors grow from glial cells which form the (supportive) tissue of the brain and spinal cord. Glioblastoma multiforme is also called glioblastoma, grade IV astrocytoma, or GBM.\nAs it grows, a brain tumor can press against or damage nerves or other structures. This can interfere with the brain's normal functioning. For example, a brain tumor can disrupt\nScientists do not know what causes most brain tumors. However, they are working to better understand the biology of glioblastoma multiforme and identify possible environmental, occupational, family, and genetic risk factors.\n",
      "Symptoms": "As brain tumors grow, they press against or damage nerves or other parts of the brain and interfere with thought, memory, emotion, movement, vision, hearing, touch, and other brain functions. Swelling and fluid buildup can also affect brain function.\nThe most common symptoms of glioblastoma are\nMany other conditions can cause these symptoms, but call your doctor promptly if you experience any of these problems.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Diagnosis often begins with a medical history. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and past illnesses and treatments.\nYour doctor will also do a neurological examination—she or he will check your\nHe or she may check your eyes for signs of increased pressure or swelling.\nYour doctor may also order one of the following imaging tests:\nThe only way to be sure that a brain tumor is a glioblastoma is by looking directly at the tumor tissue. Your doctor takes a sample of the tumor, which is then examined under the microscope.\nPatients with glioblastoma often work with several types of doctors. These specialists include\n",
      "Expected duration": "A brain tumor will continue growing until it is treated. Without treatment, permanent brain damage or death can result.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no known way to prevent glioblastoma. Some risk factors may increase a person's chance of developing a brain tumor. These include radiation therapy to the brain and certain inherited disorders.\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of glioblastoma usually requires surgery followed by additional cancer therapies. Treatment aims to\nTreatment depends on the patient's medical and personal situations. It generally includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.\nSurgery.In most cases, surgery is the first step in treatment. The goal is to remove as much of the tumor as possible. This helps to relieve symptoms. Doctors can also examine the tumor tissue to confirm the glioblastoma diagnosis.\nSometimes a biopsy is done instead of surgery to confirm the diagnosis. This might be done if a patient is not healthy enough to withstand surgery.\nGlioblastoma tumors grow like tentacles into surrounding brain tissue, so it is often not possible to remove them completely. That's why the treatment plan usually includes additional therapy to destroy the remaining cancer cells.\nRadiation.Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-ray beams to stop or slow tumor growth. Patients usually get radiation treatment following biopsy or surgery.\nExternal beam radiation therapy aims high-powered x-rays at the tumor and surrounding tissues from outside the body. Another approach is called interstitial radiation or brachytherapy. In this case, radioactive substances are implanted directly into a tumor.\nProton therapy is a type of radiation often used for patients with glioblastoma. Proton therapy provides pinpoint focusing of the radiation beam to the tumor. This lessens the chance of damage to surrounding normal brain tissue.\nChemotherapy.Chemotherapy uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells. It can be taken by mouth, or injected into a vein or muscle.\nSome chemotherapy drugs destroy cancerous cells or prevent them from reproducing. Others alter a tumor's behavior by changing the environment around it.\nSeveral medicines are available to help manage the symptoms of glioblastoma. These drugs can reduce swelling around the tumor, control seizures, and lessen nausea and vomiting.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if you experience any of the common symptoms of glioblastoma, including:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Glioblastoma tumors are among the most malignant. Younger patients tend to have better outcomes. Sadly, only a small percentage of adults survive five years beyond their diagnosis.\n",

      "What is gonorrhea?": "Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection that is caused by bacteria calledNeisseria gonorrhoeae. These bacteria can be passed from person to person during sexual activity (vaginal, oral and anal intercourse) leading to infections of the urethra (urine tube), cervix, vagina and anus. If untreated, these gonorrhea infections can spread to higher portions of the reproductive tract, causing prostatitis (prostate inflammation) and epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis) in men, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women.\nGonorrhea also can cause gonococcal proctitis (inflammation of the anus and rectum). In people who practice oral sex, it may infect the throat, causing gonococcal pharyngitis.\nLess commonly, gonorrhea can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream, causing fever, a characteristic rash and arthritis. In pregnant women with untreated gonorrhea, bacteria may spread to the eyes of their babies during childbirth, causing gonococcal ophthalmia, a severe eye infection in newborns.\n",
      "Symptoms of gonorrhea": "Many people who are infected with gonorrhea will not have any symptoms. Women are more likely not to have symptoms than men. When the disease causes symptoms, they usually develop within 10 days after sexual intercourse with an infected person. Men may develop a discharge from the urethra (the opening at the end of the penis where urine comes out), redness around the urethra, frequent urination and pain or a burning discomfort during urination.\nWomen may develop pain or discomfort on urination, frequent urination, a vaginal discharge and discomfort in the anal or rectal area. In some women, the bacteria will spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pain during intercourse, abdominal pain, abnormal menstrual bleeding and fever. In cases of gonococcal pharyngitis, there may not be any symptoms or the person may have a sore throat.\nMany people with gonococcal proctitis don't have any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they commonly include rectal pain or itching, a rectal discharge that contains blood, mucus, pus or a persistent urge to move the bowels.\nIf gonorrhea spreads through the bloodstream, it may cause fever, pain and swelling in several joints, and a characteristic rash.\nIn newborns infected with gonococcal ophthalmia, symptoms appear one to four days after birth and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms include redness of the eyes, swelling of the eyelids, and an eye discharge that is thick and contains pus. If untreated, gonococcal ophthalmia can cause blindness.\n",
      "Diagnosing gonorrhea": "Your doctor may suspect gonorrhea based on your symptoms, sexual history and the results of physical and gynecological examinations. Your doctor can confirm the diagnosis of gonococcal infection by swabbing the affected area (urethra, cervix, rectum, throat) and sending the sample to a laboratory for culture (a test to see if bacteria grow). The sample also can be tested to detect genetic material in the gonorrhea bacteria.\nIn people suspected of having infection that has spread beyond the genital tract, other fluids, such as blood or joint fluid, can be sampled for culture.\n",
      "Expected duration of gonorrhea": "Gonorrhea infections rapidly improve with antibiotic therapy. If an infected woman is untreated, gonorrhea can spread to the fallopian tubes, where it can cause scarring and infertility.\n",
      "Preventing gonorrhea": "Since gonorrhea is transmitted during sexual activity, you can prevent infection by:\nTo prevent gonococcal ophthalmia in newborns, all pregnant women at risk for gonorrhea should be tested during the first prenatal visit and, if necessary, be treated for gonorrhea. Women at risk for infection during pregnancy should have the test repeated during the third trimester.\nAs another preventive measure, newborns can be routinely treated at birth with anti-infective eye drops or eye ointment.\n",
      "Treating gonorrhea": "The bacteria that cause gonorrhea have become resistant to many of the antibiotics that were very effective in the past. The current guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend treatment with a single intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone.\nAll sex partners of an infected person must be treated as well.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have any of the symptoms of gonorrhea infections. Also call your doctor if you have participated in sexual activity with someone who has a gonorrhea infection, especially if you are pregnant.\nAll sexually active women should schedule a routine physical examination, including a pelvic examination every year, even if they have no symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If gonorrhea infections are diagnosed and treated quickly and correctly, recovery usually is complete unless pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) develops. PID is more likely to develop if treatment is delayed. It can cause infertility, scarred fallopian tubes (a risk of tubal pregnancy in women) and chronic (long-lasting) abdominal pain.\nHealth experts recommend that all patients treated for gonorrhea should be treated for chlamydia as well because 15% to 25% of males and 35% to 50% of females with gonorrhea have chlamydia infections.\n",

      "What is it?": "Gout is a disorder characterized by too much uric acid in the blood and tissues. In gout, crystals of uric acid are deposited in the joints, where they cause a type of arthritis called gouty arthritis. These same crystals can also deposit in the kidneys, where they can cause kidney stones.\nThere are three main causes of the high levels of uric acid that lead to gout:\nObesity or sudden weight gain can cause high uric acid levels because the body's tissues break down more purines.\nIn some people, gout is caused by a combination of these factors. People with a family history of gout are more likely to develop the condition.\nAbout 90% of patients with gout are men older than 40. Gout is quite rare in younger women; when women develop gout, they are usually post-menopausal.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The first attack of gouty arthritis usually involves only one joint, most commonly the big toe. However, it can affect other joints, such as a knee, ankle, wrist, foot or finger. In gouty arthritis, the joint can become red, swollen and extremely tender to the touch. Typically, even a bed sheet brushing against the joint will trigger intense pain.\nAfter the first attack of gout, later episodes are more likely to involve more than one joint at the same time. Sometimes, if gout lasts for many years, uric acid crystals can collect in the joints or tendons, under the skin, or on the outside the ears, forming a whitish deposit called a tophus.\n\nIllustration: Scott Leighton\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about your medications, diet, alcohol use, and about any family history of gout. Your doctor will examine you, and he or she will look at your painful joints and search your skin for tophi.\nYour doctor may use a sterile needle to remove a sample of fluid from your inflamed joint. This joint fluid will be examined in a laboratory for microscopic uric acid crystals, which confirm the diagnosis of gouty arthritis. Your doctor also may order blood tests to assess the function of your kidneys and to measure the level of uric acid in your blood. Imaging tests, such as ultrasound or CT scanning, can also be useful to diagnose gout.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Without treatment, the pain of gouty arthritis usually lasts for several days, but it is most intense during the first 24 to 36 hours. The interval between attacks varies a lot. Some people have them every few weeks, while others go years between attacks. After several gout attacks, a joint may take longer to improve or stay inflamed and painful.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent gout:\n",
      "Treatment": "To treat an attack of gouty arthritis, your doctor usually will begin by prescribing a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as indomethacin (Indocin), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) or naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn and others). Moderate to high dose aspirin should be avoided because it can raise the level of uric acid in your blood (although low dose aspirin for prevention of heart disease or stroke has little effect on gout).\nIf you cannot tolerate an NSAID, or if these drugs don't work for you, your doctor may suggest a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are most commonly given orally or injected directly into the affected joint.\nA drug called colchicine may be used, but it often causes unpleasant side effects (such as nausea, vomiting, cramps, and diarrhea) before it helps the arthritis.\nIn rare cases an injectable medication, including anakinra or canakinumab, may be recommended, especially if other options are not effective.\nTo reduce uric acid in the body and prevent attacks of gout, your doctor may prescribe allopurinol (Aloprim, Zyloprim) or febuxostat (Uloric) to make your body produce less uric acid. Genetic testing (for a variant called HLA-B*5801) may be recommended to determine whether there is a high risk of an allergic reaction to allopurinol.\nAnother option to lower uric acid is to take a medication (such as Probenecid) that makes your kidneys excrete more uric acid than usual.\nAnother medication to lower uric acid is pegloticase (Krystexxa), which may be given along with methotrexate to prevent drug reactions and improve its effectiveness. In some countries, other medications are available to lower uric acid, including lesinurad, benzbromarone, and sulfinpyrazone. These medications are prescribed less often because allopurinol works so well for most people with gout.\nMedications to lower uric acid levels are usually taken indefinitely. If discontinued, the uric acid level will usually rise again and attacks of gout are likely to resume.\nWhen your doctor prescribes a medication to reduce uric acid in your blood, he or she also should prescribe a second medication to prevent a gout attack. That's because any change in uric acid levels, up or down, can trigger an attack. These preventive medications include a low dose of colchicine or a low dose of an NSAID. Once the uric acid is lowered enough for a prolonged period (about 6 months), the preventive medication can be stopped.\nTreatment to lower uric acid may be recommended when:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have pain and swelling in a joint. If you have had gout in the past, your doctor may suggest you have NSAIDs available so you can take them at the earliest sign of an attack.\n",
      "Prognosis": "More than 50% of people who have had one attack of gouty arthritis will have a second, usually within six months to two years. For people with more severe disease, long-term preventive medication is highly effective at lowering uric acid, which can prevent attacks and, over months to years, cause tophi to resolve.\n",

      "What is it?": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare disease marked by inflammation of the blood vessels. The condition is potentially life-threatening. It was formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis.\nIn GPA, inflammation damages the walls of small- and medium-sized arteries and veins. This damage interferes with normal blood supply to nearby tissues. As a result, tissues in many parts of the body may be injured and destroyed.\nTissues affected by GPA contain islands of inflamed cells. These are called granulomas.\nThree areas in the body are affected most commonly:\nIn some cases, GPA involves other organs. This may include the eyes, ears, skin, joints, heart and nerves.\nGPA is believed to be an autoimmune disorder. This means the body's immune defenses mistakenly attack the body's own cells and tissues. In this case, the misdirected immune attack is aimed at the blood vessels. This triggers inflammation and damage.\n",
      "Symptoms": "When GPA first develops, most people have upper respiratory complaints. Common symptoms of GPA include:\nAs the disease gets worse, upper respiratory symptoms usually worsen. Other parts of the body can be affected, too.\nThe following symptoms may occur, depending on the location and severity of the inflammation:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may suspect GPA if you have:\nAndyour symptoms have worsened despite treatment for more common conditions, such as pneumonia or a sinus infection.\nMany early symptoms of GPA are similar to those of milder and more common respiratory problems. As a result, the average person with GPA often has symptoms for months before the correct diagnosis is made.\nYour doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. This will include any treatments that you have received so far.\nYour doctor will conduct a thorough physical examination. He or she will carefully check your entire respiratory tract, from the tip of your nose to the base of your lungs. The doctor will look for evidence of inflammation and tissue injury. Your doctor may also examine your eyes, ears, heart and skin.\nAfter the physical exam, your doctor may send you for tests. These tests will look for inflammation and organ damage. The tests will focus on your upper respiratory tract, lungs and kidneys. These tests may include:\nThese tests also help to check for other illnesses that may cause symptoms similar to GPA.\nThe only way to confirm this diagnosis is to have a biopsy. Tissue is taken from an affected organ. It is then examined under a microscope to check for granulomas and areas of inflammation.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can rapidly lead to death in people with multiple affected organs that do not get appropriate treatment.\nWith treatment, symptoms can go away for long periods. However, setbacks are common. Most people are in treatment and under a doctor's supervision for at least two years from the time of diagnosis.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no known way to prevent granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n",
      "Treatment": "Initial treatment for granulomatosis with polyangiitis usually includes the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid drug prednisone. For milder or more limited disease, your doctor may also recommend treatment with the drug methotrexate (Folex, Rheumatrex).\nFor active or severe disease, your doctor may recommend treatment with a combination of two drugs: prednisone along with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar) or rituximab (Rituxan). Cyclophosphamide and rituximab are powerful immune-suppressing medications.\nAs your symptoms subside, your doctor will try to reduce the dosage of each drug gradually.\nOnce your condition improves and you've taken cyclophosphamide or rituximab for three to six months, your doctor may suggest switching medications. He or she may recommend methotrexate, azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), or other immune-suppressing medications. Treatment lasting a year or more is common; longer periods of treatment may be necessary if disease control is interrupted by periods of active disease.\nCyclophosphamide can cause serious side effects such as bladder damage (especially bleeding) and an increased risk of bladder cancer. Cyclophosphamide and rituximab increase a person's risk of serious infections.\nIf you develop serious side effects related to these medications, your doctor may prescribe an alternative medication.\nA procedure called plasmapheresis may help some people. In this procedure, blood is filtered and returned to the body. This procedure may help because it removes harmful antibodies but details about why it may work are unknown.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you have a chronic stuffy nose, runny nose, nosebleeds or cough. Keep in mind that even with these symptoms, it's likely that you have a sinus or viral infection as these conditions are much more common than granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With treatment, more than 85% of people with granulomatosis with polyangiitis survive for seven years or longer after diagnosis. With treatment, most people with the condition enter remission. However, as many as half will relapse when medication is reduced or stopped. Those who do not relapse may remain in remission for many years, often without needing more medication.\n",

      "What is Graves' disease?": "Graves' disease is a disorder of the immune system that causes the thyroid gland to become overactive. It is an autoimmune disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells instead of protecting them from outside invaders. In Graves' disease, the body's immune system makes abnormal chemicals called immunoglobulins that stimulate the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. This overactive thyroid state is called hyperthyroidism.\nDoctors don't know what causes Graves' disease, but the fact that it tends to run in families indicates that the disease may have a genetic (inherited) component. It is possible that the abnormal production of immunoglobulins is triggered by some unknown factor in the environment, and the immune system fails to stop this overproduction because of an inherited defect.\nGraves' disease affects women more than men. It most frequently strikes between the ages of 20 and 40 but can occur at any age.\n",
      "Symptoms of Graves' disease": "Graves' disease can cause the following symptoms:\nIn women, menstrual periods may become less frequent or stop altogether. In older people, particularly people with heart disease, the disease may cause heart failure or heart-related chest pain called angina.\nGraves' disease also may cause:\n",
      "Diagnosing Graves' disease": "Your doctor will look for physical evidence of Graves' disease, including goiter, eye signs, and skin signs. He or she also will ask you about recent weight loss, nervousness, tremors (shakes), increased sweating, palpitations, unusually frequent bowel movements, menstrual irregularities, and whether you feel hot all the time.\nDuring your physical examination, your doctor will feel your thyroid for abnormal nodules (lumps) and to see if it is enlarged. He or she also may use a stethoscope to listen for signs of abnormal blood flow near your thyroid gland. In other parts of your body, your doctor will check for additional signs of hyperthyroidism, including fast heart rate, irregular heart rhythm, hand tremor, fast reflexes when tendons are tapped with a soft hammer, and bulging eyes.\nYour doctor will order blood tests to determine whether your thyroid is producing and releasing too much hormone. If your doctor is concerned about potential eye problems, he or she may order a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your eyes. If your doctor thinks your heart is involved, an electrocardiogram (EKG) and/or other cardiac tests probably will be needed.\n",
      "Expected duration of Graves' disease": "Almost all patients with Graves' need treatment, at least initially. Symptoms related to the high levels of circulating thyroid hormone will quickly improve with medications such as beta blockers and tranquilizers. It takes several weeks for the action of anti-thyroid medications to lower thyroid blood levels toward normal. Anti-thyroid medication is continued for at least one year unless another treatment is used.\n",
      "Preventing Graves' disease": "There is no way to prevent Graves' disease.\n",
      "Treating Graves' disease": "Treatment focuses on two goals: rapidly improving the hyperthyroid symptoms, and slowing the thyroid's production of thyroid hormone.\nSymptoms of palpitations, increased heart rate, tremor, and nervousness are treated with a beta-blocker medication such as propranolol (Inderal). For anxiety and insomnia, your doctor may prescribe diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), or a similar medication.\nTo stop the thyroid from producing too much hormone, there are three possible treatments: antithyroid medications, radioactive iodine, and surgery.\nGraves' disease is most often treated with the anti-thyroid drug methimazole (Tapazole, generic versions). Methimazole blocks the formation of thyroid hormones. Another anti-thyroid drug called propylthiouracil is also available. However, it should only be used in patients who cannot tolerate methimazole and in women just before and during their first trimester of pregnancy. Once thyroid hormone levels have reached normal, you and your doctor can decide whether to continue daily anti-thyroid medication or to choose radioactive iodine treatment.\nRadioactive iodine is given by mouth. Most specialists recommend a large enough dose to completely stop the thyroid from producing thyroid hormone. You would then have to take thyroid medication daily for the rest of your life. Because people who receive radioactive iodine therapy temporarily store a small amount of radiation in their thyroid, they need to avoid prolonged contact with pregnant women and children for several days following treatment. Radioactive iodine is concentrated in breast milk and women must stop breast feeding if they choose this therapy.\nSurgery for Graves' disease is done less often. However, people with very large goiters are less likely to respond well to anti-thyroid medication or radioactive iodine, and may have a better outcome if most of the thyroid gland is removed surgically (called subtotal thyroidectomy). Your doctor also may recommend surgery if you have severe thyroid eye disease.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have any of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including:\nAlso call your doctor if you develop swelling or skin changes in your feet or lower legs, or if you notice a change in your eye appearance or eye function.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many patients remain well after a single course of anti-thyroid drugs, but recurrence can happen at any time. Radioactive iodine is very effective, but often results in abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). Surgery also can cause low levels of thyroid hormones.\nThe eye signs of Graves' disease tend to improve with anti-thyroid drug treatment. However, some element of the staring appearance often remains.\n",

      "What is it?": "Guillain-Barr' syndrome is an uncommon disorder that causes damage to the peripheral nerves. These nerves send messages from the brain to the muscles, instructing the muscles to move. They also carry sensations such as pain from the body to the brain. The nerve damage often causes muscle weakness, often to the point of paralysis, and can cause problems with sensation, including pain, tingling, \"crawling skin\" or a certain amount of numbness.\nGuillain-Barr' syndrome can become a medical emergency if the weakness affects the chest muscles responsible for breathing. If chest muscles become paralyzed, the patient can die from lack of oxygen. People with this syndrome must be carefully monitored, usually in a hospital, to make sure that breathing and other vital functions are maintained.\nGuillain-Barr' syndrome happens when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the myelin sheath, which wraps around long nerve cell bodies much like insulation around a water pipe. Myelin protects the nerve and helps to speed the transmission of electrical impulses down the nerve. If the myelin is destroyed, nerve impulses travel very slowly and can become disrupted. If muscles don't get proper stimulation through the nerves, they will not function properly.\nMost cases of Guillain-Barr' syndrome occur after an infection. The most common infectious trigger isCampylobacter jejuni, a bacterial intestinal infection that causes diarrhea. This nerve condition also can happen following a viral infection, including the common cold, influenza, and COVID-19. Occasionally, Guillain-Barr' syndrome seems to follow immunization.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of Guillain-Barr' syndrome vary from person to person and may be mild or severe. Most often, the first obvious symptom is weakness, and most often the weakness is felt in both legs. Over time, the weakness often involves the arms or head, affecting eye and head movement and speech. Occasionally, the weakness will affect the arms or muscles of the head before affecting the legs.\nSometimes the weakness is preceded or accompanied by a sensation of tingling, most often in the lower legs and feet. Guillain-Barr' syndrome can affect the body's autonomic nervous system and impair control of blood pressure, leading to dangerously low blood pressure when the person rises to stand after lying down or sitting.\nThe disorder may progress quickly, with most patients experiencing the worst weakness of legs, arms, chest and other muscle groups within three weeks of the start of the disease. In some cases, the weakness may worsen very rapidly. When this happens, weakness in the legs can become complete paralysis of the legs, arms and muscles of breathing within a day or two. For that reason, a person who develops sudden weakness in the legs or arms should contact a doctor immediately.\nThe weakness may last days, weeks or months before sensation begins to return. Returning to pre-illness strength and functioning can take months or years. Most patients return to normal within months.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Guillain-Barr' syndrome can be difficult to diagnose in its earliest stages because other disorders may have similar symptoms, and because the exact symptoms experienced may vary from patient to patient.\nYour doctor will ask you about your medical history and your symptoms.\nTwo tests may be performed to help your doctor determine the diagnosis:\n",
      "Expected duration": "There is no way to predict how long Guillain-Barr' syndrome will last. The symptoms usually reach their peak by about the third week of the disorder. The symptoms can remain at that level for days, weeks or months, and then gradually get better. Strength slowly returns. It may take only several weeks or as long as three years. Most people recover completely within a few months, but some never regain full strength and may require surgery, physical therapy or orthopedic appliances to correct problems or train the body to adapt.\n",
      "Prevention": "Because no one knows what causes Guillain-Barr' syndrome, there is no way to prevent it.\n",
      "Treatment": "Most patients with Guillain-Barr' syndrome are hospitalized, because the disorder can weaken the chest muscles to such an extent that breathing becomes difficult or impossible. In a hospital, patients can be monitored and put on a respirator, if necessary. If Guillain-Barr' syndrome causes paralysis of the leg or arm muscles, the affected person will need help with activities of daily living such as eating and eliminating wastes. Close monitoring of cardiac function and blood pressure and other supportive care (including psychological support, pain control, skin care, prevention of blood clots, and physical therapy) are also important.\nTwo treatments have been shown to reduce the severity of Guillain-Barr' syndrome and speed recovery:\nThese two types of treatments are considered equally effective; the choice of treatment is usually determined by factors such as treatment availability and patient preference.  IVIG is often chosen due to its ease of administration.  Other treatments for Guillain-Barr' syndrome are under investigation.\nAfter recovery has begun, patients likely will need physical therapy to help them regain strength and proper movement.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call a health care professional immediately if you experience weakness in your legs, arms or the muscles of your head that gets worse over a few hours or days.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The long-term outlook for Guillain-Barr' syndrome is generally good. Most patients recover fully, although it can take months or years to regain pre-illness strength and movement. About 30% of patients still have some weakness three years after the illness strikes. About 3% of patients have weakness and tingling return years later.\n",

      "What is hair loss?": "Hair loss can range from mild hair thinning to total baldness. Hair can fall out for many different reasons. Medically, hair loss falls into several categories, including:\n\n\n",
      "Symptoms of hair loss": "We normally lose approximately 50 to 100 scalp hairs each day. If more than this is falling out, you may find unusually large amounts of hair in brushes, on clothing, and in the drains of sinks and tubs. You may also notice that your hair is generally thinner, that your part is wider, that your hairline has changed or that one or more bald patches have appeared.\nWhen hair loss is the result of telogen effluvium or medication side effects, the hair loss usually is all over the head, while in tinea infections and alopecia areata, the hair loss occurs in small patches. Also, tinea infections can cause additional symptoms, such as scaling of the scalp or areas of broken hairs that look like black dots. In traumatic alopecia, the area of hair loss depends on the method of hair injury and follows the pattern inflicted by hot rollers, braiding or chemical treatments. In male-pattern baldness, the hairline usually begins to recede at the temples first, followed by thinning at the top of the head. Gradually, the crown area becomes totally bald, leaving a fringe of hair around the back and sides of the head.\n",
      "Diagnosing hair loss": "Your doctor will diagnose the cause of your hair loss based on your medical history, the medications you take, your nutritional status, your hairdressing habits and a physical examination. If your doctor suspects a fungal infection of your scalp, he or she may take a hair sample for laboratory testing. Blood tests probably will be needed if your doctor suspects a medical illness (such as lupus) or a thyroid problem, iron deficiency or sex-hormone imbalance.\n",
      "Expected duration of hair loss": "How long hair loss lasts depends on the cause. In telogen effluvium, for example, hair usually is lost over several weeks to months, but then grows back over the next several months. When hair loss is a side effect of a medication, hair growth usually returns to normal once the drug is stopped. If you are losing hair because of damage from hairdressing, the hair loss usually stops after you change to more natural styling, except in traction alopecia, which results from years of pulling the hair back in tight braids. In tinea scalp infection, the fungus that causes the problem must be treated for at least 6 to 12 weeks and hair regrowth may be slow. Early treatment is important in preventing possible permanent hair loss. Both male- and female-pattern baldness tend to get worse over time but can be treated.\n",
      "Preventing hair loss": "Some forms of hair loss can be prevented by minimizing stress, eating a healthy diet and using sensible hairdressing techniques, and, if possible, switching to medications that do not cause hair loss. Hair loss from fungal infections can be prevented by keeping hair clean and by never sharing hats, combs or brushes with other people. Hair loss from hereditary-pattern baldness can sometimes be prevented by medication.\n",
      "Treating hair loss": "Hair loss resulting from telogen effluvium or drug side effects usually requires no treatment other than discontinuing the medication that is causing the problem. Limiting trauma or chemical exposure (such as use of a blow dryer, hair straightener, coloring or perms) may limit or stop hair loss. Hair loss from poor nutrition or medical illness usually stops with the adoption of a healthy diet and treatment of the underlying medical condition.\nTreatment of fungal scalp infection can be treated with oral medications, such as terbinafine (Lamisil), griseofulvin (Grifulvin V) or itraconazole (Sporanox), with or without shampoos containing selenium sulfide (Selsun Blue, Head & Shoulders, others), ketoconazole (Nizoral) or ciclopirox (Loprox).\nTreatment options for alopecia areata include corticosteroids injected or applied to the skin, baricitinib (Olumiant) or ritlecitinib (Litfulo), anthralin cream (Drithocreme, DrithoScalp, Psoriatec), minoxidil (Rogaine) or a combination of these therapies. Another treatment approach is topical immunotherapy in which a dermatologist applies diphenylcyclopropenone or squaric acid dibutyl ester.\nMany men and women with hereditary-pattern baldness do not seek treatment for hair loss. For those who do seek medical treatment, initial therapy is usually topical minoxidil (Rogaine).  If not effective, men may be treated with oral finasteride (Propecia, Proscar) or dutasteride (Avodart) while women may be treated with finasteride or spironolactone. Other options for men and women include changing minoxidil from a topical to an oral formulation, injections of platelet-rich plasma, or low-level laser therapy. Finally, some people with hereditary-pattern baldness elect to wear a wig or hair piece, have hair transplant surgery, or have scalp-reduction surgery.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you are concerned about hair loss, especially if you are having other unexplained symptoms.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many forms of hair loss are either self-limited (telogen effluvium or drug side effects) or respond to treatment with medication (tinea capitis). Even hereditary-pattern baldness tends to improve with treatment. However, treatment must continue indefinitely. In some conditions, hair loss cannot be reversed, especially if scarring has developed (as can happen in lupus-related scalp disease).\n",

      "What is a hammertoe?": "The smallest four toes of each foot have three bony segments connected by two joints, just as the fingers do. Hammertoe is a deformity in which one or more of the small toes develops a bend at the joint between the first and second segments so that the tip of the toe turns downward, making it looks like a hammer or claw. The second toe is affected most often.\n\nMost hammertoes are caused by an imbalance of muscles in the foot that apply pressure to the joints and tendons of the toes. Wearing ill-fitting, tight, or high-heeled shoes over a long period of time is a major contributor to this condition. Shoes that don't fit well can crowd the toes, putting pressure on the middle toes and causing them to curl downward. The condition may be more likely when the second toe is longer than the first toe or when the arch of the foot is flat.\nHammertoe can also be present at birth (congenital). Hammertoe also can be caused by a bunion, which is the knobby bump that sometimes develops at the side of the big toe. A bunion causes the big toe to bend toward the other toes. The big toe can then overlap and crowd the smaller toes. Occasionally, a hammertoe is inherited or caused by arthritis in the toe joint.\nIf the toes remain in the hammertoe position for long periods, the tendons on the top of the foot will tighten over time because they are not stretched to their full length. Eventually, the tendons shorten enough that the toe stays bent, even when shoes are not being worn.\n",
      "Symptoms of hammertoe": "The symptoms of hammertoe include:\nin its early stages, hammertoe is not obvious. Frequently, hammertoe does not cause any symptoms except for the clawlike toe shape. However, it can lead to calluses or ulcers where the misshapen toe is irritated by the shoe.\n",
      "Diagnosing hammertoe": "Most health care professionals can diagnose hammertoe simply by examining your toes and feet. X-rays of the feet are not needed to diagnose hammertoe, but they may be useful to look for signs of some types of arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis) or other disorders that can cause hammertoe. If the deformed toe is very painful, your doctor may recommend that you have a fluid sample withdrawn from the joint with a needle so the fluid can be checked for signs of inflammation or gout (arthritis from crystal deposits).\n",
      "Expected duration of hammertoe": "Unless treated, hammertoe is permanent.\n",
      "Preventing hammertoe": "Most cases of hammertoe can be prevented by wearing shoes that fit properly and give the toes plenty of room. Some recommended guidelines include:\nIf you notice the beginning signs of hammertoe, you may be able to prevent the tendons from tightening by wearing toe-friendly shoes, by flattening your toes regularly, and by soaking your feet every day in warm water, then stretching your toes and ankles by pointing your toes.\nFoot exercises also can help to maintain or restore the flexibility of the tendons. One simple exercise is to place a small towel on the floor and then pick it up using only your toes. You also can grasp at carpet with your toes, or curl your toes up and down repeatedly.\n",
      "Treating hammertoe": "Treating hammertoe involves straightening the toe, making tendons in the toes flexible again, and preventing the problem from returning. Some simple treatments include:\nIn advanced cases in which the toe has become stiff and permanently bent, the toe can be straightened with surgery. One type of surgery involves removing a small section of the toe bone to allow the toe to lie flat. Surgery for hammertoe usually is classified as a cosmetic procedure. Cosmetic foot surgeries sometimes result in complications such as pain or numbness, so it's better to treat the problem with a shoe that fits properly. Pain due to hammertoe may be treated with acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment with a health care professional if you experience pain in your toes or feet that lasts longer than several days. If one or more of your toes begins curling, see your doctor or a podiatrist (foot doctor) to discuss early treatment to avoid hammertoe. If you already have hammertoe and find it bothersome, call a health care professional for an evaluation.\nIf you have diabetes and experience any toe or foot pain or toe problems, including hammertoe or corns, see a physician promptly to avoid potential infection or skin complications.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Hammertoe is often a harmless and painless condition. Although the toe may be curled permanently, hammertoe should not cause any long-term problems other than a more difficult time finding shoes that fit. If hammertoe is treated and preventive measures are followed, the condition should not return. Wearing tight or constricting shoes can cause hammertoe to return.\n",

      "What is it?": "Hay fever, also known as seasonal allergic rhinitis, is an allergy-related inflammation of the nasal passages, throat and eye membrane (conjunctiva), caused by sensitivity to airborne pollens and molds. These airborne pollens come from various species of trees, grasses, weeds and other plants whose pollens are carried by the wind rather than by insects.\nBecause different types of pollen trigger symptoms in different people, each person's specific hay fever \"season\" is fairly predictable and is related to times when their allergy-triggering plant is in bloom. For example, for people who are allergic to tree pollens and who live in temperate North America, symptoms usually are worst from March through May, when trees are blossoming. June and July are peak months for people allergic to grasses, while people with ragweed allergies suffer the worst symptoms from mid-August through October.\nSince molds depend on damp, dark conditions, people who are allergic to molds tend to have the least predictable allergy season. They usually find that their symptoms are more related to warm, rainy weather. In the United States, this means summer and fall are peak times.\nHay fever and its sister ailment, perennial allergic rhinitis (a year-round sensitivity to animal dander, dust mites or cockroaches), are most common in people who have a family history of allergies or a personal history of allergy-related conditions, such as eczema and childhood asthma. Although seasonal allergic rhinitis can affect people in all age groups, its symptoms generally peak during childhood and adolescence.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of hay fever usually begin before age 30. They typically include:\nThe congested nose can lead to mouth breathing, and the dripping mucus can cause persistent cough and sore throat. Because hay fever also causes swelling in the sinuses and near the opening of the Eustachian tube (passage that connects the throat to the middle ear), sufferers can develop additional symptoms of secondary sinus infections or ear infections.\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms, especially about when you have them and whether they occur outdoors or indoors. Your doctor also will ask about your family history of allergies and your personal history of allergy-related conditions, including eczema, hives and asthma.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will make the diagnosis of hay fever based on your allergy history, the timing and appearance of your symptoms and the results of your physical examination. During your physical examination, your doctor will check for signs of inflammation in your eyes, nose and throat. Typically, the lining of the nose is swollen and pale pink or bluish, though it can be red. The doctor often looks for other signs of allergic rhinitis, such as dark circles under the eyes (called allergic shiners), resulting from chronic sinus congestion, wrinkles under the eyes as a result of chronic puffiness around the eyes, and a crease across the nose from frequently wiping it and pushing it upward.\nTo identify the specific allergen (allergy-triggering substance) that is triggering your hay fever, your doctor may refer you to an allergist, who can do skin testing. In skin testing, a small amount of a specific allergen is scratched, pricked or injected into the skin. Results are available in 10 to 20 minutes.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Blood tests also can be done to measure eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that increases in number during allergy seasons) or levels of IgE, an allergy-inducing antibody. An elevated eosinophil count or IgE level tells the doctor that there is an allergic response, while skin tests provide more specific information about what the person it allergic to. Blood tests are most helpful when skin testing cannot be done, such as when someone has severe eczema.\nAlthough hay fever symptoms can reappear each year when the offending plant begins to bloom, they tend to diminish as you get older. Some people don't develop hay fever until adulthood.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help prevent attacks of hay fever by reducing your exposure to the suspected allergens. It helps to:\n",
      "Treatment": "Although the best way to treat hay fever is to minimize exposure to the allergens, it is almost impossible to completely avoid airborne allergens such as pollen. There are many medicines, both prescription and nonprescription, to treat hay fever and its symptoms. Nonprescription decongestant sprays and pills can be used to relieve nasal congestion. Decongestant nasal sprays can give relief for a few days but they can cause congestion to get worse if they are used for more than three days.\nAnother nonprescription nasal spray, cromolyn sodium, prevents allergy symptoms by blocking the release of an irritating substance called histamine. Antihistamines are also available in nasal spray and pill form. You may need to work with your doctor to find the specific antihistamine that best relieves your symptoms with the fewest side effects.\nCorticosteroid nasal sprays, such as beclomethasone (Beconase, Vancenase), budesonide (Nasonex) and fluticasone (Flonase), are probably the most effective treatment for hay fever and perennial allergic rhinitis. People with seasonal allergies should start the nasal corticosteroid spray a week or two before an expected rise in pollen counts.\nMontelukast (Singular) can be used alone or in combination with other medications to treat allergic rhinitis. It is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, which decreases the allergic response in a different way than either antihistamines or corticosteroids. It is taken by mouth once a day. But montelukast is not as effective as corticosteroid nasal sprays.\nIf steroid sprays and antihistamines fail, or if you have perennial symptoms, your doctor may recommend trying allergy shots (immunotherapy), a treatment aimed at desensitizing your body's immune reaction to a particular allergen. In immunotherapy, increasing concentrations of the allergen are injected under your skin either weekly or biweekly. If immunotherapy is effective, allergy symptoms usually subside within six months to a year. Treatment often is continued for three to five years.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you think you might have hay fever and the symptoms interfere with your normal everyday activities or make you feel generally miserable, or if you have hay fever and your symptoms are not controlled by your current medications.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, hay fever can be managed successfully by minimizing exposure to the allergens and treating with one or more medications. Without medical treatment, most people with hay fever find that their symptoms gradually diminish as they grow older.\n",

      "What is it?": "Trauma to the head can cause several types of head and brain injuries, also called traumatic brain injury (TBI). Problems from head injury include:\n\nIn the United States, the most common causes of head injuries are motor vehicle accidents, falls, and violent assaults.\nTraumatic brain injury can also be caused by exposure to blast explosives in military combat, even if there is no direct contact with shrapnel. This is sometimes called \"shell shock.\" Explosions cause a wave of changed atmospheric pressure, and brain movement within the skull can occur as a soldier recoils from a blast.\nUp to 75% of people with severe head injuries also suffer serious damage to the neck bones or other parts of the body during the same injury.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Head injuries can cause a wide variety of symptoms, depending on the type of injury, its severity, and its location. Some doctors classify head injuries into three categories, based on symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "All head injuries should be evaluated promptly by a doctor, so either call for emergency help or have a friend or family member drive you to an emergency department. Once you arrive at the emergency department, the doctor will want to know:\nIf you are not able to answer these questions, the information can be provided by a family member, friend, or the emergency medical personnel who brought you to the hospital.\nThe doctor will do a physical and neurological examination, including assessments of your pupil size, reflexes, sensation, and muscle strength. If the results of these exams are normal, you may not need further tests. However, the doctor may decide to monitor your condition in the hospital.\nIf you have more severe head injuries, emergency personnel will try to stabilize your condition as much as possible before arrival at the hospital. To do this, they may pass a tube down your throat and windpipe (trachea) to help breathing with a mechanical ventilator, control any bleeding from open wounds, give medication intravenously (injected into a vein) to maintain blood pressure, and immobilize the neck in case of a cervical fracture.\nOnce you arrive at the hospital and are stabilized, the doctor will do a brief physical and neurological evaluation. This will be followed by a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and spinal x-rays, if necessary. In most cases, a CT scan is the best way to detect skull fractures, brain injury, or bleeding inside the head.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Even if your head injury is only mild, you may have difficulty concentrating temporarily and may experience occasional headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. This collection of symptoms is caused by a concussion. When symptoms are long-lasting, they are called post-concussion syndrome. A concussion usually improves within three months.\nYou should not play contact sports until you have healed fully from a concussion and have received clearance to return from a medical professional who is certified to perform this function.\nThe goal is to prevent two serious problems – repeat concussion and brain hemorrhage. Both of these are more likely to occur if the brain is still recovering from a first concussion.\nA severe head injury can be fatal, or can require an extended hospital stay with prolonged rehabilitation. In some cases, disability is permanent.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent head injuries, try the following suggestions:\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have minor head trauma, your doctor may decide to monitor your condition in the emergency department for a short period of time or to admit you to the hospital for a brief period of observation. While you are in the emergency department or in a hospital room, medical personnel will ask you periodically about your symptoms, check your vital signs, and confirm that you are awake and can respond.\nOnce your doctor is satisfied that you can be sent home safely, he or she will allow you to leave on the condition that a responsible adult will stay with you at home for a day or two to help monitor your condition. This person will be given specific instructions about possible danger signs to watch for.\nIf you are troubled by headaches after your head injury, your doctor may suggest that you try acetaminophen (Tylenol) first. If this does not work, your doctor probably will prescribe a stronger pain reliever. It's safest to avoid aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) unless your doctor recommends it, since these drugs might increase the risk of bleeding inside the head.\nIn people with more extensive head injuries, treatment depends on the type of injury, its severity, and its location. For example, the person may need treatment in an intensive care unit for close monitoring of brain function and blood pressure, as well as seizure prevention. Surgery may be performed to repair a depressed skull fracture, drain an epidural or subdural hematoma, or treat a brain hemorrhage or contusion.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call for emergency help immediately if you find someone unconscious at an accident scene. Also call for emergency help if someone with a serious head injury experiences any of the following symptoms:\nEven if your head injury appears to be less severe, and your symptoms are mild, it may be possible that you have had significant damage to the brain or its surrounding structures. This is especially true if you:\nIf you have one or more of the risk factors listed above, call a doctor or go to an emergency department immediately if you have a head injury.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the severity of the injury:\n",

      "What are they?": "Head lice are small, parasitic insects that infest hair on the head of people. Their six legs allow them to grasp and wander between hairs. They feed only on the blood of people, and feed once or more each day. They are more common on children than adults.\nIn general, a person infested with head lice will have fewer than a dozen live lice on his or her head at a time, although hundreds of developing, dead and hatched eggs may be present. A single insect is called a louse. A female louse can lay more than 100 eggs, called nits, in her lifetime. The female louse secretes a glue to attach each egg to a scalp hair, usually close to scalp level. They hatch about 8 days after they are laid, and grow to the adult stage about 9 to 12 days after hatching. Adult head lice survive just a few weeks on the scalp, but die within a day once removed from a person.\n\nImage: Ivan Mattioli/Getty Images\n",
      "Symptoms": "The most common symptom of a head lice infestation is itching. This is caused mainly by the louse's saliva, which irritates the skin on the scalp. The itching can occasionally be severe enough to prevent sleep, and some people scratch so much that they cause additional skin infections. Head lice are not known to transmit any infections.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Because itching on the scalp may result from many causes other than head lice, a medical professional should diagnose a head-lice infestation, and this should be based on the finding of a live (crawling) louse. Louse infestations may be difficult to identify properly, since lice and their eggs are often hard to distinguish from other materials caught in the hair, such as dandruff, scabs, dirt or insects blown in by wind. In general, only those people with live (crawling) head lice should be treated. The eggs or nits of the louse appear as small white, tan or brown dots attached firmly to individual hairs. If nits are seen, then live lice should be sought before considering treatment.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Head lice sometimes go away on their own because there are not enough insects to maintain the infestation, or they may persist for an indefinite period without treatment. With proper treatment, the infestation usually goes away within about two weeks.\n",
      "Prevention": "Head lice are acquired by direct contact with an infested person's hair. Only rarely would lice be transferred by shared combs, brushes, hats or other hair accessories.\nIt is not necessary to isolate infested people or keep children with head lice home from school. Head lice neither are caused by, nor a sign of, poor hygiene or housekeeping.\n",
      "Treatment": "There are several treatment options to eliminate head lice. In some cases, several methods can be used together to ensure success. First, make sure you have seen a live louse. Do not treat if you've only seen objects you believe to be louse eggs (nits). If you find a live louse on one person in the home, then inspect all other adults and children for lice as well.\nIf the hair can be combed easily, then you can use a special louse comb or nit comb to remove lice and their eggs from the hair. This sometimes requires combing several times a week until no lice are seen for two or more weeks. Although combing alone may eliminate lice from some people, this method fails for others. If the process requires too much time or causes discomfort, then it is not a good option for treatment.\nTopical pediculicides applied to the scalp or skin are special insecticide products (registered by the Food and Drug Administration) that are available over the counter. Do not apply any other kind of insecticide to the body or hair. Carefully read and follow the instructions on the product. Do not overtreat. If you have any questions about the use of the product, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.\nMost topical pediculicides contain a class of chemicals called pyrethroids as the active ingredient. These usually are applied as a shampoo then washed off about 10 minutes later. A second treatment is often necessary, about 10 days later. Malathion and spinosad are two other effective topical pediculicides.\nAnother over-the-counter topical treatment is Sklice, a single-use lotion with ivermectin 0.5% as the active ingredient. It's approved for patients age 6 months and older. Follow the directions; be sure your scalp and hair are dry before you apply it.\nAlthough these products work very well for many infestations, some head lice are resistant to them. If live (crawling) head lice are discovered a day after treatment, speak with your doctor about other kinds of treatments.\nDo not apply products that are not registered by the FDA as pediculicides. These include many kinds of essential oils, enzyme treatments, antibiotics, vegetable oils, or heat. Such treatments may waste time, money and effort, or may even harm the person being treated.\nAlthough head lice are only rarely found on clothes, towels and bed linens, you may want to launder or change any items that were in direct contact with the hair of the infested person during the last day or so. Washing items in hot water or drying them in high heat will kill lice and their eggs. Because head lice do not survive long once they are removed from a person, there is no need to clean or vacuum the home environment intensively.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you are not certain that you or your child has head lice or you have any questions about over-the-counter treatments, talk with the pharmacist or call your doctor's office. If you are unsure if the objects you see are lice or eggs, then you should have these examined before you treat.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for recovery from head-lice infestation is excellent. Head lice do not transmit other types of infections, nor do they produce symptoms other than itching. Active infestations that are treated according to directions will soon be eliminated.\n",

      "What is it?": "Headaches can be divided into two main types: primary headache and secondary headache.\nPrimary headache includes\nTypically, tension-type headaches cause mild to moderate pain, usually on both sides of the head. There is a pressing or tightening sensation. It is not pulsating and is not accompanied by nausea. The headache does not get worse with routine physical activity.\nThe typical migraine headache is throbbing or pulsating, and often is associated with nausea and changes in vision. While many migraine headaches are severe, not all severe headaches are migraines, and some episodes of migraine can be quite mild. Most people who have migraine experience repeated attacks of headaches that occur over many years.\nCluster headaches are very intense headaches. They usually start in the area around one eye, then spread to nearby areas of the face. Each headache lasts about a half-hour to three hours. Episodes can occur several times over 24 hours (in clusters). This happens daily, lasting several weeks to months. Cluster headaches are much more likely to happen in men than women.\nThere are many potential reasons for secondary headache. Here are some examples:\n",
      "Symptoms": "By definition, a headache is a pain in the head. But the type, location, and severity of pain are highly variable. And for migraine, there can be profound symptoms without a headache.\nA person can simultaneously have multiple reasons for headaches. It's common for a person to have both migraine and tension-type headaches. And the symptoms of tension-type headaches and migraine headaches can overlap. For example, both types of headaches may be made worse by bright lights or loud noises.\nIn general, migraine headaches tend to throb. Tension-type headaches tend to cause a more constant pain. But the pain of either a migraine or a tension-type headache can be steady or throbbing, or can alternate between the two.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Most often, people can make a self-diagnosis of a tension-type headache or migraine. However, the onset of a new, very severe headache should prompt an urgent visit for clinical evaluation. The doctor will often be able to make the diagnosis based on your description of the headache, your medical history, and the results of a physical examination.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head may be ordered. These imaging tests may be used to investigate headache pain that is associated with unexpected or unusual symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Headaches can last from a few minutes to an entire day, and even for many consecutive days.\nA chronic headache or persistent migraine can last for part or all of the day for most days of the week. The pain can also be continuous. The intensity of pain may fluctuate during that time.\n",
      "Prevention": "Relaxation techniques and avoidance of stressful situations may help to prevent headaches. Many things can trigger a headache. Identifying and correcting one or more triggers may reduce headache frequency and severity.\nPeople with frequent or severe migraine attacks often benefit from taking preventive medication daily. Examples include\n",
      "Treatment": "For infrequent headaches, over-the-counter pain relievers are convenient, effective, and relatively safe. Examples include aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve). Some people get more pain relief with combination pain relievers that contain caffeine.\nTo be most effective, a pain-reliever medicine should be taken immediately when the headache starts.\nThe use of any over-the-counter pain reliever should be limited to no more than two or three days per week. If pain medications are used more frequently than that, \"rebound\" headaches may occur on the days that medications are not taken.\nTo abort a migraine, several prescription drugs are available:\nIn addition, people who experience nausea with a migraine (with or without vomiting) can also take an anti-nausea pill or suppository.\nFrequent episodic and chronic headaches are more difficult to treat. Rebound headaches are common when pain relievers are stopped. Therapy to prevent the headache before it starts is a better strategy than taking pain relievers after the headache is present. There are several medications that can break the cycle of recurrent headaches, such as naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve, generic versions) and amitriptyline (Elavil, generic versions).\nSome people are able to treat their headaches without medications. You can apply an ice pack or heating pad to any tight areas in the neck and shoulders. You can also try massaging the area.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Most headaches are harmless. It's reassuring if you are able to relieve your headaches without medications or with only occasional use of a pain reliever.\nHeadaches are rarely caused by a serious medical problem. However, you should call or visit your doctor if you have\n",
      "Prognosis": "Infrequent episodic headaches can usually be treated successfully with pain-relieving medication. But finding the right combination of therapies to relieve frequent episodic and chronic headaches may take several months. Over time, most people will have fewer and less severe headaches.\n",

      "What is it?": "A heart attack occurs when one of the heart's coronary arteries is blocked suddenly or has extremely slow blood flow. A heart attack also is called a myocardial infarction.\nThe usual cause of sudden blockage in a coronary artery is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus). The blood clot typically forms inside a coronary artery that already has been narrowed by atherosclerosis, a condition in which fatty deposits (plaques) build up along the inside walls of blood vessels.\n\nSlow blood flow in a coronary artery can happen when the heart is beating very fast or the person has low blood pressure. If the demand for oxygen is greater than the supply, a heart attack can happen without formation of a blood clot. People with atherosclerosis are also more likely to have this reason for a heart attack.\nEach coronary artery supplies blood to a specific part of the heart's muscular wall, so a blocked artery causes pain and malfunction in the area it supplies. Depending on the location and amount of heart muscle involved, this malfunction can seriously interfere with the heart's ability to pump blood. Also, some of the coronary arteries supply areas of the heart that regulate heartbeat, so a blockage sometimes causes potentially fatal abnormal heartbeats, called cardiac arrhythmias.\nThe pattern of symptoms that develops with each heart attack and the chances of survival are linked to the location and extent of the coronary artery blockage.\nMost heart attacks result from atherosclerosis. The risk factors for heart attack and atherosclerosis are basically the same:\nIn early middle age, men have a greater risk of heart attack than women. However, a woman's risk increases once she begins menopause. This could be the result of a menopause-related decrease in levels of estrogen, a female sex hormone that may offer some protection against atherosclerosis.\nAlthough most heart attacks are caused by atherosclerosis, there are rarer cases in which heart attacks result from other medical conditions. These include congenital abnormalities of the coronary arteries, dissection of a coronary artery, hypercoagulability (an abnormally increased tendency to form blood clots), a collagen vascular disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus), cocaine abuse, a spasm of the coronary artery, or an embolus (small traveling blood clot), which floats into a coronary artery and lodges there.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The most common symptom of a heart attack is chest pain, usually described as crushing, squeezing, pressing, heavy, or occasionally, stabbing or burning. Chest pain tends to be focused either in the center of the chest or just below the center of the rib cage, and it can spread to the arms, abdomen, neck, lower jaw or neck.\nOther symptoms can include sudden weakness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, or lightheadedness. Sometimes, when a heart attack causes burning chest pain, nausea and vomiting, a patient may mistake his or her heart symptoms for indigestion.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you to describe your chest pain and any other symptoms. Ideally, a family member or close friend should accompany you when you go for medical treatment. This person can help to provide your doctor with valuable information about your symptoms and medical history if you are unable to do so.\nIt is also important to give your doctor a list of the names and dosages of the prescription and nonprescription medications that you are taking. If you don't have a list already prepared, just scoop the medicines into a nearby bag or purse and bring them with you to the hospital.\nYour doctor will suspect that you are having a heart attack based on your symptoms, your medical history and your risk factors for cardiovascular disease. To confirm the diagnosis, he or she will do:\nAdditional tests may be needed, including:\n\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long heart attack symptoms last varies from person to person. In about 15% of cases, the patient never reaches a hospital for treatment and dies quickly after symptoms begin.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent a heart attack by:\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of a heart attack depends on how stable the person's condition is and his or her immediate risk of death. As soon as possible, the person will receive an aspirin and often other medicines that help prevent unwanted blood clotting in the coronary arteries.\nThe person also will be given oxygen to breathe, pain medication (usually morphine) for chest pain, beta-blockers to reduce the heart's demand for oxygen, nitroglycerin to help blood flow into heart muscle cells, and a cholesterol-lowering statin drug. The person may be started on heparin in addition to aspirin for more potent anti-clotting action.\nDuring the initial evaluation, the person will be considered for reperfusion therapy. The goal is to restore blood flow to the injured heart muscle as soon as possible to limit permanent damage.\nReperfusion is best done mechanically. The patient is taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the hospital. A catheter is threaded through a large blood vessel toward the heart. Dye is injected to locate the blockage in the coronary artery.\nThe next step is percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In PTCA, a different catheter that has a small deflated balloon is threaded past the blockage, and the balloon is inflated to crush the clot and plaque. Most balloon catheters also have a wire mesh, called a stent, over the balloon. After the balloon is inflated to unclog the blocked artery, the stent remains in place to keep the artery open.\nIn addition to aspirin, a second anti-platelet drug is given. The ones used most commonly are clopidogrel (Plavix, generic versions), prasugrel (Effient) and ticagrelor (Brilinta).\nReperfusion therapy can also be done with clot-dissolving drugs called thrombolytic agents, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This drug is used if it would take too long to transfer a patient to a hospital where an angioplasty could be performed.\nMuch of the additional treatment for heart attack depends on whether the patient developed any complications. For example, additional drugs may be needed to treat dangerous cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats), low blood pressure, and congestive heart failure.\nWhile in the hospital, daily medications usually include aspirin, a beta-blocker, an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor to help the heart work more efficiently, primarily by lowering blood pressure, a statin and a second anti-clotting drug.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Seek emergency help immediately if you have chest pain, even if you think it is just indigestion or that you are too young to be having a heart attack. Prompt treatment increases your chance of limiting heart muscle damage. That's because reperfusion measures work best if they are started as soon as possible after symptoms start.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Survival from a heart attack has improved dramatically over the last two decades. However, some people experience sudden death and never make it to the hospital. For most people that do reach the hospital soon after the onset of symptoms, the prognosis is very good. Many people leave the hospital feeling well with limited heart damage.\n",

      "What is it?": "Heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump efficiently enough to meet the body's need for blood. Contrary to its name, heart failure does not mean the heart has failed completely. Heart failure is also called congestive heart failure.\nThe inefficient pumping associated with heart failure causes a backup of blood in the veins leading to the heart. It causes the kidneys to retain fluid. As a result, the body's tissues swell.\nThe swelling most commonly affects the legs. But it also can occur in other tissues and organs. When it occurs in the lungs, it causes breathing difficulty.\nHeart failure often is the end stage of another form of heart disease. Its many causes include:\nHyperthyroidism, diabetes and prolonged lung disease also increase the risk of heart failure.\nIn some people with heart failure, the heart muscle becomes weaker. It cannot pump as well. In other people, the heart muscle becomes stiff. As a result, the heart cannot fill with enough blood between heartbeats.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The first symptom of heart failure often is fatigue. As the condition worsens, shortness of breath and wheezing occur during exertion. Eventually, shortness of breath and wheezing occur when you are resting. As fluid accumulates in the lungs, people with heart failure may begin to sleep propped up with pillows. This makes breathing easier. There also can be a chronic cough due to fluid accumulation in the lungs.\nFluid also can collect in the legs and ankles, causing swelling. In people who are less active, collected fluid can accumulate in the middle of the body. Some people urinate several times during the night as the kidneys drain off some of this excess fluid. As the body accumulates more and more fluid, the person may experience significant weight gain.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Heart failure usually affects both sides of the heart. But in some people it affects only one side. When heart failure affects mainly the left side of the heart, the symptoms are more likely to involve breathing difficulties. When mainly the right side is affected, the main symptoms may be leg swelling and abdominal swelling.\nYour doctor will review your medical history and ask for details about your symptoms. For example, he or she may ask:\nDuring your physical examination, your doctor will:\nYou also will have diagnostic tests. An electrocardiogram and chest X-ray will check for enlargement of the heart and fluid in the lungs.\nOther diagnostic tests may be needed to find the cause of your heart failure. For example, an echocardiogram may be done to look for heart valve abnormalities, signs of heart attack, or other cardiac abnormalities.\nThe echocardiogram is particularly important. It can determine whether the heart muscles have weakened or become stiff. Treatment can differ depending on the type of heart failure.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Heart failure often is a lifelong condition.\nHowever, if the cause is treatable, heart failure can go away.\n",
      "Prevention": "To avoid heart failure, you must prevent the various forms of heart disease that lead to it.\nTo prevent heart disease:\nSome types of heart failure cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of heart failure focuses on:\nTo accomplish these goals, your doctor will advise a low-salt diet and medication.\nMedications may include:\nYour doctor also will address the underlying cause of your heart failure. Heart failure related to coronary artery disease may require additional medications, angioplasty or surgery. When heart failure is caused by a poorly functioning heart valve, your doctor may advise surgical repair and valve replacement.\nFor some heart failure patients, losing weight or avoiding alcohol can dramatically improve symptoms. Your doctor will tell you how much exercise is appropriate. Balancing physical activity with rest is important in more advanced stages of heart failure.\nEventually medications and self-treatment may no longer be helpful. At this point, a heart transplant may be considered. This treatment option is limited by a shortage of donor hearts. It usually is reserved for patients younger than 65.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms, particularly if you already have been diagnosed with heart disease:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on:\nWhen heart failure develops suddenly and has a treatable cause, people sometimes can regain normal heart function after treatment.\nWith appropriate treatment, even people who develop heart failure as a result of long-standing heart disease often can enjoy many years of productive life.\n",

      "What Is It?": "A heart murmur is a sound made by turbulent blood flow within the heart. Your doctor hears this sound with a stethoscope. A murmur can occur in a normal heart. Or it may indicate some problem within the heart.\nMost often, the turbulence is normal. And the sound is called a benign flow murmur. It happens when blood flows faster through the heart, for example in a person who is anxious, has just finished exercising, has a high fever or has severe anemia. About 10% of adults and 30% of children (most between the ages of 3 and 7) have a harmless murmur produced by a normal heart. This type of murmur is also called an innocent murmur.\nA heart murmur may indicate a structural abnormality of a heart valve or heart chamber, or it may be due to an abnormal connection between two parts of the heart. Some abnormalities of the heart that create heart murmurs include:\n\n\nCongenital heart problems– Congenital means the disorder was present at birth. Congenital heart problems include:\n",
      "Symptoms": "An innocent murmur does not cause any symptoms. For other types of heart murmurs, symptoms vary depending on the cause. In general, when a heart murmur significantly interferes with the heart's ability to pump blood, you can experience one or more of the following symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Many murmurs are discovered unexpectedly when a doctor listens to someone's heart with a stethoscope during a routine physical exam. In other cases, when someone is having symptoms of heart problems, the doctor will ask questions related to a specific type of heart ailment. For example, he or she may ask about a history of rheumatic fever because rheumatic fever during childhood can cause heart valve abnormalities later in life. Because endocarditis can follow intravenous drug use or certain medical or dental procedures, your doctor may ask about these risk factors. If the patient is an infant, the doctor will ask whether there is a family history of congenital heart problems.\nBecause specific heart problems are associated with specific types of murmurs, your doctor often will make a tentative diagnosis based on your medical history, symptoms and the murmur's distinctive sound and timing (whether the murmur occurs when the heart is pumping or resting). As part of your medical evaluation, your doctor may order diagnostic tests, which may include:\n",
      "Expected Duration": "When an innocent heart murmur is triggered by fever, anxiety or exertion, it can disappear after the condition that triggered it goes away. In healthy children with more constant innocent murmurs, the murmur often becomes softer as the child grows and can eventually disappear completely.\nWhen a murmur is caused by a heart problem, how long it lasts depends on the type of disorder. For example, some forms of endocarditis begin suddenly and get worse rapidly over a few days, while others cause milder symptoms over weeks or months. Murmurs caused by valve problems or congenital heart problems usually last throughout life, and in some cases, they can worsen over time.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent the congenital heart defects that cause some heart murmurs.\nIf you are at high risk of endocarditis, your doctor or dentist will prescribe special antibiotics before doing any medical or dental procedure during which bacteria could enter your blood and infect your heart. You also can help to prevent endocarditis by avoiding intravenous drug use.\nYou can prevent many heart-valve abnormalities by preventing rheumatic fever. To do this, take antibiotics exactly as prescribed whenever you have strep throat.\nPeople who already have had one episode of rheumatic fever may need to take antibiotics for up to 10 years after the first attack to prevent the disease from returning.\n",
      "Treatment": "Innocent heart murmurs do not need to be treated. Other types of murmurs that do not cause any symptoms also may not require any treatment, although your doctor should monitor them regularly. When treatment is required, it varies depending on the cause of the murmur.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call your doctor if you begin to experience:\nShortness of breath\nPersistent light-headedness\nEpisodes of rapid or irregular heartbeat\nChest pain\n",
      "Prognosis": "In people with innocent heart murmurs, the prognosis is excellent. For people with other types of heart murmurs, the prognosis depends on the type of heart problem and its severity. In general, even when heart surgery is required, the prognosis is good.\n",

      "What is it?": "The heart has four valves – the aortic, mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Like valves used in house plumbing, the heart valves open to allow fluid (blood) to be pumped forward, and they close to prevent fluid from flowing backward. Human heart valves are flaps of tissue called leaflets or cusps.\nHeart valve problems fall into two major categories:\nHeart valve problems can be congenital, which means present at birth, or acquired after birth. A heart valve problem is classified as congenital when some factor during fetal development causes the valve to form abnormally. Congenital heart valve disease affects about 1 in 1,000 newborns. Most of these infants have stenosis of either the pulmonary or the aortic valve.\nA heart valve problem is acquired if it occurs in a valve that was structurally normal at birth. Some causes of acquired heart valve problems include:\nHeart valve problems affect each valve in a slightly different way.\nAortic valveThe aortic valve opens to allow blood to pass from the left ventricle to the aorta, the massive blood vessel that directs oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Disorders of this valve include:\nAortic valve problems in adults are more common in men than women.\nMitral valveThe mitral valve opens to allow blood to pass from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Disorders of this valve include:\nPulmonary valveThe pulmonary valve, or pulmonic valve, is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. It allows oxygen-poor blood to flow from the right side of the heart to the lungs for oxygenation. Disorders of this valve include:\nTricuspid valveThe tricuspid valve allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Disorders of this valve include:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Many people with mild heart valve problems do not have any symptoms, and the abnormal valve is discovered only when a heart murmur is heard during a physical examination. For more severe heart valve problems, symptoms vary slightly depending on which valve is involved.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If you are having symptoms, your doctor will begin by evaluating your risk of heart valve problems. Your doctor will ask questions about your family history of heart problems; your personal history of rheumatic fever, syphilis, hypertension, arteriosclerosis or connective tissue disorders; and your risk of endocarditis caused by intravenous (IV) drug use or a recent medical or dental procedure. If the patient is an infant, the doctor will ask about the mother's health or environmental risk factors during pregnancy.\nYour doctor may suspect that you have a heart valve problem based on your specific symptoms and medical history. To support the diagnosis, your doctor will examine you, paying special attention to your heart. Your doctor will evaluate the size of your heart (to check for enlargement) and use a stethoscope to listen for heart murmurs. Because specific heart valve problems produce specific types of heart murmurs, your doctor often can make a tentative diagnosis based on your murmur's distinctive sound and whether the murmur occurs when the heart is contracting (a systolic murmur) or relaxing (a diastolic murmur).\nTo confirm the diagnosis of a heart valve problem and to evaluate its effects on your heart, your doctor will order diagnostic tests. Initial testing usually includes an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiogram. Additional testing may include a chest X-ray, blood tests to check for infection in patients with suspected endocarditis, and sometimes cardiac catheterization.\n",
      "Expected duration": "In general, heart valve problems often persist throughout life and may gradually worsen with time. Those caused by endocarditis sometimes may produce severe symptoms and rapid deterioration within a few days.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent the majority of congenital heart valve problems. Pregnant women should have regularly scheduled prenatal care and should avoid using alcohol.\nYou can prevent certain acquired heart valve abnormalities by preventing rheumatic fever. To do this, take antibiotics exactly as prescribed whenever you have strep throat.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have a mild heart valve problem without any symptoms, your doctor may simply monitor your condition.\nIf you have moderate or severe symptoms, your treatment will be determined by the severity of your symptoms and the results of diagnostic tests. Although your doctor can give you medications to temporarily treat symptoms such as angina, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure, you eventually may need to have the abnormal valve repaired or replaced. This can be done in several different ways:\n\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you begin to experience any symptoms that may be related to a heart problem, especially shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid or irregular heartbeat, or fainting spells.\nIf you have been diagnosed with a heart valve problem, ask your doctor whether you are at risk of endocarditis. If so, you will need to take antibiotics before undergoing any medical or dental procedure in which bacteria may enter your blood and infect your abnormal valve.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Among patients who undergo surgical treatments for heart valve problems, the major risks occur during and immediately after surgery. After that, the outlook is usually excellent. People that have had surgery are at higher risk of developing an infection on the heart valve (endocarditis) throughout life.\n",

      "What is it?": "Sometimes a natural heart valve that is not working properly needs to be replaced surgically with a prosthetic valve. A prosthetic valve is a synthetic or tissue substitute for the natural valve. It is designed to mimic the natural valve's normal opening and closing motions. A prosthetic valve can replace any of the heart valves – mitral, aortic, pulmonary or tricuspid. Prosthetic heart valves are divided into two basic categories: synthetic mechanical valves and biological valves, which are usually made of animal tissue.\n",
      "Mechanical valves": "Several different forms of mechanical valves are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in hospitals in the United States. The different types vary in the mechanisms they use to open and close the valves.\nIn general, mechanical valves tend to last longer than biological valves, but they also carry a greater long-term risk of thromboembolism, which is a floating blood clot that can travel through the circulation, causing stroke and other problems. To help prevent thromboembolism, people who receive mechanical heart valves must take anticoagulant medications (anticlotting drugs) for the rest of their lives. However, this long-term use of anticoagulants also increases the risk of bleeding problems.\nAlthough mechanical valves generally are used in younger patients because of their durability, the need for anticoagulant medication can complicate a pregnancy in young women.\n",
      "Biological valves": "Several different forms of mechanical valves are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in hospitals in the United States. The different types vary in the mechanisms they use to open and close the valves.\nIn general, mechanical valves tend to last longer than biological valves, but they also carry a greater long-term risk of thromboembolism, which is a floating blood clot that can travel through the circulation, causing stroke and other problems. To help prevent thromboembolism, people who receive mechanical heart valves must take anticoagulant medications (anticlotting drugs) for the rest of their lives. However, this long-term use of anticoagulants also increases the risk of bleeding problems.\nAlthough mechanical valves generally are used in younger patients because of their durability, the need for anticoagulant medication can complicate a pregnancy in young women.\n\n",
      "What it's used for": "The reasons for a heart valve replacement vary slightly, depending on which of the four heart valves is involved. As a general guide, however, you may need a valve replacement for any of the following reasons:\n",
      "Preparation": "Your preparation will include a thorough cardiac evaluation with a physical examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiography. In some cases, exercise testing, cardiac catheterization or a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be necessary as well. Routine blood tests also will be done to evaluate your kidney function and to check for anemia and other blood-related problems.\n",
      "How it's done": "",
      "Traditional valve replacement surgery": "An intravenous (IV) line will be inserted into your arm to deliver fluids and medications, and you will be given general anesthesia. With traditional heart valve surgery, a large incision will be made in the midline of your chest. The surgeon will need to cut through your breastbone to expose the heart. After your heart is exposed, you will be placed on a heart-lung machine, a machine that oxygenates and pumps your blood during surgery. Your heart will be cooled and stopped temporarily. Once your heart is motionless, the surgeon will cut through its muscular wall to remove the malfunctioning heart valve, insert the prosthetic valve, and stitch it into place.\nAfter closing the incision in your heart wall, the surgeon will begin to warm your heart. If your heart does not start to beat again on its own after it has returned to normal temperature, the surgeon may need to trigger the heartbeat with an electric shock. Once it is clear that your heart is pumping steadily without leaking blood, you will be disconnected from the heart-lung machine. The surgeon will use wires to reattach the halves of your breastbone, your chest incision will be stitched closed, and you will be taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit.\nFor some patients, the heart surgeon is able to repair or replace a heart valve through a smaller incision.\nAfter one or two days in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit, you will be transferred to a regular hospital room. There you will continue to be monitored with daily blood tests and EKGs until you are stable enough to go home. Depending on your doctor's routine treatment strategy, you may either have another echocardiogram before you are discharged from the hospital, or you will have one as an outpatient.\n",
      "Transcatheter insertion of artificial heart valves": "New technologies allow artificial valves to be inserted into the heart via special catheters, without opening the patient's chest.\nA procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an increasingly popular alternative for people with moderate to severe aortic stenosis.\nIn a TAVR procedure, a replacement aortic valve made of pig or cow tissue is crimped onto a deflated balloon and placed at the tip of a thin, flexible tube (catheter). The doctor inserts the catheter into a blood vessel at the top of the thigh and threads it up to the opening between the heart and the aorta.Once it reaches the diseased aortic valve, the device expands and anchors to the old valve.\n",
      "Follow-up": "After your heart valve replacement, you will need to take anticoagulant medication indefinitely if you have a mechanical valve, or for about three months if you have a biological valve. Your doctor, or your doctor's assistant, will work with you to determine an anticoagulant dose that is high enough to prevent thromboembolism but low enough to prevent bleeding problems. Also, for the rest of your life you will need to take antibiotics prior to having certain high-risk dental or medical procedures. These antibiotics will help to prevent infection of your prosthetic valve, if the high-risk procedure allows bacteria to stray into your bloodstream.\nAfter discharge, your doctor will ask you to return for a follow-up visit within 3 to 4 weeks. If you are feeling well at that visit, and the results of your repeat echocardiography are good, your doctor will schedule future visits at 3-month or 12-month intervals.\n",
      "Risks": "Mechanical heart valves that have been approved by the FDA rarely fail. However, even when patients take enough anticoagulants, a small number develop blood clots on the valves. Each year, 1.3% to 2.7% of patients who have a mechanical heart valve experience an episode of severe bleeding related to anticoagulants.\nBiological valves tend to fail over time — requiring replacement in 30% of patients within 10 years and 50% within 15 years. However, the risk of blood clots is very low.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "After your discharge, call your doctor immediately if:\n",

      "What is it?": "The human body usually can regulate its temperature. When the body gets too hot, it uses several strategies to cool down, including sweating. But if a person spends too much time in the heat without taking in enough fluids, the body's cooling processes can't work properly. When the body becomes dehydrated, it can no longer cool itself by sweating. When this happens, body temperature can rise high enough to make the person sick.\nThe first symptoms of heat illness occur as the body temperature climbs above normal, and can include headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps and fatigue. These early symptoms sometimes are called heat exhaustion. If steps are not taken to reduce body temperature, heat exhaustion can worsen and become heat stroke.\nHeat stroke is a serious, potentially life-threatening form of heat illness. The body temperature rises to 105 degrees Fahrenheit or higher and you develop neurological changes, such as mental confusion or unconsciousness. At these high temperatures, body proteins and the membranes around the cells in the body, especially in the brain, begin to be destroyed or malfunction. The extreme heat can affect internal organs, causing breakdown of the heart muscle cells and blood vessels, damage to internal organs, and death. There are two main causes of heat stroke:\nFactors that can contribute to heat stroke include:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Heat stroke can come on suddenly, but warning symptoms often appear first. They include:\nWhen heat stroke starts, neurological symptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A doctor will examine the person and do tests to check for other possible causes of the high temperature. Tests may include a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, blood tests and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).\nThe doctor also will do urine and blood tests to monitor how well the kidneys are functioning. Dehydration and heat stroke can be a major stress for the kidneys.\n",
      "Expected duration": "It is standard for a person with heat stroke to stay in the hospital for one or more days so that any complications can be identified quickly. Complete recovery from heat stroke and its effects on body organs may take two months to a year.\n",
      "Prevention": "Most cases of heat stroke can be prevented. When the temperature outside is especially high:\nIf you begin to feel tired, dizzy or nauseated, or if you develop a headache, get out of the heat immediately. Seek out an air-conditioned building. Drink water. If possible, take a cool shower or bath or use a hose to soak yourself.\n",
      "Treatment": "The first step in treating heat stroke is to reduce body temperature by cooling the body from the outside. This can be done by removing tight or unnecessary clothing, spraying the person with water, blowing cool air on the person, or wrapping the person loosely in wet sheets. Alternatively, ice packs can be placed at the neck, groin and armpits to accelerate cooling.\nSevere cases may require cardiopulmonary bypass, in which the person's blood is diverted from the heart and lungs into a collection machine, cooled, and then returned to the body.\nIn some cases, anti-seizure or muscle-relaxing medications may be given to control convulsions and shivering. Aspirin and acetaminophen (Tylenol) do not help lower body temperature when a person has heat stroke, and these medications should be avoided if heat stroke is suspected.\nPeople with heat stroke generally need to be hospitalized so they can be tested for complications that may appear after the first day. One common complication is muscle breakdown caused by the heat. In this condition, called rhabdomyolysis, byproducts of the muscle breakdown appear in the bloodstream and can damage the kidneys.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Seek emergency help if you or someone else has been in the heat and experiences confusion, faintness, staggering, hallucinations (visions that are not real), unusual agitation or coma. Begin cooling the person immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If medical help is sought quickly, heat stroke almost always is treated successfully. Having had heat stroke in the past increases your risk of heat stroke in the future, so you will have to take extra precautions in hot weather. Delaying treatment can have serious consequences, including kidney or liver damage, congestive heart failure or heart arrhythmias, coma or death.\n",

      "What is hematuria?": "Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine. If there are enough red cells, the urine can become bright red, pink or cola colored. Often, however, the urine appears completely normal because there is not enough blood to cause a color change. In this case, the condition is called \"microscopic\" hematuria.\nThere are many possible causes of hematuria, including:\n",
      "Symptoms of hematuria": "By itself, hematuria rarely causes symptoms. One exception is when the bladder has so much blood in it that clots form, and the flow of urine is blocked. This can cause pain at the site of the blockage in the lower pelvis. Symptoms usually come from the cause of the hematuria, and vary depending on the condition:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your health care professional will want a sample of your urine to confirm that you have hematuria. In women, blood can get into the urine during menstruation. Your doctor may want to repeat the urine test between periods.\nOnce your doctor has confirmed that you have hematuria, he or she will ask about your medical history and your family's medical history, especially any history of kidney disease, bladder problems or bleeding disorders. Your doctor also will ask about any recent trauma or strenuous exercise, recent viral or bacterial infections, the medications you take, and your symptoms, including more frequent urination, pain with urination and pain in your side.\nYour doctor also will examine you. He or she will take your temperature and blood pressure, and will see if you have pain or discomfort in your side or over your bladder. The doctor may recommend that women undergo a pelvic examination, and men undergo a prostate examination.\nYour doctor will ask you for a fresh urine sample for a urinalysis. Urine is analyzed in the laboratory to look for protein, white cells and red cells to identify a kidney or bladder infection, or kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis).\nThen, depending on the suspected cause of your hematuria, additional testing may include:\n\nAdditional testing for conditions causing kidney inflammation (such as lupus) may be recommended, depending on the findings of the routine blood and urine tests.\n",
      "Expected duration of hematuria": "How long hematuria lasts depends on its underlying cause. For example, hematuria related to strenuous exercise typically goes away on its own within 24 to 48 hours. Hematuria resulting from a urinary tract infection will end when the infection is cured. Hematuria related to a kidney stone will clear after the stone is passed or removed.\n",
      "Preventing hematuria": "To prevent hematuria related to strenuous exercise, switch to a less-intense exercise program. In general, you can help to prevent other forms of hematuria by following a lifestyle that fosters a healthy urinary tract:\n",
      "Treating hematuria": "The treatment of hematuria depends on its cause. In general, people with exercise-related hematuria do not need any treatment other than to modify their exercise programs. People with drug-related hematuria will improve if they stop taking the medication that caused the problem. Antibiotics typically will cure infection-related hematuria. For other causes of hematuria, treatment may be more complex:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you notice blood in your urine or if your urine turns the color of cola. You should also call your health care professional if you have fever or pain in the lower abdomen or side.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people whose hematuria is related to exercise, medication, kidney stones, urinary tract infection or prostatitis have an excellent outlook for complete recovery.\nChildren with hematuria resulting from glomerulonephritis usually recover completely if their illness is mild or if it develops after a strep infection. Adults with glomerulonephritis are less likely to recover on their own, although the outlook depends on the specific type of glomerulonephritis. More severe forms of the disease eventually can lead to chronic kidney failure.\nFor people with kidney or bladder cancer, the outlook depends on the stage and type of tumor. In general, if a kidney or bladder tumor is diagnosed early, the cancer often can be cured.\nAlthough people with hemophilia may have repeated bleeding episodes (including bleeding into joints, internal organs and other parts of the body), recent advances in treatment have achieved a near-normal lifespan for many patients.\n",

      "What is it?": "Hemochromatosis is a common genetic (inherited) disorder in which too much iron is absorbed from the digestive tract. This excess iron is deposited in the tissues and organs of the body, where it can become toxic and cause damage.\nHemochromatosis occurs most often in people of northern European ancestry, especially those of Scottish, Irish or English descent, and affects up to 1 in 200 people in the United States. Hemochromatosis most commonly is diagnosed in people between ages 40 and 60. In women, it usually is diagnosed after menopause.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The early symptoms of hemochromatosis vary a lot from person to person and are general symptoms that also occur in other conditions. In fact, there may be no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Symptoms include:\nAs the condition progresses, your skin may take on a bronze or yellowish color. The disease can lead to organ failure, especially liver failure (cirrhosis), which can cause confusion, bleeding, fluid accumulation in the legs and abdomen, black or bloody stools, and jaundice. Deposits of iron in the heart can cause heart failure or an irregular heartbeat. If the pancreas is involved, you also can develop diabetes, which can cause frequent urination and excessive thirst.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you details about your medical history, will examine you, and will order several tests to measure the amount of iron in your blood. A liver biopsy may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis. In this procedure, you will receive a local anesthetic and a small piece of tissue from your liver will be removed for analysis in a laboratory. Some experts recommend that all adults have a test to measure the amount of iron in the blood as a screen for this disorder. However, there is no general agreement that this approach is useful.\nGenetic testing is available for some of the more common genes associated with this disorder (found in up to 90% of people with hemochromatosis), but not everyone who has the genes develops the disease. For people with an abnormally high level of iron in the blood and a positive genetic test, liver biopsy may be unnecessary.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver can also assist in making the diagnosis. The test can measure the amount of iron in the liver. A very high level strongly suggests hemochromatosis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Hemochromatosis is a lifelong condition.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent hemochromatosis, because the disorder is inherited. However, complications of the disease, including cirrhosis, arthritis, heart failure and diabetes, may be prevented by early detection and treatment. Avoiding supplemental iron (as contained in supplements and many vitamins) and high doses of vitamin C (which frees iron to deposit in the tissues) also may help to prevent complications of iron overload.\nFamily members of anyone diagnosed with hemochromatosis should be screened for the condition.\nPeople with hemochromatosis should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B, and should avoid substances that can injure the liver, such as too much acetaminophen or alcohol.\n",
      "Treatment": "The traditional treatment for hemochromatosis is periodic removal of blood (phlebotomy), as is done during blood donation. Blood may be removed as often as once a week until iron levels fall to normal. After that, phlebotomy usually needs to be done about every two to four months to keep iron levels in the blood at an acceptable level. Your blood count will be monitored to make sure that too much blood is not being removed, which can lead to anemia. You may be given recommendations to modify your diet. You also may need treatment for specific disorders, such as diabetes.\nAnother approach to treatment is called chelation therapy, in which people are given medication that binds to iron, removing it from the body and lowering the amount of stored iron. However, phlebotomy is so effective and simple that chelation therapy is rarely necessary.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have a family history of hemochromatosis or are starting to experience any symptoms of the disease.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With early diagnosis and treatment, the serious consequences of iron overload in the body can often be avoided. However, once tissue damage has developed, problems related to that damage, such as arthritis or diabetes, are usually long lasting. A liver transplant is sometimes necessary for people with advanced liver failure, and people with hemochromatosis and cirrhosis of the liver are more likely to develop a form of liver cancer called hepatoma. Screening tests, including ultrasound and blood tests, may detect hepatoma at a curable stage.\n",

      "What is hemophilia?": "Hemophilia is an inherited disorder. It prevents blood from clotting properly. People with hemophilia bleed longer than usual. This bleeding can range from mild to severe. In severe cases, people with hemophilia can bleed to death.\nBecause of how they are inherited, the most severe and common types of hemophilia affect men far more often than women.\nClotting is the process in which the blood thickens or congeals. This prevents a cut or other injury from bleeding endlessly. Clotting factors are substances in the blood that help the blood to clot. People with hemophilia do not have enough clotting factors.\nBlood clotting involves two systems:\nThe main clotting factors involved in hemophilia are Factor VIII, Factor IX, and Factor XI.\nThere are several types of hemophilia:\nThe severity of disease varies depending on how low the affected factor level is. Hemophilia A and B can be mild, moderate, or severe while Hemophilia C is rarely severe.\n",
      "Symptoms of hemophilia": "People with hemophilia may bleed anywhere in the body. However, they seldom bleed significantly from small cuts or puncture wounds (such as having a blood test).\nRather, hemophiliacs bleed more than other people do from significant injuries, trauma, or surgery. How badly and how often people bleed directly relates to how much clotting factor they have.\nPeople with hemophilia may experience:\nA less common but more serious complication is bleeding into the brain. Symptoms include sudden nausea, headache, and decreased mental awareness.\nSymptoms of factor XI deficiency usually appear only in people who inherit the disease from both parents. Symptoms can include:\nIn hemophilia C, bleeding without any cause is rare.\n",
      "Diagnosing hemophilia": "People with severe hemophilia often develop bleeding problems within the first two years of life. Many infants are diagnosed when they have bleeding during delivery or prolonged bleeding after circumcision. Others are diagnosed in childhood. They may develop excessive bruising and bleeding into joints after typical childhood injuries.\nPeople with mild hemophilia may not be diagnosed for decades. The diagnosis may be made only after they experience abnormal bleeding after trauma, injury, or surgery.\nIf your doctor suspects that you have hemophilia, he or she will ask how often you bleed and how severely. Your doctor will also ask if anyone in your family has a bleeding problem.\nYour doctor will examine you. He or she will focus on evidence of past bleeding into the skin, muscles and joints.\nA variety of blood tests will show if your blood has a clotting defect. The diagnosis of hemophilia A or B or factor XI deficiency can be confirmed by measuring the amount-specific clotting factors and genetic testing.\n",
      "Expected duration of hemophilia": "Hemophilia is a lifelong illness. Symptoms usually can be controlled with proper medical treatment.\n",
      "Preventing hemophilia": "People with a family history of hemophilia can learn their risks of passing hemophilia to their children. A simple blood test is usually all that is necessary.\nPeople with hemophilia should take steps to avoid injuries, accidents, and excessive strain on the joints. This can help to prevent episodes of bleeding. For example:\nPeople with hemophilia may need blood transfusions during or after an episode of bleeding. They should be immunized against hepatitis A and B, diseases that can be carried in blood products.\nPeople with hemophilia should avoid aspirin and other medications that affect blood clotting.\n",
      "Treating hemophilia": "",
      "Preventive treatment": "Clotting factor concentrates help to replace the missing clotting factor in the blood. This can help to decrease how often and how severely you bleed. Clotting factor concentrates are given by injection into a vein, and may be recommended to prevent bleeding (either regularly or prior to high-risk events such as planned surgery).\nSome hemophilia factors are genetically engineered while others are prepared from carefully screened blood donors.\nBecause these clotting factors are large proteins (large complex chemical structures), patients may develop inhibitors or antibodies that neutralize the ability of these factors to be effective. Additional medicines may be required if an inhibitor develops after getting these clotting factors.\nIn addition to therapies that replace deficient clotting factors, a number of newer treatments are available for prevention of bleeding in Hemophilia A and/or B, including:\n",
      "Treatment for excessive bleeding": "Sometimes excessive bleeding occurs despite preventive treatments and the use of replacement clotting factors. Hospital treatment is necessary when bleeding occurs. The situation is an emergency when it involves the brain, neck, the central nervous system, or a vital organ.\nPeople with hemophilia may require blood transfusions to treat excessive blood loss.\nAll surgical or invasive procedures should be done in a hospital to properly handle bleeding. Consult your doctor before having dental work.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you notice unexplained or severe bruises or a warm, painful joint on your child's body. If you are an adult and you experience these symptoms, call your doctor.\nA physician trained in disorders of the blood (a hematologist) is best equipped to diagnose and treat hemophilia. People with bleeding disorders should consult with these specialists.\nPeople with hemophilia should wear a medical alert bracelet at all times indicating their condition.\n",
      "Prognosis": "How well you do depends on the type of hemophilia and its severity. Thanks to the development of clotting factor products and other medications that can reduce the risk of excessive bleeding, most people with hemophilia can look forward to a near-normal life span.\nThere are three main complications that may develop in people with hemophilia:\n",

      "What is it?": "A hemorrhagic stroke is bleeding (hemorrhage) that suddenly interferes with the brain's function. This bleeding can occur either within the brain or between the brain and the skull. Hemorrhagic strokes account for about 15% of all strokes, and are divided into categories depending on the site and cause of the bleeding:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a hemorrhagic stroke vary, depending on the cause:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will want to know your medical history and your risk factors for stroke. Your doctor will take your blood pressure and examine you, including a neurological exam and a heart exam.\nTo diagnose and classify your stroke, your doctor will need an imaging test of your brain. Several tests can be useful, including a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. For hemorrhagic strokes, CT scans are the fastest and most effective test. If a subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected, your doctor may do a lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap, in which a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid is removed through a needle inserted into your back. This fluid is examined to see if it contains blood. Another test, called an MRI angiography, can provide information about blood flow to your brain.\nIf these tests show that you are having a hemorrhagic stroke, you will undergo tests to check for the cause. Because a hemorrhagic stroke involves bleeding, it is important to assess the ability of your blood to clot. Blood tests will be done to evaluate your cell counts and the ability of your blood to clot. If you take an anticoagulant drug (andquot;blood thinner\") or antiplatelet medication, your doctor will most likely have stop it and may need to give therapy to reverse the anticlotting effects.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Hemorrhagic stroke is life-threatening. Many of these deaths occur within the first two days. For those who survive a brain hemorrhage, recovery is slow. A minority of people are able to recover complete or near-complete functioning within 30 days of the stroke.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent stroke from intracerebral hemorrhage by controlling your blood pressure. If you take an anticoagulant drug, it's essential to carefully adhere to instructions. If you take warfarin, educate yourself about the effect other drugs and foods can have on the level of the drug in your bloodstream. Too much warfarin in your blood can cause bleeding. You also should be treated for high cholesterol, avoid excessive alcohol use, and never use cocaine or amphetamines. Smoking increases the risk of an aneurysm, so avoiding smoking may prevent some cases of hemorrhagic stroke.\nIt is almost impossible to prevent subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, because these blood vessel abnormalities usually do not cause any symptoms before the hemorrhage occurs.\nScreening tests, such as MRI angiography, may make sense for some asymptomatic people who have two or more close relatives with a history of brain aneurysms or intracerebral hemorrhages to identify arterial malformations before they cause a problem. However, this is impractical as a general guideline because treatment of an aneurysm that is not causing any symptoms involves significant risks, and because most aneurysms never cause serious bleeding.\n",
      "Treatment": "When a large hemorrhage occurs in or around the brain, the entire brain is in danger because of increasing pressure within the skull. Much of the emergency treatment for hemorrhagic stroke involves measuring and lowering pressure. The sugar mannitol, which sometimes is used as a medicine, pulls brain fluid into the bloodstream, can be used to help lower intracranial pressure. The patient may be intubated and connected to a mechanical ventilator to hyperventilate the person as a way to also lower pressure in and around the brain.\nIf necessary, a surgeon will cut the skull bone (with a small drilled hole called a \"burr hole,\" or with a larger surgery) to decrease the compression of the brain tissue. In some cases, surgery is necessary to remove a large portion of the clot after a hemorrhage, but in most patients, the body eventually reabsorbs the clotted blood on its own.\nIn the hours after a hemorrhagic stroke, blood pressure must be closely monitored. Doctors consider the amount of brain swelling present when they decide what blood pressure level is most appropriate.\nIn the case of subarachnoid hemorrhage, which commonly provokes spasms of the arteries nearest to the site of bleeding, medicines may be used to prevent arteries from narrowing when they spasm.\nIf bleeding occurred because of an abnormally formed blood vessel, surgery may be appropriate to prevent a hemorrhage from happening again. An aneurysm can be repaired by placing a surgical clip. Depending upon the size and location of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a neurosurgeon may be able to repair or remove it.\nEarly intervention by an occupational therapist and physical therapist is helpful. These professionals can teach people how to work around a new disability and regain strength after brain injury. Commonly, hospitalization is followed by a period of living in a rehabilitation center, where additional intensive therapy may be provided. The goal of rehabilitation is to help the patient recover as much physical and speaking function as possible.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call for emergency help immediately if you think a friend or family member may be having a stroke. Call your doctor promptly if you develop a severe headache with vomiting. Headaches should also be evaluated by your doctor if they occur frequently or are accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, weakness, or numbness in any part of the body. If you take warfarin, report a new headache to your doctor.\nIf you have a sudden, very severe headache that goes away, it is still important to discuss this with your doctor. Sometimes blood leaks briefly from a blood vessel one or more times before a subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs. The headache this leak causes is called a sentinel headache.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The risk of death and disability depends on the type of hemorrhagic stroke. People with the highest risk of immediate death are those who have a ruptured aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The prognosis is better for those with an intracerebral hemorrhage.\n",

      "What are hemorrhoids?": "Hemorrhoids are lumps or masses of tissue in the anus, which contain enlarged blood vessels. Any increase in abdominal pressure may produce hemorrhoids. This may be from:\nMany patients have no apparent explanation for the formation of hemorrhoids, however.\nInternal hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids lie inside the anal canal, where they primarily cause the symptom of intermittent bleeding, usually with bowel movements, and sometimes mucous discharge. They are usually painless. Internal hemorrhoids also may protrude (prolapse) outside the anus, where they appear as small, grape-like masses. Usually the prolapsed hemorrhoid can be pushed back into the anus with a fingertip.\nExternal hemorrhoids. These lie just outside the anal opening, where they primarily cause symptoms of swelling or bothersome protrusions, and sometimes discomfort. Swelling and discomfort may occur only intermittently. External hemorrhoids may also cause difficulties keeping the anal area clean after bowel movements. External hemorrhoids sometimes develop a blood clot inside of them (\"thrombosis\"), often after a period of diarrhea or constipation. In that case, it produces a sudden firm and painful swelling or lump around the rim of the anus.\nMany patients have both internal and external hemorrhoids.\nHemorrhoids are a very common health problem. Hemorrhoids are more likely to develop in individuals who eat insufficient dietary fiber and don't get enough exercise, which can lead to repeated episodes of constipation and straining to have bowel movements.\n",
      "Symptoms of hemorrhoids": "Symptoms of hemorrhoids include:\nFor thrombosis of an external hemorrhoid, a painful bulge or firm lump suddenly appears at the rim of the anus. The lump may have a blue or purple tint. It may discharge blood.\nSevere pain is not a typical symptom of hemorrhoids (except for thrombosis of an external hemorrhoid).\n",
      "Diagnosing hemorrhoids": "Like most anal or rectal conditions, physicians diagnose hemorrhoids by inspecting the anal area, feeling inside the anus with a gloved finger, and looking inside the anal canal with a small short scope (anoscope). If there is rectal bleeding, it is important that a physician also checks for other more dangerous causes of bleeding, such as colorectal cancer. This evaluation is usually done with a long flexible telescope (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy).\n",
      "Expected duration of hemorrhoids": "Hemorrhoid flare-ups (swelling, irritation and mild discomfort) are usually brief, and most symptoms disappear within a few days.\nIn pregnant women, hemorrhoid symptoms usually improve dramatically or disappear after childbirth.\nIntermittent slight bleeding from hemorrhoids may carry on for months or years.\nPainful swelling from thrombosis of an external hemorrhoid usually resolves over a period of days to weeks.\n",
      "Preventing hemorrhoids": "You can often prevent hemorrhoids by preventing constipation. Some of the following diet and lifestyle changes may help you to soften your stool, establish a regular schedule for bowel movements, and avoid the straining that can lead to hemorrhoids:\n",
      "Treating hemorrhoids": "If you are experiencing a flare-up of hemorrhoid swelling and discomfort, try the following:\nIf you have persistent or severe hemorrhoid symptoms your doctor may offer one of the following treatment options:\n",

      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have bleeding from your rectum, especially true if you are over age 40, when there is an increase in the risk of rectal bleeding from colorectal cancer or other serious digestive diseases.\nAlso, see your doctor if you have severe rectal pain.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Hemorrhoids are not dangerous, and only need to be treated if they cause very bothersome symptoms. If hemorrhoids occur during pregnancy, they will usually regress spontaneously after childbirth. For hemorrhoids related to constipation, the prognosis is also good, provided you make the necessary changes to your diet and lifestyle. For hemorrhoids that cause persistent symptoms despite nonsurgical treatment, the results from office treatment or surgery are usually very good.\n",

      "What is hepatitis A?": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection that can inflame and temporarily damage the liver. Unlike other forms of hepatitis, hepatitis A rarely causes severe illness and does not lead to a persistent infection. Spread of the virus most often occurs from ingestion of contaminated food or water. It also can be passed during sexual practices that involve the anus. In rare cases, hepatitis A can be spread by contact with the blood of a person who has the infection, for instance, when intravenous drug users share needles.\nMany people have been exposed to hepatitis A. Symptoms can be very mild. So, you may not even be aware that you had the infection.\nAmericans most likely to get hepatitis A include:\n",
      "Symptoms of hepatitis A": "If the infection is mild, there may not be any symptoms, especially in a child. When symptoms appear, they can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing hepatitis A": "Your doctor may ask whether you have eaten shellfish recently or traveled to a foreign country with poor sanitation. He or she will ask about your personal hygiene habits and whether you have been near someone who has hepatitis A.\nYour doctor will examine you to check for swelling and tenderness near your liver and for a yellowish color to your skin and the whites of your eyes. You will need to have blood tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration of hepatitis A": "Hepatitis A usually lasts two to eight weeks, although some people can be ill for as long as six months. The infection is likely to last longer and be more severe in people who are older or are in poor health.\n",
      "Preventing hepatitis A": "You can reduce your risk of getting hepatitis A by following these basic guidelines:\nA vaccine to prevent hepatitis A is available for all adults and older children. It should be routinely given to:\nChildren who are not vaccinated by 2 years of age can be vaccinated at later visits. For travelers, the vaccine series should be started at least one month before traveling to provide the best protection.\nIf you have been exposed to someone with hepatitis A, your doctor may give you the hepatitis vaccine or an injection of hepatitis A immune globulin to help prevent you from getting symptoms of the illness. Sometimes both are given. You should contact your doctor as soon as you become aware of the exposure. After two weeks post exposure, the immune globulin shot is not effective.\n",
      "Treating hepatitis A": "There are no drugs to treat hepatitis A. Doctors generally recommend getting bed rest, eating well-balanced meals, drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding alcoholic beverages. It is also essential to avoid medications that can be toxic to your liver, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you suspect that you have been exposed to someone with hepatitis A or if you are showing symptoms of the illness. If you are planning to travel to a foreign country, ask your doctor whether you should be vaccinated against hepatitis A before your trip.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Nearly everyone who gets hepatitis A will recover completely within a few weeks to months. A very small number of people can get severe disease. In very rare cases (less than one-tenth of 1% of patients), the disease can cause liver failure, which can result in death if a liver transplant cannot be arranged.\nIn people who already had liver disease or other types of hepatitis, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C, the risk of severe disease from hepatitis A is much higher.\n",

      "What is hepatitis B?": "Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis B is hepatitis caused by the hepatitis B virus.\nHepatitis B virus spreads through contact with infected blood. Specifically, hepatitis B may be spread through:\nThe hepatitis B virus can cause temporary or long-term (chronic) hepatitis. The initial infection with the virus may not even cause symptoms. Immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine can greatly reduce the risk of hepatitis B.\nPeople that do develop symptoms following initial infection with the virus have acute hepatitis. Most of them will clear the virus from their liver and blood.\nBut a minority of people will develop a long-term infection. This is called chronic hepatitis. In chronic hepatitis, the symptoms of hepatitis often disappear then come back later. People with chronic hepatitis remain infectious. They can pass on the virus to others.\nSome people are not able to rid their body of the infection, but they do not have any symptoms of disease. These people are called carriers. They also can pass the infection to others.\n",
      "Symptoms of hepatitis B": "The initial symptoms of acute hepatitis B vary. They can include:\nThese symptoms may be followed by jaundice. Jaundice is a yellowing of the eyes and skin, and a darkening of the urine.\nMost people recover from acute hepatitis. They are no longer infected with the virus when their illness ends. However, about one in 10 adults may develop chronic hepatitis. They remain infected by the virus, can develop chronic liver disease, and can pass the virus to other people.\nPeople with chronic hepatitis may be free of symptoms for long periods. But symptoms eventually reappear. Symptoms, when they do occur, may include:\nA small number of people with chronic hepatitis develop liver cirrhosis. This is scarring of the liver that results in poor liver function. They may develop symptoms of advanced liver disease, including:\nPeople with hepatitis B who develop cirrhosis are at risk of developing liver cancer.\n",
      "Diagnosing hepatitis B": "Your doctor will ask about any potential exposures to hepatitis B. This includes any illegal drug use or unprotected sexual activity. Your doctor will examine your skin, eyes, and abdomen for evidence of fluid accumulation. He or she will estimate the size of your liver.\nYour doctor will order blood tests. These check your liver function, and can spot liver damage.\nBlood tests can also confirm a hepatitis B diagnosis. They detect the presence and amount of hepatitis B virus in the blood. The tests also detect antibodies to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by your immune system to attack the virus.\nPeople who have completely recovered from an acute hepatitis B infection usually have antibodies in their blood, but they do not have any detectable virus. People with acute or chronic hepatitis who have an active infection usually have detectable levels of virus in their blood.\nYour doctor may suspect that you have significant liver damage. In this case, he or she may recommend a liver biopsy. In a biopsy, a small amount of tissue is removed and examined in a laboratory. It helps determine whether you are developing signs of cirrhosis.\n",
      "Expected duration of hepatitis B": "Most people recover from an acute infection within three months. People may feel well during this time. But it may take up to four months before hepatitis B virus is no longer detected in the blood.\nChronic hepatitis B can be treated with a variety of medications. However, it rarely is cured.\n",
      "Preventing hepatitis B": "You can prevent hepatitis B infection by avoiding exposure to the virus:\nIn the United States and many other countries, hepatitis B vaccine is offered to all children. Adults at high risk of exposure also should be immunized. These include medical personnel.\n",
      "Treating hepatitis B": "There is no cure for acute hepatitis B. Rather, treatment is aimed at reducing the amount of virus in the body, and easing the inflammation that causes the symptoms.\nIn rare cases, an episode of acute hepatitis B can be unusually severe. It may require hospitalization. A very small number of people with acute infection will develop liver failure. They require a liver transplant to prevent death.\nDoctors treat chronic hepatitis B with antiviral medications when there is evidence of persistent virus activity accompanied by ongoing inflammation and/or scarring of the liver. Examples of antiviral drugs approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B includeadefovir,entecavir,lamivudine,telbivudine, andtenofovir.\nPeople with chronic liver disease that continues to worsen can be considered for a liver transplant. This procedure can be lifesaving.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you develop symptoms of hepatitis B. Severe symptoms may require hospital treatment.\nIf you have a chronic hepatitis B infection and you develop symptoms of advanced liver disease, seek immediate medical attention. Symptoms of advanced liver disease include:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Severe acute hepatitis B can occur in a small number of cases, and can sometimes be fatal.\nIn most cases of acute hepatitis B, people recover completely after the short-term infection. However, a small percentage of patients go on to develop chronic hepatitis B.\nIn people with chronic hepatitis B, the outlook depends upon the severity of liver inflammation, the amount of scarring (cirrhosis), and response to antiviral treatment. People with mild liver damage who have no virus detected in the blood have a better prognosis.\n",

      "What is hepatitis C?": "Hepatitis C is a viral infection. It can inflame and damage the liver.\nHepatitis C is usually transmitted through contact with infected blood. It can be spread through:\nThe hepatitis C virus can cause short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) hepatitis C. Most people with acute hepatitis C eventually develop chronic hepatitis C.\nMost people with hepatitis C don't know that they are infected. That's because hepatitis C usually does not cause symptoms.\nAfter having this silent infection for 20 to 30 years, about one-third of people develop cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is a serious liver disease that can lead to death. A smaller group of people with chronic hepatitis C develop liver cancer.\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in people at higher than average risk. Also there is a high prevalence of infection in adults born between 1945 and 1965. If you were born during that time, you should get a one-time simple blood test to make sure you are not infected.\n",
      "Symptoms of hepatitis C": "Many people with hepatitis C do not have any symptoms.\nSome people develop symptoms that last for up to three months. These symptoms include:\nSome people with acute hepatitis C completely eliminate the virus from their bodies. They don't suffer any long-term consequences.\nBut the majority of people with acute hepatitis C remain infected. They develop chronic hepatitis C.\nOnly some people with long-term hepatitis C develop symptoms. These symptoms include:\nMost people with chronic hepatitis C do not have any symptoms for 20 to 30 years. All the while, however, the virus slowly damages their livers. Unless they are tested for hepatitis C, many of these people do not know that they are infected. That is, until they develop the symptoms of advanced liver disease.\n",
      "Diagnosing hepatitis C": "To make a diagnosis, your doctor will ask about symptoms of hepatitis C or advanced liver disease.\nHe or she will ask about your exposure to risk factors for hepatitis C. These include:\nYour doctor will examine you. He or she will look for evidence of liver disease, such as:\nHepatitis C infection is confirmed by certain tests. One test looks for hepatitis C virus in your blood. Another test detects infection-fighting proteins (antibodies). Antibodies to hepatitis C indicate that you have been exposed to the virus.\nIf you have hepatitis C, blood tests can determine the subtype of virus. Different subtypes respond differently to treatment.\nYou may need a liver biopsy. In a biopsy, a small piece of liver tissue is removed and examined in a laboratory. The biopsy helps predict whether you will develop complications from liver disease.\n",
      "Expected duration of hepatitis C": "Most people with hepatitis C have the infection for life. Some eventually develop cirrhosis or other forms of severe liver disease.\n",
      "Preventing hepatitis C": "There is no vaccine to protect against hepatitis C. The only way to prevent this disease is to avoid the risk factors.\nThe most effective ways to prevent hepatitis C:\nIt is rare for someone in a monogamous, long-term relationship with an infected partner to become infected. Discuss your need for precautions with your doctor.\nDrinking alcohol makes hepatitis C worse. If you have hepatitis C, avoid alcohol.\n",
      "Treating hepatitis C": "Not everyone infected with hepatitis C needs treatment. Discuss the potential benefits and side effects of treatment with your doctor.\nThe first treatment used for hepatitis C was a combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin (Virazole). Side effects from these drugs are very common. And many people don't tolerate the therapy, especially the interferon.\nTreatment today has changed dramatically. Antiviral drugs are much more effective at clearing the hepatitis C virus from the body and allowing the liver to heal. They also have fewer and less severe side effects compared to interferon.\nThe treatment goal is to totally clear your blood of any detectable virus using a blood test called HCV RNA. If you have no detectable HCV RNA 12 weeks or more after you have completed antiviral therapy, the cure rate is close to 100%.\nYour doctor will recommend hepatitis A and B vaccinations. He or she will also advise against drinking any alcohol. These actions will reduce the chance that you will have further liver damage.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have symptoms of hepatitis C. Also call if you may have been exposed to the virus.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone ages 18 to 79 have one-time screening for hepatitis C.\nHigh-risk individuals often need periodic testing for hepatitis C. High-risk individuals include anyone who:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people infected with hepatitis C virus eventually develop chronic hepatitis C.\nLong-term complications often do not develop until after decades of infection. At that time, some people develop cirrhosis. A smaller group of people develop liver cancer.\nAnti-viral therapy can cure the condition and substantially decrease the risk of long-term complications.\n",

      "What is hereditary-patterned baldness?": "Hereditary-pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss. Hereditary-pattern baldness is not really a disease, but a natural condition caused by some combination of genetics, hormone levels and the aging process.\nAlmost all men and women will notice hair loss or hair thinning as they age. However, up to 40% of men and women will experience a more obvious form of this condition. Hair loss typically begins in the 20s and 30s, although in women the changes are most noticeable after menopause. The condition is also called androgenetic alopecia and, in men, male-pattern baldness.\nResearchers have begun to understand more about the cause of this type of hair loss. Under the influence of a form of the male hormone testosterone, the normal cycle of hair growth changes, resulting in shorter, thinner or \"miniaturized\" hair. Eventually, hair growth in certain parts of the scalp stops entirely, which causes the typical pattern of hair loss. Contrary to the folk wisdom that baldness is inherited from one's mother's family, the condition seems to depend on genes contributed by both parents.\n",
      "Symptoms of hereditary-patterned baldness": "Hereditary-pattern baldness starts with thinning of the hair and often progresses to complete hair loss on parts of the scalp. Hairs on the pillow, in the tub or on the comb are unreliable symptoms of hair loss. The average non-balding person loses 100 hairs per day, and more hair may fall out under certain circumstances, such as after childbirth or a serious illness.\nIn men, hair loss typically begins at the temples and crown and proceeds in an M-shaped pattern. In the most advanced stage, only a rim of hair along the side and back of the scalp remains.\n\nIn women, hair loss tends to be more widespread but better hidden. The top of the head down the middle is most commonly affected, often in a \"Christmas tree\" pattern. In contrast to men, the hairline along the forehead and temples usually remains normal in women. Complete loss of hair in any one place on the scalp is unusual and may suggest that a different problem is the cause, such as alopecia areata (an immune system disorder that causes bald patches), a fungus infection or one of a number of other skin conditions.\n",
      "Diagnosing hereditary-patterned baldness": "Hereditary-pattern baldness usually is diagnosed by both its pattern and a history of a similar type of hair loss affecting family members. In most people, no further tests are required.\n",
      "Expected duration of hereditary-patterned baldness": "Hair loss is permanent.\n",
      "Preventing hereditary-patterned baldness": "If you begin to lose hair in a hereditary pattern, you may be able to slow further hair loss by using minoxidil (Rogaine) or finasteride (Propecia). Minoxidil can be used by both men and women, while finasteride usually is used just for men.\nMinoxidil is a solution, now available over the counter. It is applied to the scalp twice daily. It can help to slow further hair loss in some people, and within four to eight months there may be some hair regrowth. In men a higher strength (5%) works best. In women there seems to be little difference in effect of the 2% strength and the 5% strength, and there is the risk of development of facial hair with the 5% strength. One caution: If you stop using minoxidil, you probably will lose any hair that may have been retained or restored by the medication.\nFinasteride is a prescription-only pill that blocks the formation of the type of testosterone that affects hair growth. Higher strengths of the same medication are used in men to stop non-cancerous (benign) growth of the prostate gland. Studies suggest that finasteride helps to prevent hair loss in up to 99% of men with hereditary-patterned baldness, and that two-thirds experience some new hair growth. As with minoxidil, any benefits from the medication are quickly lost once it is discontinued. In addition, a small number of men develop difficulty with sexual function.\nFinasteride does not appear to prevent hair loss in women. It also may cause birth defects, and should not be used by any woman who could possibly get pregnant. However, other types of hormonal treatment, such as certain types of birth control pills, may help the small number of women with hair loss that have elevated levels of male hormones.\nIn some people, hair loss may be caused by certain hair treatments (straightening, coloring), hairstyles (tight braids) or hair pulling. These do not cause hereditary-pattern baldness, but they may contribute to hair loss and should be discontinued.\nA variety of other creams, oils, lotions and herbal remedies for hair loss are regularly advertised. However, only minoxidil and finasteride have been proven useful.\nSome over-the-counter scalp treatments can cause irritation or harm and worsen hair loss.\n",
      "Treating hereditary-patterned baldness": "Minoxidil and finasteride may prevent hair loss and promote new hair growth. This effect, however, is quite unpredictable from one person to the next.\nHair weaves, wigs and toupees can be used. In addition, a variety of surgical techniques also can be used, including:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call a health care professional if you have any of the following symptoms; they can suggest a problem other than hereditary-pattern baldness:\nMost doctors or dermatologists will prescribe finasteride to men who would like to use it. If you are interested in cosmetic surgery, consult a cosmetic surgeon or dermatologist who specializes in hair restoration.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Unless a preventive treatment is started, hereditary hair loss becomes more pronounced over time. Generally, the earlier hair loss begins, the more severe it will become. Minoxidil or finasteride, if used, must be continued indefinitely to maintain results.\n",

      "What is it?": "A hernia occurs when part of an internal organ or body part protrudes through an opening into another area where it ordinarily should not be located. There are many different types of hernias, but the most common is when a portion of the intestine protrudes through a weak area in the muscular wall of the abdomen. This causes an abnormal bulge under the skin of the abdomen, usually near the groin or the navel.\nHernias occur in various locations. Some hernias are present at birth, while others develop during adulthood. Hernias may enlarge due to increased pressure inside the abdomen, such as during straining, persistent coughing, obesity, or pregnancy.\n\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most hernias cause a bulge under the skin (except hiatus hernias). The location of this bulge depends on the specific type of hernia. For example, an inguinal hernia appears as a bulge in the groin, while an umbilical hernia appears as a bulge near the navel. Some hernias can cause twinges of pain or a pulling sensation, but most do not cause pain. Hernias are usually easier to see with coughing or straining. They also tend to be more prominent with standing and often disappear with lying down.\nA hernia is considered incarcerated if a portion of intestine becomes trapped in the hernia and is unable to slide back into the abdomen. Rarely, the trapped intestine can strangulate. This means that the contained intestine dies because its blood supply has been cut off by the constriction of the hernia. This causes severe pain and requires urgent surgery.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Most people discover their own hernias by noticing a bulge. Sometimes, however, your doctor will find a small hernia as part of a routine examination. Your doctor makes the diagnosis by physical examination. He or she may ask you to strain or cough (especially while standing), which may make the bulge easier to see or feel.\nRarely, you may have symptoms that suggest a hernia, but the doctor will be unable to find one at the time of examination. In these circumstances, your doctor may recommend a computed tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound of the abdomen.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Most hernias stay the same or slowly get larger over time. Umbilical hernias, however, are a special situation. Most small umbilical hernias that appear before a baby is 6 months old will disappear before the child's first birthday. Even larger umbilical hernias may disappear before age 3 or 4.\n",
      "Prevention": "Losing weight is helpful if you are overweight. If you frequently need to strain when you move your bowels, speak to your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe stool-softening medication or suggest that you modify your diet to include more high-fiber foods.\n",
      "Treatment": "Although not all hernias need to be operated on, hernias that cause symptoms or that become larger should be repaired by a surgeon. The technique used to repair your hernia depends on its type, size, and location. The surgical options include:\nIf you are considering having a hernia repaired, you and your surgeon will discuss which technique is most appropriate for you.\nHernias that become incarcerated or strangulated require immediate medical attention. Your doctor will try to massage the hernia back through the hole in which it is stuck. If this cannot be done, emergency surgery may be needed. Otherwise, most hernia repairs can be done on an outpatient basis as a non-emergency.\nUmbilical hernias in infants usually are not treated surgically unless the hernia continues past the child's third or fourth birthday, becomes larger, causes symptoms, or strangulates. Umbilical hernias are more likely to need surgery if the opening through which the hernia passes is greater than 2 centimeters in diameter.\nHiatus hernias that are not causing symptoms of acid reflux do not need to be treated. When symptoms occur, medicine may be prescribed to decrease acid reflux. Surgery may be recommended for large hiatus hernias that cause continuing symptoms or for hernias that become stuck inside the chest.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor right away if there is significant pain at the site of a hernia. This can be the first sign that a hernia is incarcerated or strangulated. See your doctor if you notice a new, painless lump or swelling in a location where hernias typically occur.\n",
      "Prognosis": "When surgery is used to repair hernias, the outlook is generally very good.\n",

      "What is it?": "A hernia repair is the surgical procedure to fix a hernia. This procedure is also known as herniorrhaphy.\nA hernia occurs when part of an internal organ or body part protrudes into an area where it should not. The most common hernias occur in the abdominal area. A small portion of the intestine, or a piece of fat, pokes through a weak area in the muscular wall of the abdomen. This causes an abnormal bulge under the skin of the abdomen, usually near the groin or navel.\nFor most situations, there are two kinds of hernia repair:\nFor most people, a hernia repair does not require overnight hospitalization.\n",
      "When is it necessary?": "There are many different types of hernias. The most common occurs when a portion of the intestine or a bit of fat pokes through a weak area in the muscular abdominal wall. This causes an abnormal bulge under the skin. This bulge is usually near the groin or the navel.\nMen are much more likely than women to develop groin hernias. Men have a small hole in the abdominal wall in the groin. This is where the cord to the testicle passes through. If this hole enlarges abnormally, it can lead to a hernia.\nHernias can cause pain or pressure. Or, they can appear as a painless lump.\nMost hernias become larger over time and will not permanently resolve on their own. There is a small risk that part of the bowel could get trapped within the hernia. This can lead to a medical emergency. However, not all hernias need to be repaired.\nYou may choose to have surgery if:\n",
      "Preparation": "Most hernias are diagnosed during an office visit with your doctor. Surgery is planned for a later time, at your convenience.\nYour doctor will review your medical history and examine you. If there is any chance you might be pregnant, inform your doctor before surgery. Your doctor may order certain tests to make sure that you can undergo surgery safely. These tests may include blood tests or an electrocardiogram (EKG).\nAbout one week before your hernia repair, your doctor may ask you to stop taking aspirin and other medications that could increase the risk of bleeding. You will be asked not to eat or drink anything beginning the night before surgery (except medicines). This will reduce the risk of vomiting during surgery.\nOn the day of your surgery, you should wear loose-fitting clothing. Ask your doctor if you should take your regular medications with a sip of water. You also should arrange for someone to drive you home after the surgery.\n",
      "How it's done": "Hernia repair can be done under different kinds of anesthesia. If you receive general anesthesia, you will be unconscious during the procedure. If you are given spinal, regional, or local anesthesia, you will remain awake. But the pain will be blocked in the area of surgery.\nAn intravenous line will be inserted into one of your veins to deliver fluids and medications. The procedure generally takes less than one or two hours to complete.\nTraditional hernia repair— In a traditional repair, the surgeon makes an incision several inches long near the hernia. Once the surgeon can clearly see the herniated body part, he or she gently pushes it back into its proper place. Then the weakness or hole in the abdominal wall is repaired with stitches. Finally, the outer skin incision is closed with stitches.\nSurgeons frequently use a synthetic mesh patch to repair hernias. These patches may reduce the tension on the repair. They may also reduce pain and make it less likely that your hernia will return. However, mesh patches may slightly increase the possibility of scarring or infection.\nLaparoscopic hernia repair— In a laparoscopic repair, a harmless gas is injected into your abdomen to inflate it. This gives your surgeon more room to work and a better view.\nNext, the laparoscope is inserted through a small incision at your navel. Other surgical instruments are inserted in several other small incisions in the abdomen. These may include tools for cutting and stapling. A camera on the laparoscope transmits images from your abdomen to a viewing screen. These images guide the surgeon in using the surgical instruments.\nThe surgeon gently pulls the herniated body part back into its proper place. He or she then positions a mesh patch over the weakness in your abdominal wall. The patch is secured in place with harmless staples, surgical clips, or stitches. At the end of the procedure, your abdomen is deflated. The small incisions are closed with sutures or surgical tape.\nTraditional hernia repair can be done with the patient under local anesthesia. But laparoscopic repair requires general anesthesia. Traditional repairs of groin hernias have a longer track record of success. However, laparoscopic surgery causes less pain and often allows people to return to their usual activities more quickly.\nAfter surgery, you will be monitored closely and given pain medication. Most people recover within a few hours and can go home the same day.\n",
      "Follow-up": "Most people can return to desk work, driving, and other light activities within a few days of surgery. If you work at a more physical job, you may need to wait for two weeks or more.\nYou will visit your doctor for follow-up some weeks after surgery. Your doctor will remove any stitches and check the healing of your incisions.\nAsk your doctor about when you can resume specific activities such as sports, heavy labor, and lifting.\n",
      "Risks": "Hernia repair is generally very safe surgery. Nevertheless, there is always a small risk of complications. These include\nIn children, hernia repair has long-term success in nearly all cases. In adults, the hernia returns in a small percentage of people. The rate can be higher in some special situations.\n",

      "What is it?": "The discs in your spine, called intervertebral discs, are thin, oblong structures that serve as cushions between the bones of your back (vertebrae). Each disc is made of a soft gel core surrounded by a tough, fibrous outer shell. This structure allows the disc to be firm enough to maintain the space between the vertebrae, but soft enough to compress when the spine flexes during bending, leaning and turning sideways.\nIn some people, mostly middle-aged adults, a disc's tough outer shell develops an area of weakness or a small tear. When this happens, part of the disc's soft inner core can bulge out of its normal position (herniate), producing a condition called a herniated disc.\nIf the herniated disc presses on nerves in the nearby spinal canal, this can cause variety of nerve-related symptoms, including pain, numbness, and muscle weakness. In the most severe cases, a herniated disc can compress nerves that control the bowel and bladder, causing urinary incontinence and loss of bowel control.\n\nScientists do not fully understand why discs herniate. Most theories attribute this condition to a combination of the following factors:\nThere are three distinct areas of the vertebral column where a herniated disc may occur:\nHerniated discs are most common in the lumbar and cervical regions. Herniated discs are relatively rare in the thoracic region, where they account for only 1 in every 200 to 400 disk herniations.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The first symptom of a herniated disc is usually back pain in the area of the affected disc. Some researchers believe this pain is a signal that a disc's tough outer shell has been injured or weakened, not necessarily that the inner core has herniated. If the inner core does herniate and press on a nearby nerve, the resulting symptoms vary depending on the location of the herniated disc:\nIn most people with a lumbar disc herniation, severe leg pain is the chief complaint. This pain is called sciatica because it comes from pressure on the sciatic nerve. It usually begins in the lower back, then spreads into the buttocks and down the back of one thigh and leg. Sciatica typically becomes worse if the patient coughs, sneezes, bears down, or moves the back abruptly. While often relieved by rest, sciatica may become worse with driving or lifting. In addition, there may be numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness in the buttocks or leg on the side of the pain.\nIn rarer and more severe forms of lumbar disc herniation, the nerve is compressed more extensively. If this happens, additional symptoms can develop, including rectal pain; loss of bowel and bladder control; and numbness around the genital area, buttocks, or backs of the thighs.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your health care professional will review your medical history, including any history of fever, cancer, steroid use, or recent back injuries. Your doctor then will ask you specific questions about your pain:\nAfter reviewing your medical history and symptoms, your doctor will do a thorough physical examination to rule out other illnesses that can cause back pain, such as muscle spasm or arthritis, or a more serious (and rarer) cause such as cancer or a bone infection of the vertebrae.\nThis general physical exam will be followed by a more detailed examination of your back, during which your doctor will look for differences between your right and left sides, muscle spasms, abnormal curvature, limitation of movement, lack of flexibility, areas of numbness, and areas of tenderness. Your doctor's findings will help to rule out other types of back problems that can cause similar symptoms.\nIf you have symptoms of lumbar disc herniation, your doctor may ask you to do specific maneuvers, such as walking on your toes, walking on your heels, squatting and standing, and flexing your ankle against resistance. Your doctor will want to do a straight leg-raising test. You will lie on your back with your legs straight. While you relax, your doctor slowly raises each leg individually to determine the angle where your leg pain begins. Your doctor will do a neurological examination, looking for changes in your reflexes, as well as for any evidence of muscle weakness or decreased sensation.\nSpinal x-rays, a computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be recommended if your initial diagnosis is not clear, if your symptoms persist or worsen after several weeks of treatment, or if you are considering surgery. Because imaging tests, such as MRI or a CT scan, may show disc abnormalities even in people without symptoms, the results must be interpreted carefully. It is common to find abnormalities that are unrelated to your symptoms. Your doctor also may recommend an electromyography, a test that analyzes muscle and nerve function, to identify sites of nerve compression or irritation.\n",
      "Expected duration": "In most people, back pain gradually improves within four to six weeks of treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "In many cases, it is not possible to prevent a herniated disc. However, if you have suffered from a herniated disc in the past, you may be able to decrease your chances of it happening again by:\n",
      "Treatment": "In most cases, a herniated disc (with or without sciatica) will respond to conservative treatment. This may include limited bed rest (generally no more than a day or two); warm baths; heating pads; and medications, such as aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or muscle relaxants. Some doctors prescribe oral corticosteroids, although the benefits of this treatment are uncertain.\nBecause prolonged inactivity can promote deconditioning, your doctor may suggest that you start an exercise regimen early. Even if you begin your treatment with one to two days of bed rest, you may still be asked to complete two or three 20-minute periods of walking each day. After one to two weeks, you usually can begin a more strenuous program of daily aerobic exercises (walking, biking, swimming) and physical therapy. Other types of conservative treatment that have been helpful to some people include ultrasound, massage, and acupuncture.\nWhen these more conservative measures don't work, epidural steroid injections may be helpful. This involves the careful injection of a long-acting steroid and an anesthetic into the space near the spinal cord and compressed nerves. These injections are guided by x-rays or CT scanning so that the needle can be placed precisely in the proper location.\nIf you have lost bowel or bladder control, if you have evidence of progressive nerve damage, or if you have unrelenting pain that persists despite weeks of conservative treatment, more aggressive treatment may be needed, including surgery. In most cases, this means removing the disc (diskectomy), which may require major surgery. Increasingly, though, a less invasive operation is done in which the herniated disc is removed through a hollow tube inserted through a tiny incision.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your health care professional immediately if you develop severe back pain, especially if you also have pain or numbness in your arms or legs or if you lose control of your bowels or bladder.\n",
      "Prognosis": "About 60% of people respond to conservative therapy within one week, and 90% to 98% respond within six weeks. Surgical intervention has a high success rate when MRI or CT shows that the cause of the symptoms can be corrected.\n",

      "What is a hiatal hernia?": "A hernia occurs when part of an internal organ or body part protrudes through an opening into an area where it shouldn't. A hiatal hernia is named for the hiatus, an opening in the diaphragm between your chest and your stomach. Normally, the esophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach) goes through this opening. In a hiatal hernia, part of the stomach and/or the section where the stomach joins the esophagus (called the gastroesophageal junction) slips through the hiatus into the chest.\nThere are two types of hiatal hernias:\n",
      "Symptoms of hiatal hernia": "Sliding hiatal hernias may not cause any symptoms, or they may cause heartburn that is worse when you lean forward, strain or lie down. There may be chronic belching and, sometimes, regurgitation (backflow of stomach contents into the throat).\nIn some cases, a paraesophageal hernia may slide into the chest and become trapped (incarcerated) and unable to slide back into the abdomen. If this happens, there is a danger that the trapped hernia may die because its blood supply is cut off (strangulated). Symptoms of a strangulated hiatal hernia include sudden severe chest pain and difficulty swallowing. This situation requires immediate medical treatment.\nOccasionally a hiatal hernia can cause anemia from bleeding. This can occur if the wall of the stomach becomes raw from rubbing against the edges of the diaphragm hiatus.\n",
      "Diagnosing hiatal hernia": "Your doctor will ask about any history of heartburn or chest discomfort, especially if it seems to be related to eating a heavy meal, bending forward, or lifting heavy objects.\nYour doctor may suspect that you have a hiatal hernia based on your symptoms and risk factors (age, obesity, smoking, occupation that requires heavy lifting). To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may order one or more of the following tests:\nBecause many people with hiatal hernias are in the same age group that commonly experiences coronary artery disease, and because the symptoms of the two disorders may be very similar, your doctor may order an electrocardiogram (EKG).\n",
      "Expected duration of hiatal hernia": "In some people, a hiatal hernia slowly worsens over time and eventually requires treatment. In other people, however, the condition never causes symptoms, never gets worse and never has a significant impact on health or life.\n",
      "Preventing hiatal hernia": "It is difficult to prevent a hiatal hernia. However, you can reduce your risk by maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking. To prevent a hernia associated with increased abdominal pressure, avoid activities that cause abdominal strain, especially heavy lifting. If you frequently need to strain when you move your bowels, speak to your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe stool-softening medication or suggest that you modify your diet to include more high-fiber foods.\n",
      "Treating hiatal hernia": "Most people with hiatal hernias do not require treatment. When a hiatal hernia is associated with reflux symptoms, such as heartburn, you should eat smaller, more frequent meals; avoid eating for at least two hours before going to bed; and sit up for at least one hour after eating. If lifestyle changes do not relieve the symptoms, your doctor will suggest antacids or acid blockers. Many products are on the market, including both over-the-counter and prescription medications.\nFewer than 5% of people require surgery. You may need surgery to repair the hernia if you have persistent reflux symptoms or inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) that does not heal with medication. Your doctor may advise surgery for a paraesophageal hernia that has a risk of becoming trapped (incarcerated).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have persistent heartburn or difficulty swallowing or feel short of breath after a meal. Call your doctor immediately if you develop heartburn accompanied by nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or an irregular heartbeat. These may be signs of a heart problem rather than of a hiatal hernia or other digestive disorder.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is excellent. Most people with hiatal hernias have few, if any, symptoms. More bothersome symptoms usually are controlled with medications.\n",

      "What is it?": "Blood pressure has two components:\nBlood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). So blood pressure would be expressed, for example, as 120/80 mm Hg.\nHigh blood pressure is diagnosed when one or both of these numbers is too high. High blood pressure is also called hypertension.\nFor decades, high blood pressure was defined as 140/90 mm Hg. In November, 2017, new United States guidelines lowered the threshold for diagnosing the condition. According to new guidelines, anyone with a reading of 130/80 mm Hg or higher has blood pressure. Based on this new definition, nearly half of Americans now fall into this group.\nBlood pressure is now categorized as follows:\nAlthough high blood pressure can cause symptoms such as headache and pounding heartbeat, it often causes no symptoms at all.\nSo why worry about high blood pressure? Because even when high blood pressure is not causing any symptoms, it can silently damage many organs, including the\nYou may not recognize the damage that silent hypertension has been doing to your body until you suddenly are stricken with a major disease. For example, hypertension increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure.\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "Usually, hypertension does not directly cause symptoms. When blood pressure is very high, it can cause headaches, dizziness, fatigue or visual symptoms.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis of hypertension depends on blood pressure readings. Therefore, it's essential that blood pressure be measured carefully.\nTo obtain an accurate blood pressure measurement:\nIf your blood pressure is high, your doctor should examine your eyes, heart, and nervous system, to look for evidence of damage from hypertension.\nIf there is no such evidence, your doctor will likely want to recheck your blood pressure again in a few weeks or have you monitor your blood pressure at home. If your blood pressure is extremely high, your doctor may want to start medication immediately.\nIf you are diagnosed with hypertension, other tests will check for organ damage. These tests can include:\n",
      "Prevention": "To prevent high blood pressure:\nHypertension increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. So it is important to modify your risk factors for coronary artery disease. In addition to the above actions, you should\nYou may be able to cure your hypertension with lifestyle changes alone. Simply changing what you eat and drink can bring down systolic blood pressure by as much as 11 points, according to some estimates.\n",
      "Treatment": "Elevated blood pressure.If your blood pressure is simply elevated, meaning the first number (systolic blood pressure) falls in the range of 120 to 129 while the second number (diastolic blood pressure) remains below 80, medication is not recommended. Instead, you should focus on healthy lifestyle changes:\nStage 1 hypertension.You have stage 1 hypertension if your systolic blood pressure is 130 to 139, your diastolic pressure is 80 to 89, or both. Even if your systolic blood pressure hovers above 130, you still may not need medication immediately. Your doctor may suggest a trial of lifestyle changes first if you don't have heart disease and you have a low risk of developing it over the next 10 years. But many people find that they need to take some type of medication in order to reduce their blood pressure numbers to healthier levels.\nStage 2 hypertension.You have stage 2 hypertension if your systolic pressure is at least 140 mm Hg, your diastolic pressure is at least 90 mm Hg, or both. In addition to lifestyle modifications, you will likely need to start medication to lower your blood pressure. That doesn't mean you will always need drug therapy. Losing weight, decreasing stress, eating healthier, and exercising daily can potentially bring your readings into the normal range. But even if you still need medication, your lifestyle efforts help prevent you from needing higher drug doses in the future.\nExamples of commonly used antihypertensive medications include:\nPeople with diabetes, kidney disease or heart problems are at higher risk of complications from hypertension. As a result, they are usually treated more aggressively with medications.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Adults should have their blood pressure measured at least every few years.\nIf your blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg or higher, schedule regular appointments with your doctor. Have your blood pressure monitored more regularly. And get advice about modifying your lifestyle to prevent future problems.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis for hypertension depends on\nHypertension can lead to a poor prognosis even if you do not have symptoms.\nWhen high blood pressure is treated adequately, the prognosis is much better. Both lifestyle changes and medicines can control your blood pressure.\n",

      "What is it?": "Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body. It performs several vital functions. It is needed to make the walls surrounding the body's cells and is the basic material that is converted to certain hormones. Your body makes all the cholesterol you need. You need only a small amount of fat in your diet to make enough cholesterol to stay healthy.\nThe fat and cholesterol you eat are absorbed in the intestine and transported to the liver. The liver converts fat into cholesterol, and releases cholesterol into the bloodstream. There are two main types of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the \"bad\" cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the \"good\" cholesterol).\nHigh levels of LDL cholesterol are linked to atherosclerosis, which is the accumulation of cholesterol-rich fatty deposits in arteries. This can cause arteries to narrow or become blocked, slowing or stopping the flow of blood to vital organs, especially the heart and brain. Atherosclerosis affecting the heart is called coronary artery disease, and it can cause a heart attack. When atherosclerosis blocks arteries that supply blood to the brain, it can cause a stroke.\nPeople with high levels of HDL cholesterol are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease. However, if a person has both a high HDL and high LDL cholesterol level, he or she might still need treatment to lower the LDL level.\nAccording to guidelines established by the government-sponsored National Cholesterol Education Program, the desirable level for LDL cholesterol depends on whether or not a person already has a disease caused by atherosclerosis or diabetes or other risk factors for coronary artery disease. In addition to a high LDL cholesterol level and diabetes, risk factors for coronary artery disease include:\nThe ideal cholesterol LDL level is less than 70 milligrams per deciliter. If you have coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease or have had a stroke from atherosclerosis, this should be your goal.\nHowever, if you do not have cardiovascular disease and no risk factors for it, an LDL cholesterol level of 100 or even a bit higher may be acceptable.\nYour level of HDL cholesterol also matters. People with levels below 40 milligrams per deciliter are more likely to develop atherosclerosis, heart disease and stroke.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most people with high cholesterol don't have any symptoms until cholesterol-related atherosclerosis causes significant narrowing of the arteries leading to their hearts or brains. The result can be heart-related chest pain (angina) or other symptoms of coronary artery disease, as well as symptoms of decreased blood supply to the brain (transient ischemic attacks or stroke).\nAbout 1 out of every 500 people has an inherited disorder called familial hypercholesterolemia, which can cause extremely high cholesterol levels (above 300 milligrams per deciliter). People with this disorder can develop nodules filled with cholesterol (xanthomas) over various tendons, especially the Achilles tendons of the lower leg. Cholesterol deposits also can occur on the eyelids, where they are called xanthelasmas.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask if anyone in your family has had coronary artery disease, high cholesterol or diabetes. The doctor will ask about your diet and if you have ever smoked. He or she will check your blood pressure and look for xanthomas and xanthelasmas. Your doctor can confirm a diagnosis of high cholesterol with a simple blood test.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Your doctor will ask if anyone in your family has had coronary artery disease, high cholesterol or diabetes. The doctor will ask about your diet and if you have ever smoked. He or she will check your blood pressure and look for xanthomas and xanthelasmas. Your doctor can confirm a diagnosis of high cholesterol with a simple blood test.\n",
      "Prevention": "You may help to prevent high cholesterol by staying on a healthy diet and exercising daily. Avoid processed foods, especially those that contain saturated fats. Instead eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, and low-fat dairy products.\n",
      "Treatment": "The initial treatment of high cholesterol should always be lifestyle changes. This means altering your diet and getting more exercise. Some people respond dramatically to dietary changes.\n",
      "Diet": "There is no consensus on the best diet. The most effective diet to lower total and LDL cholesterol is a vegetarian diet. However, this is not an easy diet to follow.\nMany people prefer a \"Mediterranean style\" diet. There is no strict definition for what should be included in this type of diet. In general, this means\nTo maintain a desirable weight, you should take in only as many calories as you burn each day. If you need to lose weight, you need to take in fewer calories than you burn.\nPeople who aren't sure how to follow such a diet may find it useful to work with a health care professional such as a dietitian, nutritionist, doctor, or nurse.\nIn addition to dietary changes, you should get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, daily.\n",
      "Medications": "Whether you need medication to lower your cholesterol level depends on how you respond to diet and your personal risk of heart attack and stroke. Doctors primarily prescribe medications to lower LDL cholesterol, and most often a statin drug is  the first choice to lower LDL cholesterol.\nStatins are also called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. They include lovastatin (Mevacor), simvastatin (Zocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), fluvastatin (Lescol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Statins block an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which is necessary for the production of cholesterol.\nStatins do much more than lower your LDL cholesterol number. They lower your risk of developing hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and reduce the chance that you will have a heart attack or stroke.\nWhen a person taking a statin does not reach goal, doctors sometimes add ezetimibe. Ezetimibe inhibits absorption of cholesterol from the intestine. By itself the brand name drug is called Zetia. When combined with simvastatin, it's known as Vytorin.\nNewer LDL cholesterol lowering therapies include:\nBempedoic acid.Like statins, bempedoic acid comes as a pill and works by interfering in the same cholesterol pathway. Taken alone, bempedoic acid lowers LDL by about 25%. Bempedoic acid is also available in combination with ezetimibe, sold under the trade name Nexlizet.\nPCSK9 inhibitors.They are more potent than statins and combined with a statin dramatically lower blood LDL cholesterol levels. The PCSK9 inhibitors target the protein known as PCSK9, which is made in the liver and regulates LDL. The original ones use antibodies to grab on to and block PCSK9 after it's been made.PCSK9 inhibitors are much more expensive than most statins. Also they are not available as pills. They must be injected.\nInclisiran.Like the current PCSK9 inhibitors, inclisiran slashes LDL levels by about 50%. Both types of drugs target the protein known as PCSK9, which is made in the liver and regulates LDL. However, inclisiran has a different mechanism of action. It interferes with PCSK9's genetic blueprint, preventing the protein from being made in the first place. Another difference: the first two PCSK9 inhibitors must be injected once or twice a month, while inclisiran requires just two injections per year.\nPCSK9 inhibitors and inclisiran are most useful for people with familial hypercholesterolemia. These people have extremely high cholesterol levels. People with coronary artery disease who either don't reach goal with a high dose statin drug or cannot tolerate statins because of side effects may also be candidates for one of these newer therapies.\nIn addition to dietary changes or medication, people with high cholesterol should try to control their other risk factors for coronary artery disease. This means keeping blood pressure at normal levels, not smoking, controlling your blood sugar, maintaining or losing weight and following a regular exercise schedule.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Because it is possible to have high cholesterol for many years without symptoms, it is important to have your blood cholesterol level checked periodically. Current guidelines recommend that adults older than 20 undergo a full lipid profile once every five years. This test measures LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If the numbers are outside the desirable range, your doctor may suggest that you change your diet and monitor your cholesterol more frequently.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The effectiveness of following a healthy diet and using medications to lower cholesterol varies from person to person. On average, diet and exercise can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%. Medications can lower LDL cholesterol by another 20% to more than 50%\n",

      "What is a hip fracture?": "The hip is the joint between the upper end of the thighbone (femur) and its socket in the pelvis. When a hip fractures (breaks), the injury is always in the femur. The upper end of the femur can fracture in any one of three places:\nFalling is the most common cause of hip fractures. Usually, this occurs in people older than 50. Older people are at risk of hip fractures because of osteoporosis, a disease that weakens bones and may be age-related. A hip also may be fractured during trauma, such as an automobile accident.\nDoctors label fractures according to how far the bone has moved from its original position (its displacement). Fractures can be:\n",
      "Symptoms of hip fracture": "A hip fracture can cause hip pain, swelling, or bruising, and the hip may look deformed. It may be difficult to move the hip, especially turning the foot outwards or bending at the hip. The fracture may make the hip seem too weak to lift the leg. People usually have pain in the groin when they put weight on the hip. Walking or even standing can cause the fracture to spread, which may worsen the pain. In severe cases, a person with a hip fracture is in too much pain to move. In rare cases, usually in people who are bed-bound and do not put weight on their hips, a hip fracture may not cause any symptoms.\n",
      "Diagnosing hip fracture": "If your doctor suspects you have a hip fracture, an x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan can confirm the diagnosis. Occasionally, additional x-rays or a CT scan are needed to spot small fractures.\n",
      "Expected duration of hip fracture": "The amount of time it takes to recover from a hip fracture depends on the type of fracture and how it is treated. When pins and screws are required to secure the bone, the person should try to resume walking with a walker as soon as possible. It may take six to eight weeks before the person can switch to walking with a cane.\nRecovering from hip-replacement surgery can take even longer, up to 12 weeks. In as many as two out of three cases, people with a hip fracture require long-term assistance with one or more basic daily activities.\nIn up to 25% of cases, older people with hip fractures are no longer able to live independently even after they recover. The loss of independence is not all related to the hip fracture itself. Many people who suffer hip fractures are frail and have significant medical problems before the fracture occurs. They are more likely than otherwise healthy people to have complications from the fracture and its treatment.\n",
      "Preventing hip fracture": "There are two main ways to prevent a hip fracture: Maintain bone strength and prevent falls.\nTo optimize bone strength, men and women of all ages should exercise regularly and consume enough calcium and vitamin D.\nThe bones of women are more likely to thin as they age. A special x-ray test, called a bone mineral density test, can identify people with osteoporosis.\nAfter menopause, women with risk factors for osteoporosis (including a strong family history of osteoporosis, a bone fracture as an adult, corticosteroid use, or smoking) should consider having a bone mineral density test, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Women ages 65 and older and men ages 70 and older, with or without extra risks for osteoporosis, should also have the test.\nIf bone density testing reveals low bone density, your doctor may recommend medication, especially if there has been a fracture after minor trauma. A number of medications are available to prevent osteoporosis and related fractures, including:\nA doctor should evaluate people who fall frequently. Some causes of falling can be identified and treated. In some cases, improving home safety can help to prevent falls. Grab bars, nonslip rug liners, adequate lighting, and bedside toilet equipment may be helpful for some people. Your doctor can provide additional advice about how to prevent falls, such as exercises to improve strength and balance.\nHip protector pads may provide some protection in the event of a fall, but many people find them difficult to wear and studies have not demonstrated a significant benefit.\n",
      "Treating hip fracture": "Treatment depends on the location of the fracture, the degree of displacement, the number of other fractures, and the age of the person. A hip fracture usually is treated with surgery. In recent years, less invasive operations have been developed.\nFracture of the femoral head or neck:If the fracture is not displaced, the bones may be secured with pins and screws during minor surgery. Sometimes metal plates are used. A displaced fracture usually requires a hip replacement, a major operation. In hip replacement surgery, the damaged femoral head is replaced with a metal or ceramic ball, which fits into an artificial socket that is cemented in place.\n\nFracture between the trochanters:Initial treatment usually includes traction, which involves the use of weights and pulleys to stretch and extend the muscles around the hip. Traction prevents the muscles that are attached to the trochanters from pulling the two sides of the fractured bone in different directions during the time it takes for the fracture to heal.\nFor people who participate in regular activity before an injury, traction should be followed by surgery to insert pins and screws into the hip to stabilize the broken bone. These people should begin to move the joint as early as possible after the pins and screws are placed.\nThis type of surgery may be too traumatic for people who were bedridden before the fracture. In those cases, the fractured bone should be kept immobilized. This immobilization may last four to eight weeks.\nFracture below the trochanters:Surgery involves placing a long metal rod in the shaft of the thighbone to realign the break. In young children, traction and a full leg cast may be all that is needed.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience prolonged or severe hip pain after a fall, call your doctor for an urgent evaluation. If you think you may have fractured a hip, try to stay as still as possible and get help immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Hip fractures are always serious. They are a major source of disability and can result in life-threatening complications. Approximately 4% of people die after a hip fracture because of complications from the fracture, its surgical treatment, or from medical consequences from having to be immobilized.\nImmobility can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the leg veins, a problem that can lead to a life-threatening complication called pulmonary embolus. Pneumonia is also common in immobile patients. Immobility can cause bedsores in the buttock or ankle area, and bedsores can develop infections.\nA fractured hip can cause sustained disability in many cases. However, in most cases, surgery is successful, and people can walk and resume normal activities with few restrictions.\nFractures of the femoral head can cause an additional complication by injuring the blood vessels that supply blood to the upper part of the femur. This type of injury can impair healing and lead to death of the bone, called osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head occurs in about 10% of people who fracture a hip, but in up to 30% of those whose hip fracture is displaced.\n",

      "What is it?": "Hirsutism is excessive hair growth in certain areas of a woman's face and body, such as the mustache and beard area, that creates a \"male pattern\" of hair. Women normally can have fine, pale, faintly visible hair in these areas, but heavy hair growth in a male pattern with coarse or colored hair is not expected.\nNormal patterns of hair growth and hair distribution vary widely, determined mostly by racial background. For example, whites as a group have more facial and non-scalp hair growth than do blacks or Asians, and white women of Mediterranean heritage normally have more hair growth than do women from Nordic countries.\nHirsutism in women means that hair follicles are being over-stimulated by testosterone or other androgen hormones. Androgens are the dominant sex hormones in men. Women normally have low levels of androgens. Hirsutism can be caused by abnormally high levels of androgens or abnormal stimulation of hair follicles even when androgen levels are normal.\nIn some cases, the extra androgen comes from medications  such as certain progestins used in some brands of birth control pills  or bodybuilding steroids that contain androgens or have some effects similar to androgens. Other medicines may indirectly cause the body to manufacture extra androgen hormones. These include some medicines to treat nausea, schizophrenia, agitation, epileptic seizures, migraine headaches, bipolar disorder, aggression and high blood pressure, as well as estrogens and opiate medications.\nOccasionally, the overproduction of androgen hormones is caused by an abnormality in the ovaries, the adrenal glands or the pituitary gland of the brain.\nSome excessive hair growth does not fit the pattern of growth triggered by androgen hormones (for example, hair between the eyes, on the forehead, on the temples or high on the cheeks of the face). This hair growth, called hypertrichosis, can be caused by thyroid problems or by anorexia nervosa. It also can result from long-term use of certain oral medications, including cyclosporin (Neoral, Sandimmune, SangCya), phenytoin (Dilantin), minoxidil (Loniten), and penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen).\n",
      "Symptoms": "A woman with the mildest form of hirsutism may notice significant growth of hair that is mature (the same color as scalp hair) on the upper lip, chin, sideburn area, around the nipples or lower abdomen. More advanced hirsutism will cause mature hair to grow on the upper back, shoulders, sternum and upper abdomen. It most often begins during puberty. If hirsutism starts before or after puberty, the cause could be hormonal and the woman should be evaluated by a doctor.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about your medical history with special attention to your menstrual cycles. He or she also will examine you. If you have a normal cyclic pattern of menstrual periods, the hirsutism is most likely genetic (inherited). If your menstrual cycles are irregular and have always been irregular, the cause could be polycystic ovary syndrome.\nIf the hirsutism and menstrual irregularity are new, you will need to be evaluated for a potentially more serious condition, such as a tumor of the ovary, adrenal glands or pituitary gland. This is especially important is you are skipping periods. If you have mild hirsutism and don't have any symptoms that suggest you are significantly overproducing androgen hormones, you may not need any additional testing.\nIf you need more testing, you are likely to have several blood tests:\nDepending on the results of these tests, your doctor may order additional hormone tests to help clarify the reason you are producing too much androgen by evaluating the function of your adrenal gland and pituitary gland. In some cases, your doctor will want to see a picture of one or more organs. Commonly used tests are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the adrenal glands or an ultrasound of the ovaries.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Most causes of hirsutism create a tendency to have lifelong excessive hair growth. However, many women will have a satisfactory response to medical treatment if they continue the therapy for several months or longer. A few causes of hirsutism (such as tumors that produce androgen hormones or tumors in the pituitary gland) can be cured with surgical treatment, radiation or both.\nCosmetic treatments can remove unwanted hair temporarily, and may limit hair regrowth in treated areas.\n",
      "Prevention": "Most causes of hirsutism are beyond a woman's control. You should avoid unnecessary medicines that are known to cause hirsutism.\n",
      "Treatment": "If a specific cause of hirsutism is diagnosed, your doctor may suggest appropriate treatment for that cause. For women who are overweight, losing weight may reduce androgen levels and improve hirsutism. For all women with hirsutism, cosmetic treatments and medical treatments that decrease the levels of androgens or their impact on hair follicles can be helpful:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have excessive, male-pattern hair growth or unusually rapid growth of male-pattern hair in a short period of time, you should see a medical professional. Also discuss hirsutism with a doctor if you have any symptoms of overproduction of androgens:\nDiscuss hirsutism with your doctor if you have other symptoms that may suggest an underlying problem in the ovaries, adrenal glands or pituitary gland, including:\nBecause some medical problems resulting in hirsutism run in families, talk to your doctor if you have these symptoms, even if your hirsutism is typical for your female relatives.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most cases of hirsutism can be treated successfully with medication and cosmetic attention. It may require time and persistent use of these therapies, but most cases will respond to a combined approach.\n",

      "What is HIV/AIDS?": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) weakens the body's immune defenses by destroying CD4 (T-cell) lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. T-cells normally help guard the body against attacks by bacteria, viruses and other germs.\nWhen HIV destroys CD4 cells, the body becomes vulnerable to many different types of infections. These infections are called opportunistic because usually they only have the opportunity to invade the body when the immune defenses are weak. HIV infection also increases the risk of certain cancers, illnesses of the brain and nerves, body wasting, and death.\nThe range of symptoms and illnesses that can happen when HIV infection severely weakens the body's immune defenses is called acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS.\nSince 1981, when doctors first recognized HIV/AIDS as a new illness, scientists have learned much about how a person becomes infected with HIV. The virus is spread through contact with an infected person's body fluids, especially through blood, semen and vaginal fluids. HIV can be transmitted:\nOnce inside the body, HIV particles invade CD4 cells and use the cells' own building machinery and materials to produce billions of new HIV particles. These new particles cause the infected CD4 cells to burst (lyse). The new particles can then enter the bloodstream and infect other cells.\nOnce someone is infected with HIV, the number of their CD4 cells continues to decrease. HIV is actively copying itself and killing CD4 cells from the time the infection starts. Eventually, the number of CD4 cells drops below the threshold level needed to defend the body against infections, and the person develops AIDS.\nMillions of people worldwide who have HIV don't know they are infected. It is important for people infected with HIV to know their status so they can get medical treatment before AIDS develops and they can take steps to prevent passing the virus to someone else.\n",
      "Symptoms of HIV/AIDS": "In its early stages, HIV infection often causes transient flu-like symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, rash, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, headaches, and joint pain. Doctors call this acute HIV infection.\nThe symptoms of acute HIV can be mild. So, the person or doctor may attribute the symptoms to a routine cold or flu. In a small number of cases, this early stage of infection may progress to meningitis (inflammation of membranes covering the brain) or severe flulike symptoms that require hospitalization.\nWithout treatment, the number of CD4 cells almost always declines. During this time, the person may begin to develop swollen lymph nodes and skin problems, such as varicella-zoster (shingles), seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff), new or worsening psoriasis, and minor infections. Ulcers can develop around the mouth and herpes outbreaks (oral or genital) may become more frequent.\nOver the next few years, as more CD4 cells continue to die, skin problems and mouth ulcers develop more often. Many people develop diarrhea, fever, unexplained weight loss, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue. Old tuberculosis infections may reactivate even before AIDS develops. (Tuberculosis is one of the most common HIV/AIDS-related infections in the developing world.)\nFinally, with further decreases in the levels of CD4 cells, the person develops AIDS. For an HIV-infected person, some signs that AIDS has developed (known as AIDS-defining conditions) are:\n",
      "Diagnosing HIV/AIDS": "Your doctor will ask about possible HIV risk factors, such as previous sexual partners, intravenous drug use, blood transfusion and occupational exposure to blood, such as accidentally being stuck by needles. Your doctor might ask about a variety of symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, muscle and joint aches, fatigue and headache, and about medical problems you may have had in the past like sexually transmitted infections or hepatitis.\nThis typically is followed by a complete physical examination. During the exam, your doctor will look for a thick, white coating on your tongue called thrush (infection with Candida), any skin abnormalities and swollen lymph nodes. To make the diagnosis of HIV infection, however, laboratory tests are needed.\nTesting for HIV can be done in one of several ways. The most commonly used blood tests check the HIV antibody, the p24 antigen, and/or the HIV RNA viral load. These tests can detect the presence of infection within 7 to 14 days of exposure.\n",
      "Expected duration of HIV/AIDS": "HIV infection is a lifelong illness. There is no known cure for HIV. However, advances in treatment have changed the thinking about HIV as a fatal disease. Doctors now consider HIV a chronic condition that can be controlled with medications and healthy life style choices.\n",
      "Preventing HIV/AIDS": "HIV infection can be passed from person to person in any of the following ways:\nThere is no evidence that HIV can be spread through the following: kissing; sharing food utensils, towels or bedding; swimming in pools; using toilet seats; using telephones; or having mosquito or other insect bites. Casual contact in the home, workplace or public spaces poses no risk of HIV transmission.\nAlthough several HIV vaccines are being tested, none has been approved. You can decrease your chances of being infected with HIV by avoiding high-risk behaviors. To decrease the risk of HIV infection:\nFor sexually active people who are HIV negative and have an increased risk of becoming infected with the virus, talk to your doctor about medication options for prevention.\n",
      "Treating HIV/AIDS": "Today, most experts recommend starting treatment immediately after the diagnosis is confirmed. But there may be individual circumstances why a person may choose to wait.\nIf the decision is made to start treatment, your doctor will choose a combination of drugs called antiretrovirals to fight your HIV infection. To control the reproduction of HIV in the body, several medications must be used together (often called a drug cocktail or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). These medications attack HIV at multiple points in its growth cycle and are more effective in suppressing the virus. Combining drugs also limits the risk that HIV will become resistant to drugs, which would mean the drugs are powerless against this resistant strain of HIV.\nMany studies have shown that people with high levels of virus in the blood (the viral load) will progress more rapidly to AIDS. Though it is not possible to clear the virus from the body completely, the goal of treatment is to keep the virus from reproducing. This can be seen when the viral load test cannot detected the HIV virus in the bloodstream (the virus never goes away, just goes to very low levels). When the virus is not reproducing quickly, it is less likely to kill CD4 cells. As the CD4 cell count increases, the immune system regains strength.\nThere are many available antiretroviral medications in the United States today. Many of these can be prescribed in combination form. Some have two or three names. They may be referred to by the generic name, trade name or a three letter abbreviation.\nIt is very important to tell your doctor about ALL other medications you take (including herbals and non-prescription medications) because there can be serious drug-drug interactions with commonly used medications. Also, no one should take an antiretroviral medication that was not specifically prescribed for them by a health care provider.\nIn addition to antiretrovirals, people with low CD4 counts often need to take drugs to prevent the development of opportunistic infections. For example, people with low CD4 cell counts could take trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or other medication to protect themselves againstPneumocystispneumonia.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Your doctor can help you protect yourself against HIV. Let your doctor know if you are a man who has sex with men or if you share needles with anyone for any reason (intravenous drugs or steroids, for example). If you are a woman and think your male partner may have risk factors for HIV infection, please let your doctor know. Your doctor can give you information about how to reduce your risk of HIV.\nYou should also speak with your doctor if you think you may already have HIV infection so that you can be tested for the disease. If you have long-lasting headache, cough, diarrhea, skin sores or are having fevers or losing weight, let your doctor know. Even without any symptoms, the sooner you get tested for HIV, the sooner appropriate treatment can be started than can help you live a long, healthy life.\nCall your doctor immediately if you believe that you have been exposed to the body fluids of someone who has HIV or AIDS. If your exposure is felt to be significant, your doctor may recommend that you take antiretrovirals that may decrease your risk of getting HIV/AIDS. These drugs work best when they are taken within 72 hours (3 days) of the exposure.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Today, the life expectancy for many people with HIV is close to that of people that don't have the infection. The outlook is especially good for those who begin antiretrovirals at an early stage of the disease.\nIf you are infected with HIV, it is best to find out as soon as possible so that treatment can be started before the immune system is weakened. Since potent antiretrovirals became available in the United States, the number of AIDS-related deaths and hospitalizations has decreased dramatically.\n",

      "What are hives?": "Hives, also called urticaria, are circumscribed swellings on the skin that often are itchy. Often they are pink or red, but they don't have to be. Hives happen when the cells in the skin called mast cells release histamine, a chemical that causes tiny blood vessels (capillaries) to leak fluid. When this leaking fluid accumulates in the skin, it forms the swellings that we recognize as hives.\nHives can be triggered by physical factors such as heat, cold, exercise, sunlight, stress, sustained pressure on a skin area (such as from a belt or shoulder strap), a sudden increase in body temperature (from a fever or a hot bath or shower) or from an irritating chemical, cosmetic or soap applied to the skin. Hives also can be one symptom of a whole-body (systemic) allergic reaction to something that was:\nHives probably affect about 20% of people in the United States at some time in life, with the greatest number of episodes occurring in people aged 20 to 30. In rare cases, allergic reactions that trigger hives set off a chain reaction throughout the body, resulting in a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. Sometimes, hives last for six weeks or more, a condition called chronic (or idiopathic) urticaria. Often, no cause is found for this chronic condition, and it usually goes away on its own after several weeks.\n",
      "Symptoms of hives": "Hives appear as \"wheals\" (swellings) on the skin, sometimes pink or red and surrounded by a red blotch. Typically round or oval, hives often itch. Hives vary in size, and some may blend to form larger areas of swelling. Hives can affect skin on any area of the body, especially the trunk, thighs, upper arms and face. Most individual hives fade quickly, but new crops may appear every 24 to 72 hours if the person continues to be exposed to the environment or substance that triggered the hives.\n\nIf hives are an early sign of a whole-body reaction, other symptoms to look for include swelling of the tongue, lips or face; wheezing; dizziness; chest tightness; and breathing difficulties. If these symptoms occur, get immediate medical attention. You could be developing anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition.\n",
      "Diagnosing hives": "Your doctor will ask about your history of allergic reactions, and about your recent exposure to pets, plants, insects or new foods or medications. During a physical examination, your doctor usually can distinguish between hives and other types of skin rashes. Also, he or she will check for other signs of a serious allergic reaction.\nIf the condition occurs frequently, your doctor may order blood tests or perform skin testing for allergies. If your doctor suspects that you are undergoing anaphylaxis, he or she will begin treatment immediately and closely monitor your blood pressure and breathing.\n",
      "Expected duration of hives": "Individual hives usually fade within eight to 12 hours, but recurrent hives can continue to reappear for weeks or months. In cases of chronic urticaria (hives), the condition may last for six months or more.\n",
      "Preventing hives": "You can prevent hives by identifying and avoiding the particular circumstance or substance that triggered your skin reaction. If your doctor determines that you are allergic to insect venom, you may be advised to keep an epinephrine kit for emergency injections to prevent anaphylaxis. Keep the medicine in a convenient place if you work outside or play a sport. Keep an antihistamine in your medicine cabinet and take it the first signs of hives or itching. Older adults and people with heart disease should double check with their doctor before taking antihistamines.\n",
      "Treating hives": "To relieve most uncomplicated episodes of hives, your doctor may suggest a lotion such as Sarna or an antihistamine, such as cetirizine (Zyrtec, others) or loratadine (Claritin, others). There are many over-the-counter antihistamines available. Generic versions work as well as the brand name drugs. It is critical to relieve the itching because scratching can stimulate more hives and itching.\nIf these medications are not effective, you may be given a prescription medication such as cyproheptadine (Periactin) hydroxyzine (Atarax or Vistaril) or desloratadine (Clarinex).\nFor cases that are even more resistant to treatment, H2 receptor blockers might be added. These include nizatidine (Axid), famotidine (Pepcid) or cimetidine (Tagamet). Doxepin (Adapin, Sinequan) before bed is particularly helpful for people having a difficulty sleeping because of the itching.\nWhen other options fail, medications that suppress or alter the immune system may be prescribed. These include omalizumab (Xolair), montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) or corticosteroids (such as prednisone).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if hives appear after you have started taking a new medication or after you have been stung by an insect. Get emergency treatment if hives occur with wheezing, dizziness, chest tightness, breathing difficulties or swelling of the tongue, lips or face.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most simple cases of hives fade quickly, and the affected skin returns to normal within hours. Even when you have episodes that recur over several weeks, without a known cause, they often stop coming back after a few months. Consult your doctor if hives persist for several days or if itching interferes with your ability to sleep or perform normal daily activities.\n",

      "What are hot flashes?": "A hot flash is a brief feeling of intense warmth and sweating. Hot flashes commonly occur in women around the time of menopause.\nResearchers do not know exactly what causes hot flashes. Current theories suggest hot flashes are due to a menopause-related drop in the body's level of female hormones called estrogens. This drop affects the hypothalamus, an area of the brain that regulates body temperature.\nIn a hot flash, the hypothalamus seems to sense that your body is too hot even when it is not, and tells the body to release the excess heat. One way the body does this is to widen (dilate) blood vessels, particularly those near the skin of the head, face, neck and chest. Once the blood vessels return to normal size, you feel cool again.\nHot flashes affect about 85% of women during the years immediately before and after menopause. Menopause usually occurs around age 51, but hot flashes can begin as early as 2 to 3 years before the last menstrual period.\nHot flashes can last for 6 months to as long as 15 years after the final period. The average is two years. Some women have only a few episodes a year, while others have as many as 20 episodes a day.\nHot flashes occur in women who experience natural menopause, as well as in women who undergo menopause because their ovaries have been removed surgically or because they take medications that lower estrogen levels. These medications include gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, such as leuprolide (Lupron) or danazol (Danocrine) that lower estrogen levels.\nAlthough hot flashes usually are considered a female problem, men can have hot flashes if their levels of the male sex hormone testosterone drop suddenly and dramatically. For example, hot flashes occur in 75% of men with prostate cancer who have surgery to remove the testes (orchiectomy) or who take medication to decrease testosterone levels.\nSymptoms that mimic hot flashes can occur in both men and women who have a tumor of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, certain serious infections such as tuberculosis or HIV, alcoholism or thyroid disorders. Symptoms that are similar to hot flashes also can be a side effect of the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG), or of certain medications, particularly nitroglycerin (sold under many brand names), nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat), niacin (numerous brand names), vancomycin (Vancocin) and calcitonin (Calcimar, Cibacalcin, Miacalcin).\n",
      "Symptoms of hot flashes": "A hot flash begins as a sensation of intense warmth in the upper body, followed by skin redness (flushing), drenching perspiration, and finally a cold, clammy feeling. Typically, these symptoms begin at the head and spread downward toward the neck and chest. They last from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. The average is 4 minutes.\nHot flashes can be accompanied by other uncomfortable sensations, such as heart palpitations, a pressure feeling in the head, or feelings of dizziness, faintness or weakness. When hot flashes occur during the night, they can cause sleeplessness (insomnia), resulting in poor concentration, memory problems, irritability and exhaustion during the day.\n\n",
      "Diagnosing hot flashes": "After noting your age, your doctor will ask you whether you are still having regular menstrual periods. If you are not, your doctor will ask the approximate date of your last period. If you are still menstruating, the doctor will want to know whether there is anything unusual about the timing of your periods or the amount of blood flow.\nYour doctor will ask whether you are experiencing any other symptoms that may be related to decreased estrogen, such as vaginal dryness, pain or discomfort during intercourse or urinary incontinence. Finally, your doctor will review your medical history, your gynecological history and the types of medications you are taking. This is to make sure your symptoms are hot flashes and not the result of a medical or gynecological illness or a side effect of medication.\nIn most cases, your doctor can confirm that your hot flashes are related to menopause by reviewing your menstrual history and conducting a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. Your doctor may order a blood test to measure serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which are high during menopause.\n",
      "Expected duration of hot flashes": "In most women who undergo natural menopause, hot flashes subside within 2 to 5 years after the last menstrual period. In a small number of women, however, hot flashes can continue for 8 to 15 years after the last menstrual period.\nThere is some evidence that women who go through menopause due to surgery may have more severe hot flashes for more years than women who go through natural menopause.\n",
      "Preventing hot flashes": "Hot flashes related to menopause cannot be prevented. However, the following lifestyle changes may help to make hot flashes less severe or less frequent:\n",
      "Treating hot flashes": "Estrogen is the most effective medication available to relieve hot flashes. Short-term use of low-dose estrogen may be prescribed, with or without progesterone. If a woman still has her uterus, estrogen is usually prescribed together with progesterone to decrease the small risk of uterine cancer. Estrogen used alone causes growth of the uterine lining. Adding progesterone prevents or decreases this growth, thereby decreasing the risk of developing uterine cancer. If your uterus was removed, then only estrogen is required.\nEstrogen can be taken as a pill or administered through a skin patch to treat hot flashes. Estrogen can be applied directly to the vagina as a cream, suppository, or a ring to treat vaginal symptoms.  Progesterone can be taken as a pill or a patch or as a vaginal suppository. Women who use estrogen should use the smallest dose that relieves hot flashes.\nA new class of non-hormonal drugs known as neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) antagonists have been shown to decrease the frequency and severity of hot flashes. Fezolinetant (VEOZAH) is the first NK3r to receive FDA approval.\nOther alternative medications to help decrease the intensity of hot flashes include clonidine (Catapres), gabapentin (Neurontin), or antidepressants such as venlafaxine (Effexor), paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). For women who have undergone surgical menopause and have unusually severe hot flashes, some studies have shown that a combination of estrogen and androgen may be effective.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your family doctor or gynecologist if hot flashes bother you at home or at work, prevent you from getting a good night's sleep, cause you serious discomfort or otherwise interfere with your quality of life.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In more than 95% of women, the use of low-dose estrogen medication is effective in treating hot flashes. However, it may take two to four weeks of treatment before improvement is noticeable. With or without using estrogen, hot flashes gradually diminish and disappear completely with time.\n",

      "What is HPV?": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes common warts, the small, white, beige, or brown skin growths that can appear almost anywhere on the body, and on the moist mucous membranes near the mouth, anus, and genitals.\nThere are more than 150 different types of HPV, each with its own favorite skin surface to invade. Some cause the small, painless, rough-surfaced warts found on the fingers and face. Others cause the larger, more painful and flatter plantar warts that grow on the soles of the feet. More than 40 different types of HPV can infect the skin covering the sex organs, cervix and opening of the anus.\nGenital HPV infections are very common. Up to 80 percent of sexually active adults will get an HPV infection of the genital area at some point in their lives. In most cases, these infections do not cause symptoms. They can cause genital warts.\nIn a small number of women, certain HPV strains cause changes in the cervix that can become cancerous if not treated. HPV is also linked to cancers of the penis, vagina, anus, vulva, and also to mouth and throat cancers. HPV subtypes 16 and 18 are the causes of most cancers. HPV types 6 and 11 cause most cases of genital warts.\nHuman papillomaviruses usually are spread by direct skin contact, such as shaking the hand of someone who has a wart on their finger or having sexual intercourse with someone who has a genital HPV infection. Genital HPV infections can be spread by people with no symptoms.\nLess often, the viruses are carried on surfaces touched by someone who has warts, especially inside shoes that have been worn by someone with plantar warts. Once a person has been infected with an HPV, symptoms usually take three to four months to develop. However, in some cases, warts have developed as long as two years after contact with an infected person or contaminated surface.\nHealth experts estimate that common warts can be found on the hands of about one-fourth of all people in the United States, especially children. For some unknown reason, plantar warts are most common among teenagers and young adults.\n",
      "Symptoms of HPV": "It is possible to have an HPV skin or genital infection without having symptoms. When an HPV infection does cause a wart, the appearance varies slightly depending on its location:\nCancer caused by HPV often causes no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, it depends on the location of the cancer:\n",
      "Diagnosing HPV": "Your doctor usually can diagnose warts by examining the area. By looking at the area, your doctor also can determine what treatment may be necessary. In general warts don't need to be biopsied. However, if your doctor is concerned that the changes could be cancerous, a skin biopsy may be needed. In a biopsy, a small piece of tissue is removed and examined under a microscope.\nPeople with plantar warts may complain of pain on the bottom of their feet when walking. If you have possible plantar warts, your doctor will examine your affected foot. He or she will want to be sure there are no bone, joint or tendon problems that would explain the pain. Plantar warts might not be the actual cause of foot pain.\nIf you have possible genital warts, your doctor will ask about your sexual practices, including condom use and anal sex. Condoms help decrease the risk of getting infected with HPV and spreading it to partners. But the HPV might exist on areas not covered by a condom. If you engage in anal sex, your doctor will examine the area around and inside the anus for warts and other skin changes from HPV. If you engage in oral sex, your doctor can look for sores or discolored areas on your tongue and inside your mouth.\nIn women with genital warts, the doctor will do a pelvic and rectal exam. A Pap smear will be done to look for microscopic pre-cancer or early cancer of the cervix caused by HPV.\nYour doctor may also do colposcopy to get a more detailed look at the surface of the cervix and vagina. This tube-like instrument has a light and lenses to give the doctor a magnified view of the cervix and nearby vaginal skin. A biopsy of abnormal cervical tissue may be necessary to look for cervical cancer.\nDNA tests can identify the specific types of HPV infection in cells taken from a woman's cervix. The test helps to identify women who have the types of HPV infection associated with the development of cervical cancer.\nWomen ages 30 and over can opt for cervical cancer screening with HPV testing combined with a PAP smear once every 5 years (if prior PAP smears have been normal).\n",
      "Expected duration of HPV": "Many warts disappear on their own. This may take one or two years. Others last for longer periods.\n",
      "Preventing HPV": "There are two FDA approved vaccines against human papillomavirus, Gardasil and Cervarix. HPV vaccine works best when given before any exposure to HPV.\nThe general recommendation is to vaccinate 11 and 12 year old girls and boys with either vaccine, but vaccination may start at age 9. Vaccination should also be considered for adolescents and young adults if not adequately vaccinated when younger. Ideally, girls and young women should get all three HPV doses prior to becoming sexually active.\nHPV vaccination is given as a series of either two or three doses, depending on age at initial vaccination.\nHPV vaccination prevents new HPV infections but does not treat existing HPV infections or diseases. Most sexually active adults have already been exposed to HPV, although not necessarily all of the HPV types targeted by vaccination. At any age, having a new sex partner is a risk factor for getting a new HPV infection.\nOther than abstinence, there is no definite way to prevent all HPV infections. To lower your risk as much as possible, always use condoms and other barrier methods, such as dental dams for mouth-to-genital contact, for protection. If you or someone you know has a wart, avoid skin-to-skin contact with the wart.\n",
      "Treating HPV": "Over-the-counter ointments, lotions and plasters are available to treat common skin warts. Do not use them for warts on the face, genitals or anus. They should not be used by people with diabetes, poor circulation or infected warts. Over-the-counter remedies use strong chemicals to slowly destroy the wart over a period of weeks or months. For faster and more lasting treatment, your doctor may try several procedures, including:\nA doctor should always examine warts on the face, genitals and anus. In some cases, the doctor will prescribe a medication such as podofilox (Condylox) or imiquimod (Aldara), which you can apply to the wart yourself. In other cases, you doctor will use an office-based treatment, such as:\nSeveral office visits may be necessary to complete your treatment.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment with your doctor whenever you suspect that you have a wart on your face, genitals or anus. If you have a wart on another area, you can try nonprescription treatments on your own, and see the doctor only if home treatment does not work.\nIf you are older than 45, talk to your doctor before trying to remove a common wart with an over-the-counter remedy. Your doctor may want to test for skin cancer.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook varies. Many common warts disappear without treatment over 6 to 12 months. Others dissolve when an over-the-counter remedy is used for several weeks or months.\nOf the office-based therapies, surgical removal of a wart gives the best immediate results, because the wart is cut away in one doctor's visit. Other forms of therapy require several office visits. After a wart has been removed, there is no guarantee that it will not come back, because it is difficult to be certain that HPV infection has been eliminated from the deeper layers of the infected skin. Some stubborn warts require several rounds of treatment before they go away for good.\n",

      "What is Huntington's disease?": "Huntington's disease causes certain nerve cells in the brain to stop working properly. It leads to mental deterioration and loss of control over major muscle movements. Typically, the symptoms of the illness begin between ages 35 and 50, although they can start as early as childhood or later in life.\nRegardless of at what age it starts, Huntington's disease worsens over time. It is an inherited (genetic) disease. Each child of a parent with Huntington's disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the illness.\nHuntington's disease is relatively uncommon. It affects people from all ethnic groups. The disease affects males and females equally.\n",
      "Symptoms of Huntington's disease": "Huntington's disease can affect:\nSymptoms vary from person to person. They also can change over time. They usually start as subtle differences and progress to profound disability.\nHuntington's disease is rare in children. In children, behavioral problems and mental deterioration are prominent. Rigidity and seizures are common. Huntington's disease progresses more rapidly in children than in adults.\n",
      "Diagnosing Huntington's disease": "The symptoms of Huntington's disease begin subtly. As a result, diagnosis may not be made until the disease has started to worsen.\nSomeone with a family history of Huntington's disease who has symptoms often is diagnosed based on a physical and neurological exam.\nA blood test can detect the gene that causes Huntington's disease. Everyone who carries the Huntington's gene eventually will develop the disease. The test cannot predict when symptoms will begin, or how severe they will be.\nGenetic testing carries enormous emotional and practical consequences. You should discuss these issues with your doctor. Some people choose to be tested so they can make informed decisions about the future. Other people choose not to be tested, knowing that they cannot do anything to affect whether they have inherited the defective gene.\nMany experts recommend that children under 18 should not get a genetic test. At 18, they can decide for themselves if they want to get tested.\nSome hospitals offer prenatal testing. If you have a family history of Huntington's disease, you can determine your risk of passing the gene to your children.\n",
      "Expected duration of Huntington's disease": "The gene that causes Huntington's disease is present from birth. Symptoms typically begin in midlife. They last until the end of life.\n",
      "Preventing Huntington's disease": "There is no way to prevent this disease in people who have inherited the genetic abnormality.\nIf you have a family history of Huntington's disease, you may choose to have a genetic test. This can help you to determine your chances of passing the gene on to your children.\n",
      "Treating Huntington's disease": "There is no treatment to cure Huntington's disease or slow its progression. Several treatments are being tested to see if they can at least slow the progression of the disease.\nTherapies can lessen the severity of symptoms. These include speech therapy and physical therapy.\nMedications can help to control mood and involuntary movements.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Discuss a family history of Huntington's disease with your doctor. Consider genetic testing to determine whether you carry the Huntington's gene. You also may want to understand the risks involved before having children.\nCall your doctor if you experience any problems with emotional control, intellectual ability or movement. Keep in mind that these symptoms are not specific to Huntington's disease.\n",
      "Prognosis": "There is no treatment to halt the progression of Huntington's disease.\nThe course of the disease varies from person to person. Some people have mild symptoms that progress slowly; others have severe symptoms at a young age.\nPeople who exercise and remain active tend to have milder symptoms. Their disease may also progress more slowly than those who do not remain active.\nHowever, everyone with Huntington's disease ultimately becomes severely debilitated. They have difficulty eating and swallowing. They become susceptible to infection. These complications usually cause death.\nFor adults, the time from the first symptoms until death is usually 10 to 20 years. In juvenile Huntington's disease, the disease progresses more rapidly. Death usually occurs within eight to 10 years of disease onset.\n",

      "What is hydrocephalus?": "Hydrocephalus, also known as \"water on the brain,\" is a condition in which there is extra cerebrospinal fluid around the brain and spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid acts as a cushion for the brain and spinal cord, supplies nutrients, and takes away waste products.\nHydrocephalus can be present at birth (congenital) or can develop later (acquired).\nHydrocephalus can be classified according to its cause:\nAnother type of hydrocephalus, called normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), is an acquired type of communicating hydrocephalus in which the ventricles are enlarged but not under high pressure. NPH is most common in older adults and may be suspected because of gait abnormalities, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. NPH may be the result of injury or illness, but in the majority of cases the cause is unknown.\nAnother type is called hydrocephalus ex-vacuo. A stroke or traumatic injury causes damage to the brain that causes brain tissue to shrink and the ventricles enlarge.\nPremature infants born before 34 weeks or weighing less than 4 pounds have a higher risk of blood vessels bleeding in the brain. Severe bleeding can lead to acquired hydrocephalus, communicating or non-communicating, depending on the site and extent of the bleeding.\n",
      "Symptoms of hydrocephalus": "The most common symptoms of hydrocephalus vary depending on the age of onset.\nIn infants, symptoms include\nIn older children and adults, symptoms include\nAt any age, symptoms include\n",
      "Diagnosing hydrocephalus": "Congenital hydrocephalus may be diagnosed during a routine prenatal ultrasound, but often is discovered during infancy or early childhood. A doctor may suspect hydrocephalus before other symptoms appear if an infant has a head that seems to be getting larger too rapidly, or is larger than would be expected given the baby's current weight or length. If the soft spot (anterior fontanelle) is still open, an ultrasound of the head can determine if the head is getting larger due to hydrocephalus.\nThe doctor will ask questions about the person's medical history, and he or she will perform a physical and neurological examination. Detailed pictures of the brain may be obtained with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If these pictures reveal hydrocephalus, the child or adult usually is referred to a neurosurgeon for further evaluation and treatment.\n",
      "Expected duration of hydrocephalus": "Although the symptoms may subside with treatment, the duration varies according to the type and cause of the hydrocephalus.\n",
      "Preventing hydrocephalus": "A few of the causes of hydrocephalus can be prevented:\n",
      "Treating hydrocephalus": "Treatment of hydrocephalus depends on its cause and severity. Occasionally, medications are used to slow the rate of cerebrospinal fluid production temporarily. However, this has not been successful for long-term treatment.\nMost cases require drainage of the excess fluid. A tube called a shunt is inserted into one of the cavities in the brain through a hole in the skull. The shunt is tunneled under the skin and carries the cerebrospinal fluid into another area of the body, such as the abdomen, where it can be absorbed.\nThe shunt may need to be replaced periodically as a child grows or if the shunt becomes infected or blocked.\nSome people with obstructive hydrocephalus can be treated with a technique called ventriculostomy, in which a neurosurgeon makes an incision at the site of the blockage to allow cerebrospinal fluid to drain past the obstruction.\nIn some cases, surgeons may recommend shunt placement for congenital hydrocephalus while the fetus is still inside the mother's womb (uterus).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment to arrange prenatal care with an obstetrical provider if you become pregnant. Call your doctor if you or your child develops symptoms of hydrocephalus or has a severe head injury.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the cause of hydrocephalus, and usually is better if the problem is diagnosed and treated early. If hydrocephalus gets worse rapidly or lasts a long time, it can cause brain damage and death.\nChildren with hydrocephalus are more likely to have various developmental disabilities. Even after treatment, many children with hydrocephalus have seizures, impaired intelligence, memory problems, and vision difficulties, including strabismus (abnormally aligned eyes). Children with hydrocephalus also may enter puberty earlier than normal.\nWith appropriate treatment, most infants with hydrocephalus survive and approximately one-third have normal cognitive function.\n",

      "What is it?": "Hyperkeratosis is a thickening of the outer layer of the skin. This outer layer contains a tough, protective protein called keratin.\nThis skin thickening is often part of the skin's normal protection against rubbing, pressure and other forms of local irritation. It causes calluses and corns on hands and feet. It can cause whitish areas inside the mouth.\nOther forms of hyperkeratosis can occur as part of the skin's defense against:\nLess often, hyperkeratosis develops on skin that has not been irritated. These types of hyperkeratosis may be part of an inherited condition. They may begin soon after birth and can affect skin on large areas of the body.\nThere are many examples of hyperkeratosis. They include:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Many forms of hyperkeratosis are painless. However, corns, calluses and plantar warts can cause a great deal of discomfort.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Depending on your specific pattern of skin symptoms, your doctor will ask whether you:\nSometimes, your doctor can diagnose the cause of your hyperkeratosis based on your history and symptoms and by examining your skin. This often is the case with corns, calluses, warts and chronic eczema.\nIf you have chronic eczema that could be allergy-related, the doctor may suggest allergy testing.\nIn some cases, a biopsy may be taken to confirm the diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of tissue is removed to be examined in a laboratory. If your doctor suspects actinic keratoses, you may need to have a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out skin cancer.\nIf your child develops many areas of hyperkeratosis, your doctor may review your family history and skin symptoms. This will help to determine if your child has an inherited disorder.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long a particular form of hyperkeratosis lasts depends on its cause. For example, corns and calluses usually last as long as a person continues to wear poorly fitting shoes. Warts may disappear on their own. But this may take several months.\nOnce they develop, actinic keratoses or seborrheic keratoses are long-term conditions. They do not disappear without treatment.\nInherited forms of hyperkeratosis are lifelong conditions.\n",
      "Prevention": "Some forms of hyperkeratosis are very easy to prevent:\nAlso, try using blankets and clothing made of cotton. Fabrics such as wool, silk and rough synthetics can be more irritating. Avoiding or removing triggers for your allergies also may help. Get advice and treatment for mild eczema to help prevent it from becoming a long-lasting condition (chronic eczema).\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of hyperkeratosis depends on the type and possible cause.\nDon't shave away or cut a corn or callus on your own. Consult a health professional for advice and treatment.\nIf the treatment does not reach the layer of skin infected with the virus, the wart can come back in the same place. Repeat treatments may be necessary.\nWarts can be treated at home with nonprescription remedies. Self-treatment will take longer for the wart to go away compared to treatment in a medical setting. Self-treatment may be more effective after you have been treated by a health care professional. This is especially true if a wart appears to be large or deep. If you have diabetes or poor circulation, it's best to be treated by a health care professional.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment to see a health care professional or podiatrist if:\nPeople with diabetes should have their feet examined regularly by a health professional to avoid skin infections from corns, calluses or warts.\nAdults should examine their skin regularly after age 20. This is particularly true for those who have a history of working or playing for long hours in the sun. If you are not sure how to examine your skin, ask your doctor for guidance.\nIf you think you have hyperkeratosis or eczema, schedule an appointment with a health care professional.\nWhenever you notice that a skin growth or mole has changed color, size or shape, call your doctor for a more urgent appointment. Any new mole or other growth should be checked for signs of cancer.\nIf you have actinic keratoses, call your doctor for treatment.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most forms of hyperkeratosis are local skin problems that have a good prognosis.\nActinic keratoses can develop into squamous cell skin cancer.\n",

      "What is it?": "Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which your body makes too much thyroid hormone. It is also called overactive thyroid. Thyroid hormones are made by the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located in the lower front of the neck. Thyroid hormones regulate the body's energy. When levels of thyroid hormones are unusually high, the body burns energy faster and many vital functions speed up.\nHyperthyroidism is usually caused by the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone. The three most common reasons for this are:\nRarely, the condition is caused by the pituitary gland making too much thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone.\nCertain types of thyroid inflammation (thyroiditis) can cause short-term hyperthyroidism. This can occur after childbirth or after viral infections, for example.\nIn very rare situations, excess thyroid hormone can come from a source outside the thyroid. For example, abnormal tissue growth in the ovary can secrete thyroid hormone.\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism also can be caused by taking excessive amounts of thyroid supplements.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:\nIn women, menstrual periods may become less frequent or stop completely. Older people may develop heart failure or chest pain.\nWhen Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism, you also may have swelling of tissues behind the eyes. This causes a characteristic protruding, staring appearance.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will examine you. He or she will feel your thyroid for signs of enlargement or abnormal lumps. He or she also may use a stethoscope to listen for increased blood flow into your thyroid gland.\nYour doctor will check for additional signs of hyperthyroidism. These include:\nIf your doctor suspects hyperthyroidism, he or she will order blood tests. These will check your levels of thyroid hormones.\nOther diagnostic tests may include:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Hyperthyroidism caused by certain types of inflammation or viral infections (thyroiditis) usually resolves after several months.\nMost people with Graves' disease require long-term treatment. The condition occasionally goes away on its own.\n",
      "Prevention": "Hyperthyroidism caused by taking too much thyroid medication can be prevented. Follow your doctor's instructions. Periodically get blood tests to check thyroid levels.\nNaturally occurring hyperthyroidism cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treatment": "Most people with hyperthyroidism require beta-blockers such as propranolol (Inderal) or nadolol. Beta blockers slow the heart rate and reduce the tremor. Beta blockers are used while more specific therapy takes effect.\nHyperthyroidism is often first treated with antithyroid drug therapy. This blocks the formation of thyroid hormones. The most commonly used drug is methimazole.\nRadioactive iodine destroys the thyroid. This is a more permanent option. It is used to treat hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease. It is also used to treat thyroid nodules producing too much thyroid hormone.\nAnother option is surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid gland. Today, surgery is done less often to treat hyperthyroidism.\nPatients treated with radioactive iodine or surgery almost always need lifelong thyroid hormone replacement pills.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism or your treatment is not helping your symptoms as much as you expected.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many people with Graves' disease who are treated with antithyroid drugs have prolonged remissions of their illness.\nRadioactive iodine also is an effective treatment for Graves' disease. It is almost always used in patients with overproducing thyroid nodules.\nMany people will develop an underactive thyroid following radioactive iodine treatment. This is called hypothyroidism. This condition is easily treated with daily thyroid replacement medication.\n",

      "What is it?": "Hypoglycemia is an abnormally low level of blood sugar (blood glucose). Hypoglycemia triggers the release of body hormones, such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which serve to raise the low sugar level. The release of these hormones causes the early symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor, sweating, rapid heartbeat, and anxiety. Because the brain depends on blood sugar as its primary source of energy, if untreated hypoglycemia may interfere with the brain's ability to function properly, resulting in blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, and even loss of consciousness and convulsions (seizures).\nHypoglycemia is most common in people with diabetes who are treated with specific medications. Hypoglycemia occurs because of too high a dose of insulin or one of the sulfonylureas (glyburide, glipizide and others), or a change in diet or exercise without adjusting glucose-lowering medications. Insulin and exercise both lower blood sugar and food with carbohydrate raises it.\nHypoglycemia can occur, although rarely, in people who do not have diabetes. When it does occur outside of diabetes, hypoglycemia can be caused by a variety of medical problems. A partial list includes:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Hypoglycemia can cause:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If a person with diabetes has severe hypoglycemia, he or she may not be able to answer the doctor's questions because of confusion or unconsciousness. In this case, a family member or close friend will need to describe the patient's medical history and insulin regimen.\nTo help ensure effective emergency treatment, all people with diabetes treated with insulin or a sulfonylurea should consider wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace. This potentially lifesaving jewelry will identify the patient as having diabetes, especially when the patient is far from home or traveling alone.\nFamily members or friends of a person with diabetes should learn how to bring a patient out of severe hypoglycemia by giving the person orange juice or another carbohydrate, or by giving an injection of the drug glucagon, which can raise blood sugar.\nIf a person with diabetes can answer questions appropriately, the doctor will want to know the names and doses of all medications, as well as recent food intake and exercise schedule. If the patient has been self-monitoring blood sugar with a glucometer (a hand-held device to measure glucose levels in blood from a finger prick) or with continuous glucose monitoring, the doctor will review the most recent blood sugar readings to confirm low blood sugar and to check for a pattern of hypoglycemia related to medication schedule, diet, or exercise.\nIn people who do not have diabetes, the doctor will review current medications and ask about any history of gastrointestinal surgery (especially involving the stomach), liver disease, and the circumstances surrounding the epsodes. Patients should describe their symptoms and when they occur — whether they occur before or after meals, during sleeping, or after exercise.\nIn a person with diabetes, the diagnosis of hypoglycemia is based on symptoms and blood sugar readings. In most cases, no further testing is necessary.\nIn a person who is not diabetic, the ideal time for diagnostic testing is during an episode of symptoms. At that time, blood can be drawn to measure levels of glucose, and the patient's reactions to glucose intake can be tested. If these measures confirm the diagnosis of hypoglycemia, blood can be sent to a laboratory to measure insulin levels.\nIn a person who is not diabetic, the ideal time for diagnostic testing is during an episode of symptoms. At that time, blood can be drawn to measure levels of glucose and insulin if an insulinoma is suspected. Other hormones, such as cortisol and thyroid levels, may also be measured. If the patient has no symptoms at the time of evaluation, the doctor may ask him or her to measure his or her blood glucose when hypoglycemic symptoms occur.\nIf an insulinoma is suspected, the doctor may order a supervised 48-hour fast. During that period, blood levels of glucose and insulin will be measured when symptoms occur. A blood glucose level of less than 60 milligrams per deciliter at the time of symptoms and with a measurable level of insulin strongly suggests the person has an insulinoma. Accidental use of insulin or another diabetic drug may also cause hypoglycemia.\nIf a person develops symptoms of hypoglycemia only after eating, the doctor may ask him or her to self-monitor blood sugar with a glucometer at the time the symptoms occur.\n",
      "Expected duration": "An episode of hypoglycemia in a patient treated with short-acting insulin and which is precipitated by exercise or by relatively too much insulin usually can be stopped within minutes by eating or drinking a food or beverage that contains sugar (sugar tablets, candy, orange juice, non-diet soda). Hypoglycemia caused by sulfonylurea or long-acting insulin can last longer and can even recur after initial treatment. In this circumstance, a longer-lasting carbohydrate (for example, bread or a muffin) should be eaten after the rapid carbohydrate.\nPeople with diabetes remain at risk for episodes of hypoglycemia throughout life because they need medications that lower blood sugar. Hypoglycemic episodes at night are particularly dangerous because the person often sleeps through part of the time that their blood sugar is low, treating the sugar level less quickly. Over time, repeated severe episodes, such as with loss of consciousness or seizures, can lead to impaired brain function.\nAbout 85% of patients with an insulinoma will be cured of hypoglycemia once the insulin-secreting tumor is removed.\nMany people without diabetes who have symptoms that seem like signs of low blood sugar do not truly have low sugar levels. Instead, the symptoms are caused by something other than low blood glucose, such as anxiety.\n",
      "Prevention": "In people taking insulin or sulfonylureas, delayed or smaller meals than usual or increased exercise can lead to hypoglycemia. Therefore, meal timing and size should be kept as consistent as possible. In addition, drinking alcohol can lead to an episode of hypoglycemia. Patients with diabetes should discuss with their doctors how much alcohol, if any, they can drink safely. Alcohol can cause serious episodes of hypoglycemia even when insulin was taken hours before. People with diabetes should be very aware of this possible problem if they drink.\nPeople with diabetes treated with insulin should always have ready access to a supply of rapidly absorbable sugar to treat unexpected episodes of hypoglycemia. Supplies may include candy, sugar tablets, and sugar paste in a tube. A glucagon kit should be kept at home.  Glucagon may be given by injection or nasally by a knowledgeable family member or friend if a hypoglycemic patient is unconscious and cannot safely take sugar by mouth. For diabetic children, emergency supplies can be kept in the school nurse's office.\nAny person at risk of hypoglycemic episodes can help to avoid delays in treating attacks by learning about his or her condition and sharing this knowledge with friends and family members. The risk for hypoglycemia is lower if you eat at regular times during the day, never skip meals, and maintain a consistent exercise level.\nLike people with diabetes, nondiabetic people with hypoglycemia should always have ready access to a source of sugar. In rare circumstances, a doctor may prescribe medications to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, and a glucagon emergency kit for nondiabetic people who have a history of becoming disoriented or losing consciousness from hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Treatment": "If a conscious person is having symptoms of hypoglycemia, the symptoms usually go away within 5-15 minutes if the person eats or drinks something sweet (3 sugar tablets, 4-5 Life Savers candies, or 4-6 ounces of juice or non-diet soda). An unconscious patient can be treated with an immediate injection of glucagon or with intravenous glucose infusions by EMTs or in a hospital.\nPeople with diabetes who have hypoglycemic episodes may need to adjust their medications, especially the insulin dose, and change their diet or their exercise habits.\nPeople with longstanding diabetes may stop experiencing the usual early warning symptoms (the tremors, sweating and fast heart rate) of hypoglycemia. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. It can be very serious because the person may not know to seek treatment.\nIf you and your doctor identify that you are unaware when you have low blood sugars, your dose of insulin or other diabetes medicines will probably need to be reduced. You will need to check your blood sugar more often, and continuous glucose monitors that alarm when blood sugars are low may be helpful. Your insulin dose will likely need frequent adjustments to maintain reasonable blood sugars with less risk of hypoglycemia.\nAn insulinoma is treated with surgery to remove the tumor. Hypoglycemia caused by problems with the adrenal or pituitary glands is treated by replacing the missing hormones with medication.\nNondiabetic people with hypoglycemic symptoms following meals are often treated by modifying their diet. They usually need to eat frequent, small meals and avoid fasting.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call for emergency medical assistance whenever anyone is unconscious or disoriented enough so that they cannot safely be treated with oral therapy. Severe insulin reactions can be fatal, so it is important to seek treatment immediately.\nPeople with diabetes should contact their doctors promptly if they experience frequent episodes of hypoglycemia. They may need to adjust their daily doses of medications, meal plans, and/or exercise program.\nNondiabetic people who experience symptoms of hypoglycemia should contact their doctors for evaluation of the problem.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In people with diabetes, the outlook is excellent if they follow their prescribed medication dosage, recommended diet, and exercise guidelines.\nMost patients with insulinomas can have them removed successfully by surgery. However, in a small percentage of these patients, the insulinoma cannot be completely removed. These patients may still suffer from hypoglycemia after surgery.\nMost patients with other forms of hypoglycemia can be treated successfully with changes in diet.\n",

      "What is hypoparathyroidism?": "Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder in which the body produces too little or no parathyroid hormone. This hormone, together with vitamin D and another hormone called calcitonin, regulates the amount of calcium in the blood. Hypoparathyroidism can result in an abnormally low level of calcium in the blood, called hypocalcemia.\nParathyroid hormone is produced by the parathyroid glands, four small glands located behind the thyroid gland in the neck.\n\nDoctors classify hypoparathyroidism as either hereditary or acquired. In hereditary hypoparathyroidism, the parathyroid glands are either absent at birth or fail to function properly for some unknown reason. Hereditary hypoparathyroidism sometimes occurs with other developmental defects, or as part of a syndrome that affects the thyroid gland and adrenal cortex. It generally causes symptoms before age 10, although occasionally symptoms will appear later.\nAcquired hypoparathyroidism most commonly occurs when the parathyroid glands are removed or damaged during surgery. This can occur during surgery on the thyroid gland to treat hyperthyroidism or a thyroid tumor or during surgery on the parathyroid glands themselves to treat an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism). The acquired hypoparathyroidism is most often temporary. Acquired hypoparathyroidism is less common than it once was because surgeons have recognized the importance of preserving the parathyroid glands during surgery and because nonsurgical treatments for hyperthyroidism have become more common.\n",
      "Symptoms of hypoparathyroidism": "The symptoms of hypoparathyroidism result from the low levels of calcium in the body. The most common symptom is muscle cramps or tightness and tingling of the lips or fingers. This condition is known as tetany, which causes twitching and painful spasms in muscles of the face, hands, arms, throat and sometimes the feet. Seizures also can occur, but they are rare.\nIn addition to tetany, symptoms accompanying hereditary hypoparathyroidism can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing hypoparathyroidism": "Your doctor will ask you about unexplained twitching or spasms of muscles, dry skin, hair loss, or yeast infections. In children, your doctor will ask about tooth development and about the timing of developmental milestones (ages at which your child first rolled over, sat up, crawled, walked, and spoke).\nIf you are experiencing symptoms, your doctor will look for muscle spasms, particularly in your face and hands. Your doctor also will check for signs of dry skin, areas of thin hair, and yeast infections. Your doctor will confirm a diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism with a blood test to measure your levels of parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphorus.\n",
      "Expected duration of hypoparathyroidism": "Hypoparathyroidism may be a chronic (long-lasting) condition that requires lifelong treatment with calcium and vitamin D supplements.\n",
      "Preventing hypoparathyroidism": "There is no cure for either hereditary or sustained acquired hypoparathyroidism. With vitamin D therapy and supplemental calcium, most people will have minimal symptoms, if any.\n",
      "Treating hypoparathyroidism": "Whether it is hereditary or acquired, hypoparathyroidism is treated with calcium and vitamin D supplements to maintain a normal level of calcium in the blood. Vitamin D is necessary because it helps your body to absorb calcium. The supplements may need to be taken for the rest of your life, and your blood must be tested regularly to ensure that proper levels of calcium and vitamin D are being maintained. Regular checkups are important. Episodes of tetany are treated with calcium given intravenously (into a vein), which provides quick relief of symptoms.\nMedications called diuretics sometimes are given to prevent too much calcium from being lost through the urine, a problem that can lead to kidney stones. Diuretics will reduce the amount of calcium and vitamin D supplements you need.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you or a family member has painful muscle spasms, particularly in the face, hands, arms, or feet; or a pins-and-needles feeling in the face, hands, or feet. Also call a doctor if a child has the following symptoms:\n",
      "Prognosis": "With appropriate treatment, people with hypoparathyroidism can expect to lead an almost normal life.\n",

      "What is hypothyroidism?": "Hypothyroidism means your thyroid gland cannot produce the normal amount of thyroid hormone. Your thyroid gland is under active. The thyroid gland is located in the lower, front of the neck.\nHypothyroidism is more common in women than men. Babies can be born with hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Symptoms of hypothyroidism": "In adults, hypothyroidism can cause the following symptoms:\nIf severe hypothyroidism is not treated, a cluster of symptoms called myxedema may appear. These symptoms include an expressionless face, thin hair, puffiness around the eyes, enlarged tongue, and thick skin that feels cool and doughy.\nIn babies born with hypothyroidism, there may be a hoarse cry, slow growth, unusual sleepiness, constipation and feeding problems. If hypothyroidism is not treated, the child may be unusually short and have dry skin, thin hair, an unusual facial appearance, a protruding abdomen, delayed eruption of teeth and problems with mental development. When hypothyroidism occurs in an older child, it may delay puberty and cause other symptoms similar to those seen in adults.\n",
      "Diagnosing hypothyroidism": "Your doctor will examine you and will inspect your thyroid gland, which may be enlarged. Your doctor also will check for characteristic signs of hypothyroidism, such as looking for dry skin, thinning hair, and a slow heart rate. Your doctor will check your knee and ankle reflexes to see if they respond more slowly than expected.\nYour doctor will diagnose hypothyroidism based on the results of blood tests for levels of thyroid hormones and serum TSH. The TSH test is the most sensitive test for hypothyroidism caused by problem with the thyroid gland. Your doctor also may order blood tests for cholesterol and other blood components, which are often abnormal in people with hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Expected duration of hypothyroidism": "In people with short-term hypothyroidism caused by certain types of thyroid inflammation or viral thyroid infections, levels of thyroid hormones often return to normal after several months. In other people with hypothyroidism, the disorder is a lifelong problem.\n",
      "Preventing hypothyroidism": "The thyroid needs iodine (in tiny amounts) to make thyroid hormone. Today, so many foods contain iodine that hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency has become extremely rare. However, ingesting extra iodine does not prevent hypothyroidism. So in reality, there is no way to prevent hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Treating hypothyroidism": "Hypothyroidism is treated with replacement doses of thyroid hormones. Most people with hypothyroidism take a synthetic form of the hormone, known as levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl and other brand names). Some people will instead take liothyronine (Cytomel), either alone or in combination with levothyroxine.\nAnyone taking thyroid medication has to have a blood test periodically to make sure the dose he or she is taking is maintaining the right levels of thyroid hormones in the body. It is especially important for people with hypothyroidism to be monitored during pregnancy, because the need for thyroid hormone may go up. Also some foods and medications can lower the amount of active thyroid hormone available to the body's cells. For example, iron can interfere with the absorption of thyroid medication inside the intestine, and oral estrogen tends to make more circulating thyroid bind to proteins in the blood, so less free thyroid hormone is available to the body's cells.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have the symptoms of hypothyroidism, especially if you constantly feel tired, notice that you are losing hair, and develop an abnormal sensitivity to cold. If your infant or child has symptoms of hypothyroidism, call your pediatrician immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In adults, treatment with thyroid hormones usually relieves symptoms of hypothyroidism within weeks, although it can take months. However, in some elderly patients, dosages may need to be increased very slowly over six to eight weeks to prevent strain on the heart. In infants and children with hypothyroidism, immediate and consistent treatment with thyroid hormones usually can prevent problems with growth or intellectual development.\n",

      "What is ichthyosis?": "Ichthyosis is the term for severe, persistent problems with dry skin that almost always start in childhood or infancy. Ichthyosis can be genetic (inherited) or can develop later in life. In a large majority of people with the disease, the cause is related to one or more genetic mutations.\nUnder normal circumstances, the body continuously renews its skin surface, building new skin cells and allowing older cells to be shed from the surface. Ichthyosis disrupts this balance, either because too many replacement skin cells are produced or because the skin cells do not separate well from the skin surface when it is their time to drop off. The result is that skin cells accumulate into thick flakes that adhere to the body and can resemble fish scales.\nIchthyosis often causes severe cosmetic concerns for the person with the condition. However, it is not a contagious disease. The condition also can interfere with the skin's critical roles in protecting against infection, preventing dehydration, and regulating body temperature.\nMost people with ichthyosis have ichthyosis vulgaris, the mildest form of the disease. It occurs in one out of every 250 people.\n",
      "Symptoms of ichthyosis": "Depending on the type of gene abnormality that causes ichthyosis, the skin can show different patterns of flaking. In most cases of ichthyosis vulgaris, for example, skin will flake over the majority of the body, but not on the inside surfaces of joints, in the groin area, or on the face.\nSymptoms of all genetic types of ichthyosis are either noticeable at birth or appear during childhood. Symptoms may include:\nCertain genetic conditions affect other parts of the body besides the skin, including nerve damage, deafness, or loss of the sense of smell. Adults may develop ichthyosis due to certain cancers such as lymphoma.\nSkin dryness is usually worse in winter months and in dry climates, because warmth and humidity improve these symptoms. Many people who have ichthyosis vulgaris also have allergic problems such as allergic nasal congestion, asthma, or eczema.\n",
      "Diagnosing ichthyosis": "A doctor usually can diagnose ichthyosis by looking at the skin. A family history is also very useful. In some cases, a skin biopsy will be done to help to confirm the diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed and examined under a microscope. In rare instances, genetic testing may be helpful in making a diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration of ichthyosis": "Most cases of ichthyosis have a genetic basis and wills last a lifetime. Sometimes, adult onset ichthyosis occurs in association with a disease, and if the disease can be treated, the ichthyosis may go away. In most people, symptoms can be controlled.\n",
      "Preventing ichthyosis": "There is no way to prevent ichthyosis. As with other genetic diseases, there is a risk that children of an affected parent will inherit the gene.\n",
      "Treating ichthyosis": "Treatment of all types of ichthyosis involves restoring the skin's moisture and facilitating more aggressive shedding of dead skin cells. Regular visits to a dermatologist can help when ichthyosis causes severe symptoms.\nTo get the best results, use moisture-retaining creams or ointments after a bath or shower, so that moisture is maintained within the skin surface. Petrolatum, lanolin, or urea-containing preparations are very helpful in maintaining skin moisture.\nAlso helpful are medicines that promote shedding of skin flakes. These include lotions or creams that contain lactic acid or other alpha-hydroxy acids.\nIf the ichthyosis leads to scratching that causes skin infections, or if body odor is a major problem, antibiotics may be needed from time to time.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Because ichthyosis can make the skin a less effective barrier to infection, it is important to contact a physician if you develop a fever or redness of the skin.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With continued effective treatment and good advice about skin care, ichthyosis is usually very manageable. Some forms of ichthyosis improve after childhood. Rare forms of ichthyosis can be life-threatening, even in infancy, if skin problems are severe or if the condition is associated with serious disease in other parts of the body.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Illness anxiety disorder is a persistent fear of having a grave medical illness. A person with this disorder pays excessive attention to health. He or she can become easily alarmed by anything that might be interpreted as a sign of illness, including normal sensations, bodily functions and mild symptoms. For them, such experiences may signal an illness with a grim outcome. For example, a person may fear that the normal sounds of digestion, sweating or a mark on the skin may be indicators of life-threatening disease.\nTo continue reading this article, you mustlog in.\nSubscribe to Harvard Health Online for immediate access to health news and information from Harvard Medical School.\nI'd like to receive access to Harvard Health Online for only $4.99 a month.\nAlready a member?Login ».\n",

      "What is ITP?": "Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) can be understood by looking at the three terms that make up its name:\nIn short, ITP is an illness in which unusually low levels of platelets lead to purpura and other forms of abnormal bleeding.\nIn people with ITP, the immune system produces abnormal proteins called antiplatelet antibodies. These misdirected proteins attach themselves to the surface of blood platelets as if the platelets were \"foreign\" or invading bacteria or viruses. As the affected platelets circulate in the bloodstream, they are recognized as abnormal by the spleen and removed from the blood.\nAs more and more platelets are removed by the spleen, the level of platelets in the blood drops past the lower limit of normal (about 130,000 per cubic millimeter of blood) and the patient is diagnosed with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).\nWhen platelet levels fall into the 30,000 to 50,000 range, a person may begin to have abnormal bleeding after a minor skin injury such as a small cut, bruise, medical injection, blood test, or tooth extraction.\nIf platelet levels fall below 10,000, the person has an increased risk of bleeding even when no injury has occurred. This type of bleeding is especially dangerous if it happens inside the skull and brain, where it is known as an intracranial hemorrhage. Bleeding may also occur in the kidneys and bladder, causing bloody urine. Excessive bleeding can also occur during menstrual cycles.\nThere are currently three classifications of ITP:\nIn most cases, the cause of ITP is unknown. In a few cases, ITP can be a reaction to a specific drug or food ingredient, such as quinine in tonic water. Rarely, ITP has been reported following vaccination, including for COVID-19. In the United States, ITP is a relatively rare illness that affects about four out of every 100,000 people each year.\nITP can occur during pregnancy. The low platelets can lead to serious bleeding problems both in the mother and fetus.\n",
      "Symptoms of ITP": "ITP does not usually cause symptoms as long as your platelet count remains above 50,000, which is typically the minimum needed to prevent abnormal bleeding.\nSometimes, the only symptom is the appearance of tiny purplish spots that show up on the lower legs. They are called petechiae. These are pinpoint size accumulations of blood under the skin caused by leaky small blood vessels.\nAt very low platelet levels, ITP can cause different symptoms, depending on the type of ITP.\n",
      "Diagnosing ITP": "It's important that you tell your doctor about all prescription and nonprescription drugs and natural or herbal remedies that you or your child is taking. Your doctor will examine you or your child with special attention to any rashes, areas of bruising, oozing cuts or other signs of abnormal bleeding. Your doctor will order one or more of the following tests:\nDepending on the results of these tests, a bone marrow biopsy may be recommended. In a bone marrow biopsy, a small piece of bone marrow is removed and examined in a laboratory. This test is not routinely necessary to diagnose ITP, but it may be recommended if other conditions are under consideration (such as leukemia) or if standard treatments for ITP have not been effective.\n",
      "Expected duration of ITP": "Newly diagnosed (acute ITP) lasts for three months or less; in children with acute ITP, about 75% recover on their own within two to three months. Persistent and chronic ITP tends to come and go over many years.\n",
      "Preventing ITP": "In most cases, there is no way to prevent ITP. If a medication has caused the condition, stopping the medication may cure the condition; avoiding this medication in the future may prevent recurrence.\n",
      "Treating ITP": "Treatment varies, depending on whether ITP is acute, persistent or chronic:\nIf these other treatments aren't effective, danazol (Cyclomen, others), dapsone (generic), or other immune-suppressing medications (such as mycophenolate mofetil/Cellcept or azathioprine/Imuran) may be recommended. Combinations of these treatments may be effective when individual treatments are not.\nPatients who have undergone spleen removal need to be aware that they are at significant increased risk for the development of certain types of infections, and should receive a number of vaccinations.\nAll medications, foods, and beverages should be reviewed to be certain that they do not contain an ingredient that may have triggered the ITP. For example, in certain people, ingesting quinine (as in tonic water) can cause a low platelet count.\nDuring treatment for ITP, you or your child will be advised to avoid sports and other physical activities that have a high risk of injury, especially head injury.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have had episodes of abnormal bleeding, including easy bruising, prolonged oozing from small cuts, abnormal menstrual bleeding, or prolonged bleeding after minor surgery or dental procedures.\nIf you are a parent, call your pediatrician or family doctor if your child develops signs of abnormal bleeding such as easy bruising, a red or purple rash, lots of tiny purple spots (petechiae), frequent or heavy nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood blisters inside the mouth or lips.\n",
      "Prognosis": "For children, the outlook for acute ITP is generally good. About 75% of patients recover completely within three months, and about 80% recover within six months. Less than 1% of children with ITP develop bleeding within the skull. Only a small percentage of children go on to develop chronic ITP, and most of these children do not have serious bleeding.\nIn adults with chronic ITP, symptoms may come and go. When medication is necessary, about 50% of patients who are treated with prednisone have normal platelet counts within four to six weeks. However, when the prednisone is reduced, the platelet count may drop again. If this happens, doctors may recommend that the person's spleen be removed. Within one week of having the spleen removed, about 70% of adult patients with chronic ITP have normal platelet counts. One risk of removing the spleen is an increased risk of infections.\n",

      "What is it?": "Impetigo is a contagious bacterial skin infection, usually caused by Group A streptococcus orStaphylococcus aureusbacteria. Impetigo is most common in children. However, it sometimes occurs in adults who have other itchy skin conditions, such as eczema. Other conditions that increase your risk of developing impetigo include chickenpox, reactions to insect bites, burns of the skin and diabetes.\nImpetigo often appears around the nose and mouth. However, it can develop wherever the skin is broken by cuts, scrapes, scratching, or cold sores,andwhere bacteria can enter.\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "Impetigo causes small bumps or blisters that burst. The skin underneath is moist, tender and red, and it oozes a clear liquid. A honey-colored crust, which may itch, then forms over the reddened area. If the disease is more severe, you also may have a fever and swelling of the lymph glands (swollen glands) in the face or neck.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A doctor can diagnose impetigo by looking at your skin. In rare cases, your doctor may swab the skin to obtain tissue and fluid that can be tested in a laboratory to identify the bacteria that caused the infection.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once treatment is started, healing should begin within several days, and the infection should be gone in about a week or two.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent impetigo, take a bath or shower every day, and always keep your skin clean. If you have cuts or scrapes in your skin, or a poison ivy rash, make sure to keep the area clean and avoid scratching.\nIf you have impetigo, you can prevent spreading the infection by not touching the affected area. You can easily spread the infection from one place on your body to another if you touch the infection then touch somewhere else. To keep impetigo from spreading, it is very important that pillowcases and sheets be washed every day. Personal items, such as soap and towels, should be kept separate from other family members. Playmates who come in contact with infected skin can develop impetigo, so children who have impetigo should try to avoid contact with others until it clears up.\n",
      "Treatment": "Impetigo usually is treated with antibiotics, either in the form of liquid, pills, or an injection. For localized areas of impetigo, your doctor may prescribe a topical antibacterial skin ointment such as mupirocin (Bactroban) or retapamulin (Altabax). The area around the blisters should be washed with soap and water, and any moist, yellow scabs can be gently cleansed with a hydrogen peroxide diluted with water. Covering the area with gauze and tape or a loose plastic bandage can help to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to other parts of the body.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you think you or your child might have impetigo, contact a doctor, especially if either of you has been exposed to someone else with the condition. If impetigo is not treated, it can spread rapidly.\nIf you or your child is being treated for impetigo, contact the doctor if a fever develops or if an area becomes enlarged or red.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Impetigo should heal without scarring, as long as the child doesn't pick the bumps and blisters. Infants are more likely to develop complications of impetigo, such as inflammation of the kidneys (glomerulonephritis) and infection of the blood (bacteremia).\n",

      "What is erectile dysfunction?": "Impotence means that a man's penis doesn't get hard enough to have sexual intercourse. The man cannot get or maintain an erection. The medical term is erectile dysfunction (ED).\nED is not the same as premature ejaculation.\nThe major causes of ED include:\n",
      "Symptoms of erectile dysfunction": "A man with impotence has either a problem getting an erection or difficulty maintaining one. This usually interferes with sexual activity.\nImpotence can happen suddenly or gradually. Some men slowly lose the firmness of their erections or how long the erections last.\nIn other men, especially those whose impotence is largely caused by psychological factors, the problem may occur unpredictably. It can improve at any time.\nMen with impotence may continue to have normal orgasm and ejaculation without a full erection.\n",
      "Diagnosing erectile dysfunction": "Your doctor will ask you about your medical history. He or she will want to learn if any medical conditions might be causing the impotence. These may include vascular, neurological, and hormonal disorders.\nVascular disorders affect the entire body. Many men who have impotence because of vascular disease also have a history of heart disease, stroke, or poor circulation in their legs.\nNeurological problems can contribute to impotence in men with a history of diabetes and spinal cord injury. They also can cause symptoms in other parts of the body.\nIn men with abnormal hormone levels, a reduced sex drive often accompanies impotence.\nYour doctor will review the medications you take. These include over-the-counter products and herbal remedies.\nYour doctor will ask about your sex life. He or she will ask about the quality of your sexual relationships.\nYour doctor will examine you to look for evidence of medical problems. This will include an examination of your penis and testes. Your blood may be tested for blood sugar, cholesterol, and levels of certain hormones.\nOccasionally, a doctor may order additional tests. One such test is a nocturnal penile tumescence study. This is a way to determine how often you get erections while you sleep.\nAnother test that may be done is a Doppler ultrasound of the blood vessels in the penis. This test measures how well the blood is flowing in your penis.\nYour doctor may not be able to give you a specific reason why you have impotence. But many of the treatments work well no matter what caused the problem. So extensive testing may not be necessary.\n",
      "Expected duration of erectile dysfunction": "How long your impotence lasts depends upon what causes it and how quickly your treatment starts to work. Impotence is treatable in all age groups.\n",
      "Preventing erectile dysfunction": "You can decrease your risk of developing erectile dysfunction by making lifestyle choices that help keep your blood vessels healthy and help prevent type 2 diabetes.\nThe following steps may help:\nBecause certain medications have been associated with impotence, ask your doctor about possible side before you start a new prescription.\n",
      "Treating erectile dysfunction": "There are many effective treatments for impotence. The most popular is a class of drugs called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. These include sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil (Cialis), and avanafil (Stendra). These drugs are taken in pill form. They work in most men. But they are less effective in men with neurological causes of impotence.\nThe PDE5 drugs are generally safe. But always review the risks with your doctor. PDE5 drugs can interact with other medications and cause dangerously low blood pressure. For example, you should not take PDE5 drugs if you use nitroglycerin or other nitrate medications.\nThe most worrisome side effects are sudden onset of vision or hearing loss. This occurs very rarely but requires immediate medical attention. PDE5 drugs can cause other side effects, such as flushing and headache.\nIf PDE5 drugs don't work or cannot be used because of potential side effects, your doctor can recommend other therapies. The drug alprostadil (Caverject, Edex, Muse) allows blood to flow more freely in the penis, leading to an erection. The drug can be injected with a tiny needle into your penis. Or, a small pellet (suppository) can be inserted into the opening of the penis. Suppositories and injections are effective in the majority of men.\nTaking extra testosterone will not improve ED. For men who have abnormally low levels of the hormone, testosterone replacement may enhance sexual desire.\nPsychological therapy can be effective in men whose impotence is caused primarily by psychological factors. This might include counseling, behavioral therapy, or couples' therapy.\nMen who do not benefit from medical or psychological treatment often have success with mechanical or prosthetic devices. External products, known as vacuum erection devices, are safe and highly effective. But many men and their partners find them unappealing.\nAnother option is a surgically placed penile implant. Only a small number of men with impotence choose this option.\nVascular (blood vessel) surgery sometimes is recommended for young, healthy men who develop impotence after trauma to the groin.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Speak to your doctor if you have trouble getting or keeping an erection over three months or more.\nImpotence caused by psychological factors may get better on its own. But treatment is needed if the problem is caused by a physical factor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In general, the outlook for most men with erectile dysfunction is positive.\n",

      "What is it?": "Infectious arthritis is joint pain, soreness, stiffness, and swelling caused by an infectious agent such as bacteria, viruses or fungi.\nThese infections can enter a joint various ways:\nOnce the infection reaches the joint, it can cause symptoms of joint inflammation that is often accompanied by joint swelling, fever, and chills. Depending on the type of infection, one or more joints may be affected.\nThe most common joint affected by bacterial infection is the knee. Small joints, such as those in fingers and toes, are more likely to become infected after a viral infection or after direct injury, such as a bite. In people who use intravenous drugs, joints in the spine or breastbone (sternum) may be involved. People who already have rheumatoid arthritis or another joint disease are more likely to develop infectious arthritis.\nCertain bacteria can cause a form of infectious arthritis called reactive arthritis, which appears to be caused by the immune system reacting to bacteria, rather than by the infection itself. In reactive arthritis, joint inflammation develops weeks or months after the infection. Reactive arthritis happens most commonly after infections of the genital and gastrointestinal tracts.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of infectious arthritis include:\nOther symptoms vary, depending on the cause. Some more common causes of infectious arthritis include:\n",
      "Lyme disease": "Lyme disease is caused by bacteria that live in deer ticks and are transmitted through a tick bite into a person's bloodstream.\nBecause the tick bite often goes unnoticed and the rash may be overlooked, Lyme disease is not always diagnosed immediately. When the infection is not treated, further symptoms may develop, including joint inflammation (most commonly in the knee). Arthritis typically develops in the later stages of Lyme disease.\n",
      "Gonorrhea": "Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection that can cause pain in one or more joints or tendons and sometimes a rash and fever. About one-third of people with gonorrhea report joint pain.\n",
      "Staphylococcus infection": "Staphylococcus bacteria are common bacteria that can cause infections through cuts or other breaks in the skin, or through contaminated food. The bacteria can be released in the bloodstream and spread to the knee or other joints, causing intense and sudden pain, swelling and immobility of the joint. This is a serious condition because joint damage can develop within days if the infection is not found and treated quickly.\n",
      "Tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. It usually affects the lungs, but it can affect other parts of the body, including the gastrointestinal tract, nerves, lymph system and skin, as well as bones and joints. Arthritis caused by tuberculosis usually affects either the spine or large joints, such as the hips or knees. The joint inflammation caused by tuberculosis tends to be less dramatic than inflammation caused by some other bacterial infections, and it develops slowly.\n",
      "Viruses": "Arthritis can be caused from infection by many viruses, including those that cause colds, upper respiratory infections, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, parvovirus, rubella and mumps. Many joints can be affected at the same time, and the symptoms of viral infectious arthritis can be similar to the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. However, viral arthritis symptoms usually disappear within days or weeks if the disease causing the problem goes away. HIV and some forms of viral hepatitis may cause chronic (long-lasting) infection and longer-lasting joint symptoms.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If your doctor suspects that your joint symptoms are related to a bacterial infection, he or she probably will remove fluid from the affected joint with a needle and will have it analyzed in a lab. You may have blood and urine tests. If your doctor thinks a sexually transmitted disease may be causing the problem, he or she will recommend testing with a vaginal or cervical swab or urine testing if you are a woman, and a swab of the penis or a urine test if you are a man. The urine and swabbed material are sent to be tested in a laboratory. Tests are not available to diagnose most viral diseases. However, some of the more common viral causes of arthritis, such as parvovirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, can usually be diagnosed with blood tests.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long symptoms last depends on the cause and how soon treatment is started. Symptoms can improve as soon as 24 hours after treatment starts. However, they may continue for weeks or months when related to Lyme disease, many bacterial strains or tuberculosis. If infection damages joints, symptoms may last a lifetime.\n",
      "Prevention": "The best way to prevent infectious arthritis varies depending on the type of infection:\n",
      "Treatment": "Because many bacterial infections can quickly and permanently destroy cartilage around joints, a joint infected with bacteria needs to be treated immediately with antibiotics.\nIf you have a bacterial infection, you probably will be hospitalized so the infected joint can be drained, you can receive antibiotics intravenously (into a vein) and you can rest the joint.\nIn some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged tissue from the joint. If serious damage already has occurred, surgery may be needed to reconstruct the joint. Surgery is rarely necessary for arthritis associated with gonorrhea or viral infection.\nViral infections do not respond to antibiotics and most will go away on their own. However, antiviral therapies are available for some viral infections, such as hepatitis C and HIV. Aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and other brand names) can be taken to alleviate pain and swelling during the time it takes for the infection to go away. Viral infections usually do not cause joint damage.\nReactive arthritis may be treated with other medicines, but only after the infection has been cured. These medicines include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, methotrexate (Folex, Methotrexate LPF, Rheumatrex) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine).\nWhile the joint is recovering from the infection, it may need to be immobilized briefly with a brace or splint. As soon as possible, however, exercise and physical therapy are recommended to restore strength and mobility.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience any of the symptoms of infectious arthritis for more than a few days, contact your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If infectious arthritis is detected and treated promptly, joint damage is unlikely. However, joint damage is possible with many types of infections, especially when a bacterial infection is not diagnosed and treated promptly.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Infectious mononucleosis is an illness caused by a viral infection. It is commonly called mononucleosis, or \"mono.\" Mononucleosis is most often caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. In some cases, it is caused by other viruses.\nMononucleosis has been nicknamed the \"kissing disease.\" This is because Epstein-Barr virus commonly is transmitted during kissing. However, sneezes and coughs also can transmit the virus.\nOnce a person is infected with Epstein-Barr virus, the virus remains in that person's body for the rest of his life. Mononucleosis typically occurs when a person first is infected with Epstein-Barr virus. But infection with Epstein-Barr virus does not always cause mononucleosis. It often causes only a mild illness or no illness at all.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The first symptoms of mononucleosis typically include:\nFever\nHeadaches\nMuscle aches\nUnusual fatigue, such as the need for 12 to 16 hours of sleep daily\nThese symptoms are followed very shortly by:\nSore throat\nEnlarged lymph nodes\nChills\nJoint aches\nLoss of appetite and slight weight loss\nNausea and vomiting (occasionally)\nA red rash, usually on the chest. This is more likely if the person has recently taken the antibiotics ampicillin or amoxicillin.\nAbdominal pain\nEnlarged spleen\nRare symptoms include:\nJaundice (yellow skin and eyes)\nDifficulty breathing\nAnemia\nIrregular heart rhythms\nIn rare cases, an enlarged spleen can rupture. The spleen is a small organ near the stomach. Untreated, a ruptured spleen can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about your medical history and current symptoms. He or she will want to know about recent exposure to anyone with mononucleosis or mono-like symptoms.\nDuring a physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of mononucleosis. These include:\nFever\nA reddened throat with enlarged tonsils\nSwollen lymph nodes in the neck and elsewhere\nAn enlarged spleen\nA red rash, usually on the chest\nYour doctor also will do blood tests to help make the diagnosis. The results of these blood tests may not be abnormal until the person has been ill for a week.\nTwo types of blood tests help to make the diagnosis:\nDifferential white blood cell count.This test measures levels of different types of white blood cells. In the first few weeks of mononucleosis, the number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) is quite high. There also are large numbers of lymphocytes that look unusual, called \"atypical lymphocytes\".\nHeterophil tests.Mononucleosis causes white blood cells to make an unusual kind of antibody called heterophil antibody. Heterophil tests measure levels of heterophil antibody. One of the most commonly used heterophil tests is the Monospot test.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Symptoms usually are most intense during the first two to four weeks of the illness. But some symptoms, especially fatigue, can last for several months or longer.\n",
      "Prevention": "This disease is most contagious during its acute stage. This is when the affected person still has a fever.\nSomeone with mononucleosis does not need to be kept isolated from others. However, many doctors recommend that the patient avoid kissing others while he or she is feeling ill. This helps to help prevent the spread of the infection.\nSome authorities also advise avoiding sharing food, drinks or eating utensils during the first few weeks of the illness.\n",
      "Treatment": "There is no medical cure for mononucleosis. It usually goes away on its own.\nMost treatment focuses on making the person more comfortable. Recovery usually calls for getting plenty of rest and fluids and treating symptoms.\nCold drinks, frozen desserts and gargling with salt water can help to relieve minor sore throat pain.\nIbuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be taken to fight fever and body aches.\nPrednisone can shrink tonsils when they have become so swollen that it is hard to breathe.\nIt is important to protect the spleen from rupture. Avoid strenuous activities, especially contact sports, for at least four weeks, and until your doctor finds that your spleen no longer is enlarged.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call your doctor if you develop the symptoms of mononucleosis.\nIf you have been diagnosed with mononucleosis, contact your doctor immediately if:\nYour breathing becomes difficult or noisy\nYou experience intense pain in the upper left side of your abdomen\nYour symptoms seem to be getting worse after one to two weeks\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most patients with mononucleosis recover completely. Some people with the illness develop strep throat. This is a bacterial infection that needs to be treated with antibiotics.\n",

      "What is an ingrown toenail?": "An ingrown toenail is a toenail with an edge that pushes into the skin and soft tissue at the side of the nail. This causes redness, swelling, and pain and can lead to infection. Symptoms can be worse when you are wearing a shoe, which puts pressure on the nail. The nail on the big toe becomes ingrown more often than other toenails.\nIngrown toenails can be caused by cutting toenails improperly, by wearing shoes that fit poorly, or by injuring the nail bed. Ingrown toenails also can run in the family.\n",
      "Symptoms of ingrown toenail": "The most common symptom of an ingrown toenail is pain, especially if the area becomes infected. The surrounding skin might be deep pink and release a discharge or pus, or it might appear raw with a red moist lump overlapping the nail edge.\n",
      "Diagnosing ingrown toenail": "Your doctor can diagnose an ingrown toenail by examining the area.\n",
      "Expected duration of ingrown toenail": "Ingrown toenails sometimes correct themselves as they grow out, but more advanced cases may need to be corrected with surgery.\n",
      "Preventing ingrown toenail": "You can do several things to prevent ingrown toenails from forming:\nIf you are elderly, have diabetes, or have other conditions that affect your circulation, be especially careful about how you cut your toenails and manage your foot health.\n",
      "Treating ingrown toenail": "In the early stages of an ingrown toenail, soak your foot in warm water containing antibacterial soap or a few tablespoons of salt. Dry your foot and apply an over-the-counter hydrocortisone or antibiotic ointment and a clean dressing for one to two weeks. Do not cut your nail. As much as possible, wear open-toed or loose-fitting shoes. When the nail grows out, cut it straight across. If you are not making any progress, your doctor can prescribe a stronger prescription-strength corticosteroid ointment to apply to the nail fold.\nIf the nail is not deeply ingrown, the edge of the nail can be lifted from the skin edge that it is irritating. There are multiple ways to help stop the nail from growing into the nail fold. For example, you can use dental floss to lift the corner of the nail and place cotton (or strands of dental floss) under the nail to keep the corner from putting pressure on the skin as it grows out.\nMore advanced ingrown toenails require the attention of a health care professional. If infection is present, your doctor may cut open infected areas with a blade or a needle to allow the pus to drain. Your doctor may numb your toe with local anesthetic and then remove a vertical strip of nail from the affected side of your toe. After this piece of nail is removed, the nail has a chance to regrow without an ingrown edge.\nIf you continue to get an ingrown toenail, your doctor might also treat the cuticle with a medicine called phenol. Phenol will prevent that area of your cuticle from producing new nail, so your toenail will be narrower than it was previously.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor or foot care specialist if ingrown nail symptoms do not go away on their own in a reasonable period, if you are in pain, or if you notice an infection. If you have diabetes or another health problem that affects your circulation, contact your doctor for treatment of your ingrown nail even if your symptoms are mild.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Once you learn the proper technique for cutting your nails, you may never have another ingrown toenail. If you need to have a vertical strip of your toenail removed, this side of your nail will take several months to replace itself. Usually, the new nail will not be an ingrown nail.\n",

      "What is an inguinal hernia?": "When part of an organ protrudes through an abnormal opening or in an abnormal way, this is called a hernia. A groin (inguinal) hernia occurs when part of the intestine bulges through a weak spot in the abdominal wall at the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is a passageway through the abdominal wall near the groin. Inguinal hernias are up to 10 times more common in men than in women. About one in four men develops a hernia at some point in life.\nThere are two types of inguinal hernias:\nIn adults, direct and indirect inguinal hernias look and feel about the same. They can occur on one or both sides of the groin. Your doctor may not know which type of hernia you have until surgery is performed. However, both types of hernias are treated in a similar manner.\nA type of hernia called a femoral hernia can appear similar to an inguinal hernia. Femoral hernias are much more common in women than in men. They may cause a lump that appears just below the groin and extends into the upper portion of the thigh. In a femoral hernia, a portion of the intestine protrudes through the passage that is normally used by large blood vessels (the femoral artery and vein) when they pass between the abdomen and the leg. Femoral hernias are most common in older, overweight women.\n",
      "Symptoms of inguinal hernia": "At first, an inguinal hernia either may not cause any symptoms or may cause only a feeling of heaviness or pressure in the groin. Symptoms are most likely to appear after standing for long periods, or when you engage in activities that increase pressure inside the abdomen, such as heavy lifting, persistent coughing or straining, while urinating, or moving the bowels.\nAs the hernia grows, it eventually causes an abnormal bulge under the skin near the groin. This bulge may become increasingly more uncomfortable or tender to the touch. As the hernia increases in size, a portion of herniated intestine may become trapped and unable to slide back into the abdomen. If this happens, there is a danger that the trapped intestine may twist and die because its blood supply is cut off. This causes severe pain and requires immediate treatment.\n",
      "Diagnosing inguinal hernia": "Your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. He or she will ask you when you first noticed the lump in your groin, whether it has become larger, and whether it hurts.\nDoctors can diagnose most inguinal hernias by examining the area. Your doctor will look for an abnormal protrusion near your groin and will feel the area to check for a mass. Often, the protruding hernia can be pushed back temporarily into the abdomen with careful pressure. Your doctor may ask you to cough or strain, which may make the hernia easier to feel or see.\nIn some cases, your doctor may need to confirm the diagnosis with an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan. In these procedures, painless sound waves or x-rays can distinguish a hernia from other causes of a mass in the groin area, such as an enlarged lymph node (swollen gland).\n",
      "Expected duration of inguinal hernia": "An inguinal hernia will not heal on its own. It is likely to become larger and cause increased discomfort until it is repaired. Hernias that are not repaired can cause bowel obstruction or strangulation, which is when part of the intestine dies because its blood supply is cut off.\n",
      "Preventing inguinal hernia": "Indirect hernias in children cannot be prevented. To reduce the risk of inguinal hernia as an adult, you can:\n",
      "Treating inguinal hernia": "Not all hernias need to be treated. However, most hernias that cause symptoms or that become even a little larger should be repaired by a surgeon. While awaiting surgery, some people wear a device called a truss, which puts pressure on the hernia and may help relieve discomfort temporarily. Except in very rare cases, the truss should not be considered a long-term solution.\nThere are two basic types of hernia repair: open surgery or laparoscopic surgery. Both usually are done on an outpatient basis and take about one hour to complete.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if you develop a lump, tenderness, or a persistent feeling of heaviness in your groin area. In babies and young children, call your doctor promptly if you notice a lump in the child's groin or scrotum.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Hernia surgery is very safe and usually quite effective. Depending on the location and size of the hernia and what technique is used, up to 10% of hernias may develop again at some point in the future.\nAfter open surgery, the person can usually resume normal activities within one to two weeks. For laparoscopic surgery, full recovery generally takes one week or less. After any hernia surgery, the person should avoid heavy lifting for six to eight weeks (or as long as the doctor directs) to allow muscle and tissues to heal completely.\n",

      "What is insomnia?": "Insomnia is difficulty getting enough sleep or trouble sleeping without interruption. You may have difficulty falling asleep, may wake up too early, or may wake up periodically during the night. Insomnia of any kind can keep you from feeling rested and refreshed during the day.\nAlmost all of us have episodes of insomnia at some time, but insomnia is not a short-term problem for everyone. Insomnia is classified aschronicwhen it happens almost every night for at least one month. Insomnia can be related to a medical or psychiatric illness, can be caused by mental stress or excitement, or can be caused by your daytime and bedtime habits.\nYour habits and surroundings are the usual causes of short-term insomnia problems. Factors that contribute to insomnia can include:\nPregnant women are particularly vulnerable to insomnia. Women who are pregnant may have insomnia because of hormone changes, heartburn, leg cramps or a need to urinate more frequently. In addition, the unborn baby's increasing size often makes it harder for the mother to find a comfortable sleeping position.\nChronic insomnia may be caused by a medical or psychiatric problem. Some common causes of chronic insomnia include:\nSleep apnea is a common condition. However, often the people that have this problem don't realize it. Snorers or people who are overweight may have repeated episodes in which breathing stops for 10 seconds to 30 seconds during sleep, just when the person is relaxing into deep sleep.\nSleep apnea is caused most often by relaxing the tongue and throat tissues, which can settle into a position that closes your airway. Your body reacts to sleep apnea by releasing adrenaline-like \"alarm\" hormones so you will awaken and resume breathing. These hormones keep you awake for periods of the night.\n",
      "Symptoms of insomnia": "Symptoms of insomnia can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing insomnia": "Your doctor often can determine the cause of your insomnia by asking about your habits and sleep environment, by reviewing your symptoms, and by examining you. Your doctor may suggest that you keep a sleep diary (a log of your sleep patterns) to provide an exact record of how many hours you sleep, whether symptoms may be your trigger for awakenings, and at what times you wake up.\nIf your doctor suspects that a medical illness is causing your insomnia, you may need additional tests. In some patients, an overnight sleep study at a sleep clinic may be necessary. During a sleep study, your brain waves, breathing pattern and oxygen levels can be monitored, and your body movements can be observed.\n",
      "Expected duration of insomnia": "Insomnia may last only one or two nights, or it may continue for weeks, months or years. How long insomnia lasts depends on its cause, and on the success of lifestyle changes and treatment.\n",
      "Preventing insomnia": "It helps to have habits that promote healthy sleep:\nIf you have chronic insomnia because of chronic pain, medical illness or psychiatric problems, seek prompt treatment for your health problem. Don't assume that insomnia is an unavoidable part of your illness.\n",
      "Treating insomnia": "Changes in your bedtime surroundings and habits that can promote sleep are usually the most important way to manage insomnia.\nBehavioral therapies also may be used to treat some patients with insomnia. These therapies include:\nIf insomnia is one of the symptoms of a medical disorder, treating the underlying problem may be all that you need. For example, treating restless legs syndrome with specific medication or sleep apnea with a special mask can markedly improve quality of sleep.\nYour doctor may prescribe sleeping pills for short term or occasional use. Today there are a wide variety of medications to choose from. Some act quickly and are most helpful if you have trouble falling asleep. Others have a longer duration of action when the problem is staying asleep. Many of the medications are available as generics, which tend to be much less expensive. Older people should avoid the longer acting drugs because the sedation can last much longer than eight or nine hours.\nMelatonin, a dietary supplement, works for some people and not others. It has a good safety profile when used in the doses directed on the label.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you are worried about sleeping problems, especially if insufficient sleep or disturbed sleep is interfering with your ability to function normally during the day. Insomnia is an urgent medical problem if sleep problems are making it unsafe for you to drive a car or to perform potentially dangerous tasks at work.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In many people with insomnia, normal sleep patterns return within a few days, especially if a lifestyle issue (stress, a habit of heavy meals before bed, a change in time zones) disappears or is modified.\nIn people with chronic insomnia, the outlook depends on the underlying problem. In people with obstructive sleep apnea, most experience relief when they use a nighttime nose mask that provides modest continuous air pressure through the mouth and nose. This mask must be prescribed by a doctor.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Interstitial cystitis is a puzzling bladder condition, in which the bladder wall becomes irritated or inflamed, causing pain and frequent or painful urination.\n\nThe symptoms of interstitial cystitis are often similar to the symptoms of a urinary tract infection. However, in interstitial cystitis, there is no infection, and the symptoms do not respond to antibiotic treatment.\nThe exact cause of interstitial cystitis remains a mystery, although researchers continue to investigate possible causes, such as unidentified bacteria, an allergic or immune system reaction, a toxic substance in the urine, or a neurological problem in the bladder wall. There also is some evidence that interstitial cystitis may not be just one illness, but several illnesses that share similar symptoms.\nInterstitial cystitis usually occurs between the ages of 20 and 50. Approximately 90% of people with interstitial cystitis are women. It is unknown why interstitial cystitis is more common in women. The disease is not known to be genetic (inherited) or caused by toxins in the environment.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Interstitial cystitis may cause:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about your urine (urine color, odor, presence of blood), symptoms during urination, any pain you are having, and if you are having fever, nausea or vomiting. Your answers to these questions will provide clues about other possible causes of your symptoms, such as a bladder or kidney infection.\nNext, your doctor will examine you and will collect urine from you for laboratory tests that check for signs of infection and infection-causing bacteria. Women usually will need a pelvic exam and men will need a digital rectal exam to check the prostate gland.\nThere is no one sign or test that can tell you immediately if you have interstitial cystitis. Usually, doctors diagnose the condition after a person has had persistent symptoms and no other cause has been found.\nYour doctor probably will refer you to a urologist to help make the diagnosis. He or she will do a test called cystoscopy to look for indications that you have interstitial cystitis and make sure there are no other causes of your symptoms.\nDuring cystoscopy, the urologist uses a small tube like instrument to look inside your bladder and examine its inner lining. In a test called a biopsy a small sample of tissue may be taken from your bladder wall to be examined in a laboratory to look for signs of inflammation and to check for other illnesses, including cancer. During the cystoscopy, your urologist may test your bladder's maximum capacity by filling it with sterile water. This is to determine whether interstitial cystitis has reduced your bladder's ability to hold urine.\n\n",
      "Expected Duration": "How long interstitial cystitis lasts varies. In some people, it is a chronic condition that lasts for many years, while in others, it disappears suddenly. When the condition disappears suddenly, symptoms may return suddenly, even years after the first illness.\n",
      "Prevention": "Since doctors do not know the cause of interstitial cystitis, there is no way to prevent it.\nIn people who already have been diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, symptoms may be less likely to flare up if the patient quits smoking cigarettes; avoids drinking beverages containing alcohol, caffeine or citrus juice; and avoids eating chocolate, spices or high-acid foods, such as tomatoes and citrus fruits.\n",
      "Treatment": "The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms. No one therapy is so successful that it should always be tried first. Often a person with interstitial cystitis needs to try several therapies before finding the right combination. The symptoms of interstitial cystitis may go away over time, but there is no therapy that cures the disorder.\nTreatments include:\n\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Make an appointment to see a doctor if you are urinating more than usual or feel an intense urge to urinate. If you are having fevers or pain or discomfort, especially in the pelvic/bladder area, penis or scrotum, see your doctor soon.\n",
      "Prognosis": "There is no cure for interstitial cystitis and the prognosis is variable. Many patients find that their symptoms come and go. In some patients, symptoms continue to get worse.\n",

      "What is it?": "Arteries are tunnels that blood travels through to get from the heart to various parts of the body. An aneurysm is a bulge in an artery, similar to the bulge that appears at a weak spot of a hose, where the water pressure pushes out to create a bubble. Like the hose bubble, the area of an artery where an aneurysm appears is weak and has the potential to burst.\nAneurysms frequently occur in the arteries that feed the brain. Brain aneurysms are also known as intracranial aneurysms or berry aneurysms (because most of the time they look like little round berries). They occur in up to 6% of people. In general, most brain aneurysms are small, rarely cause symptoms, and have a very low risk of rupture.\nWomen are more likely than men to develop brain aneurysms. A family history of aneurysm increases your risk of having one, as does being older than 50, currently smoking cigarettes, having high blood pressure, and using cocaine. About 20% of people with one brain aneurysm will have at least one more.\nA number of inherited conditions also increase the chance of having an aneurysm, including:\nIf a brain aneurysm does rupture, the consequences can be life-threatening. The risk of rupture is higher with larger aneurysms. Those that are one-fourth of an inch (10 millimeters) or smaller are generally at low risk of rupture.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most brain aneurysms don't cause symptoms until they burst. When an aneurysm ruptures, it often causes bleeding in the brain, which is a medical emergency. Bleeding in the brain usually leads to a very severe headache (often described as \"the worst headache of my life\"). Brief loss of consciousness, nausea and vomiting, changes in vision, or neck stiffness may accompany the headache. If you experience these symptoms, call 911 or get to the emergency room as soon as possible.\nA very large aneurysm may cause symptoms before it bursts, including pain above and behind the eye; numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the face; dilated pupils; and vision changes.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "There are no strict guidelines for who should be tested for the presence of a brain aneurysm. Clearly, any person who has had bleeding into the brain would be tested. Other reasons to proceed with testing include\nMost often, a person is diagnosed with a brain aneurysm after it bursts and starts causing symptoms. Occasionally an aneurysm will be found when a test is done for a different purpose. The following procedures may be used to look for an aneurysm:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once a brain aneurysm forms, it stays for life unless it is surgically removed or bursts.\n",
      "Prevention": "Scientists haven't figured out how to prevent brain aneurysms. However, you can reduce your risk of developing aneurysms by never using tobacco and keeping blood pressure in the normal range.\nIf you know that you have a brain aneurysm, you want to minimize the risk that the aneurysm will burst by\n",
      "Treatment": "If an aneurysm is found before it bursts, a neurosurgeon will help you decide whether you should have it treated. Your overall health, the size of the aneurysm, and its location are all important factors in this decision. If an aneurysm has burst, treatment is definitely necessary.\nThe two surgical treatments for aneurysms are called microvascular clipping and occlusion. For both procedures, the patient is put under general anesthesia and a neurosurgeon temporarily removes part of the skull bone to get access to the aneurysm. In microvascular clipping, the surgeon finds the blood vessel that feeds the aneurysm and places a small, metal, clothespin-like clip on the aneurysm's neck. That way, the aneurysm cannot get blood. The clip stays inside the patient's brain, and the surgeon replaces the skull bone. In most cases, aneurysms do not return after microvascular clipping.\nIn an occlusion, the surgeon clamps off (occludes) the entire artery that leads to the aneurysm. This procedure is often performed when the aneurysm has damaged the artery. Sometimes the surgeon also does a bypass, where a small blood vessel is attached to the brain artery, rerouting the flow of blood away from the section of the damaged artery.\nThere is an alternative to surgery, called endovascular coiling (or coil embolization). For this procedure, the doctor inserts a catheter into an artery, usually in the groin. He or she watches on an angiogram monitor as the catheter snakes through the body to the site of the aneurysm. Coils made of platinum wire are passed through the catheter and directed into the aneurysm. The coils fill the bulge in the artery and cause a blood clot to form. This blocks blood flow into the aneurysm. There is little if any pressure inside the bulge, preventing the aneurysm from getting any larger. The advantage of this procedure is that it is not as invasive as surgery.\nA neurosurgeon's recommendation for surgery or coiling depends on the size and location of the aneurysm, whether the aneurysm has already burst, and the overall health status of the patient.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience a very severe, out-of-the-ordinary headache, call 911 or get to an emergency room. An aneurysm may have burst in your brain. Brief loss of consciousness, nausea and vomiting, changes in vision, or neck stiffness may accompany the headache.\n",
      "Prognosis": "An unruptured aneurysm may never cause problems or symptoms. A burst aneurysm, however, may be fatal or cause serious health problems, such as:\nAfter an aneurysm bursts, if it is not treated, it may burst again and rebleed into the brain. Additional aneurysms, if present, also have a greater risk of rupturing in the future.\nHow a person's body reacts to a burst aneurysm depends on the age and general health of the person, other neurological conditions he or she has, the location of the aneurysm, the extent of bleeding (and rebleeding), and how long passed between the time of the rupture and treatment.\nAbout 40% of people whose aneurysms rupture do not survive the first 24 hours; up to another 25% die from complications within six months. Recovery from treatment may take weeks to months. Generally, people who are treated for an unruptured aneurysm recover more quickly than people whose aneurysms have burst.\n",

      "What is it?": "Iron deficiency is an abnormally low level of iron in the body.\nIron is an essential mineral found in red meat and certain plant based foods. In the body, iron is needed to form myoglobin, a protein in muscle cells, and it is essential for certain enzymes that drive the body's chemical reactions. In the bone marrow, iron is used to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying chemical inside the body's red blood cells. If iron levels fall too low, it causes iron deficiency anemia. When this happens, red blood cells become smaller than normal and contain less hemoglobin.\nIron deficiency can occur in infants, adolescents and pregnant women because of the heavy demands for iron associated with rapid body growth. Iron deficiency is especially common in premenopausal women because of regular loss of iron with menstrual periods.\nIron deficiency also can happen because of any of the following:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Mild iron deficiency may not cause any symptoms. When iron deficiency has progressed to actual anemia, there can be fatigue, breathlessness, unusually pale skin, and a decreased ability to exercise. People who have had severe iron deficiency for a prolonged period sometimes complain of trouble swallowing or have a sore mouth or tongue. In some cases, there can be unusually brittle fingernails or an abnormal curling and softness of the nails called spooning.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your diet and symptoms, including any signs of abnormal menstrual, rectal or urinary tract bleeding. Your doctor will examine you to check for unusual paleness in your skin and fingernails, and for other nail abnormalities. He or she may examine your rectum to see whether blood is being lost in the gastrointestinal tract.\nThe main test used to diagnose iron deficiency is a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC). If there is still doubt about the cause of anemia after a CBC, further testing may include checking the blood levels of iron and ferritin, a protein that binds iron in the blood, which may more accurately reflect the body's iron levels.\nWhen abnormal iron loss is suspected because of bleeding, additional tests will be ordered to check for blood in the stool or urine, and to identify the cause of the blood loss. In women with abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding, a full gynecological exam and often other tests may be necessary.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Iron deficiency will last as long as its cause persists. Iron supplements taken by mouth begin increasing the body's production of red blood cells within three to 10 days. Iron usually needs to be taken for many months to bring the levels back to normal.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can prevent iron deficiency by eating a well-balanced diet that includes lean meat, green vegetables, beans, fruits and whole grain bread. Pregnant women and growing children are especially susceptible to insufficient dietary iron intake. Pregnant women usually are advised to take an iron supplement.\n",
      "Treatment": "Iron deficiency usually is treated with iron tablets, syrups (for children) or injections. If iron deficiency was caused by abnormal blood loss, the cause of bleeding also must be diagnosed and treated.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have any of the symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. If you have abnormal bleeding, such as blood in your stool or excessively heavy menstrual periods, call your doctor immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "After about six months of daily iron tablets, the body's iron stores usually will return to normal in an average adult who has had an iron-poor diet. When this doesn't happen, it is often because the person has not taken iron tablets as directed or because iron loss due to abnormal bleeding exceeds the amount of iron taken in. Many people stop taking iron tablets because iron irritates the gastrointestinal tract or causes constipation.\n",

      "What is IBS?": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that causes a variety of symptoms, including:\n\nThe severity of the disorder varies from person to person. Some people experience symptoms that come and go and are just mildly annoying. Others have such severe daily bowel problems that IBS affects their ability to work, sleep, and enjoy life.\nIn addition, symptoms may change over time. A person may have severe symptoms for several weeks and then feel well for months or even years.\nMost people are never cured of IBS. However, the disorder is not related to any other disease. It does not develop into colitis. People with IBS do not have an increased risk of colon cancer.\nIBS usually starts in early adulthood. It affects twice as many women as men. Approximately 10% to 20% of the population has IBS, but half of all people with the condition never seek medical care for their symptoms.\nNo one knows what causes IBS. Some studies suggest that the nerves of the colon may be much more sensitive than usual in people with IBS. The normal movement of food and gas through the colon causes pain, intestinal spasms, and an irregular pattern of bowel movements.\nStress does not cause IBS, but stress can increase the frequency and severity of symptoms.\nIBS has been called irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis, and functional bowel disease.\n",
      "Symptoms of IBS": "People with IBS may have some or all of these symptoms:\nAlthough the symptoms of IBS often change over time, people tend to develop their own pattern. For example, some people have mostly diarrhea, some have mostly constipation, and others have abdominal pain without a major change in bowel movements.\n",
      "Diagnosing IBS": "There is no test for IBS. Your doctor will diagnose IBS if you have the typical symptoms and have been tested for other disorders that can cause similar symptoms.\nYour doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. Your doctor will examine you, testing your abdomen for tenderness and feeling to determine whether internal organs are larger than normal. The doctor will check for fever or weight loss. If you have any of these signs, you likely have something other than IBS.\nDepending on your medical history, your doctor may do tests to eliminate other diseases that may cause similar symptoms. These tests might include:\nYour doctor may suggest that you stop eating or drinking certain foods for up to three weeks to determine if your diet is contributing to your symptoms. For example, your doctor may ask you to eliminate milk products if he or she suspects lactose intolerance.\n",
      "Expected duration of IBS": "IBS symptoms may be a daily problem throughout a person's life. Symptoms may come and go, lasting a day, a week, or a month before disappearing. Dietary changes with or without medication may help to reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms.\n",
      "Preventing IBS": "Because no one knows what causes IBS, it is impossible to prevent the disorder. Once diagnosed with IBS, a person may be able to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms by reducing stress or changing the diet.\n",
      "Treating IBS": "Changing your diet may improve symptoms dramatically. It often takes a long time to discover what works well for you, and you may need to alter your original program if symptoms flare.\nKeep track of the different foods you eat throughout the day. See which foods seem to make your symptoms worse. After you discover your particular trigger foods, eliminate them from your diet. Some common IBS trigger foods include:\nThe way you eat may help to create IBS symptoms. Eating large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often may help some people with IBS. Eating quickly can cause you to swallow air, which can cause belching or gas.\nAdding fiber to your diet, especially if constipation is one of your main symptoms, often helps to regulate your bowel movements and reduce abdominal discomfort. At first, fiber will increase the amount of gas in your system, so add fiber gradually. Over time, the body adjusts to the effects of fiber and the gassiness will decrease. Fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain breads and cereals are good food sources of fiber.\nYour doctor may recommend a fiber supplement. Some experts believe that the fiber methylcellulose creates the least amount of gas, and brands of this fiber are often recommended for people with IBS. Psyllium is also a good source of fiber.\nA low-FODMAP diet helps relieve symptoms for many people with IBS. You need to review a list of foods that have a high amount of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, and reduce their intake.\nIf your symptoms are not relieved after you eliminate trigger foods and add fiber, your doctor may prescribe medications.\nFor people that have frequent loose stools (diarrhea-predominant IBS), medication options include:\nFor people with constipation-predominant IBS, fiber and plenty of fluids are the mainstays of therapy. If medication is needed, your doctor may prescribe an osmotic laxative such as lactulose.\nOther drugs available for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome include:\nBoth drugs act on the cells that line the inside of the intestines. They promote increased fluid secretion into the intestine, making stool passage easier.\nStress reduction through mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other practices, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can be extremely helpful.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "It is useful for anyone with irritable bowel symptoms to discuss their symptoms with a doctor, so that diet, fiber, stress reduction, and drug treatment strategies can be planned.\nAfter you have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, contact your doctor if you have:\n",
      "Prognosis": "There is no cure for IBS. But most people can lessen the symptoms by making dietary changes, reducing stress, and — if necessary — taking medication.\n",

      "What is it?": "Jet lag is a type of sleep disorder that is a reaction to traveling between time zones.\nOur bodies naturally develop a sleep-wake cycle that is tied to the patterns of light and dark in our environment. This cycle, called the circadian rhythm, affects many body processes, including temperature and hormone levels.\nBecause traveling between time zones changes the light-dark patterns in your environment, it can disrupt your body's rhythms. A change of even a few hours may not seem significant, but often it is enough to affect the body's sleep-wake cycle. For example, a Californian who travels to New York may receive a wake-up call at 7 a.m., but his or her body still is running on California time, where it is only 4 a.m.\nThe effects of jet lag go beyond being tired for a few extra hours. Because the disruption in the sleep-wake cycle affects your body's hormone levels, many body processes can be thrown off balance, leading to a variety of symptoms.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of jet lag can be mild or severe, depending on the number of time zones you cross and your sensitivity to such changes. The more time zones you cross, the more likely it is that your body rhythms will be disrupted, which can lead to more severe symptoms. Most people who cross five or more time zones will experience at least some symptoms, which can include\n",
      "Diagnosis": "There are no tests for jet lag, although the cause usually is obvious. If you have typical symptoms, you do not need to seek medical attention.\nIf you have symptoms of jet lag lasting longer than two weeks, it is possible that something else is triggering your sleep difficulty. Your doctor may suggest an evaluation to check for other disorders.\n",
      "Expected duration": "For each time zone crossed during travel, it takes about a day to adjust to the new environment. For example, it can take up to three days for a person traveling from California to New York to feel \"normal\" again. If that person travels back to California after adjusting to New York time, it can take another three days to readjust to California time.\nOlder people seem to be hit harder by jet lag and may require a little more time to adjust. Traveling from west to east can cause more bothersome symptoms because the body has more difficulty adjusting its clock forward than backward.\n",
      "Prevention": "Although nothing will prevent jet lag completely, travelers can do a few things to limit its effects:\n",
      "Treatment": "Some people believe that the hormone melatonin helps to decrease jet lag. This hormone, which can be purchased over the counter as a supplement, is taken about 30 minutes before bed on the day of travel and for up to four days after arrival, usually at a dose of about 3 milligrams. Smaller doses (1 milligram) also may work, and some people need higher doses, about 5 milligrams.\nMelatonin generally does not cause serious side effects, although there is little information on its long-term safety. Possible short-term side effects include daytime sleepiness, dizziness, headache, disorientation, loss of appetite, and nausea. Melatonin is considered a nutritional supplement, and therefore it is not closely regulated.\nPrescription medications, such as benzodiazepines, may help decrease jet lag. This is particularly true for people who have difficulty falling asleep after traveling to a very different time zone.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Usually, it is not necessary to call a doctor to treat jet lag. However, you should call a health care professional if symptoms have not cleared up within two weeks.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Jet lag is a mild problem that goes away on its own within several days. People with regular routines and older people may have less ability to tolerate shifts in their light-dark cycles and may take slightly longer to recover. However, even for these people, all symptoms should disappear within two weeks.\n",

      "What is it?": "The term \"jock itch\" typically describes an itchy rash in the groin. Although there are many causes of jock itch, this term has become synonymous with tinea cruris, a common fungal infection that affects the groin and inner thighs.Tineais the name of the fungus; cruris comes from the Latin word for leg.\nJock itch can develop when tight garments trap moisture and heat. This creates an environment in which fungi multiply and flourish. Athletes often get jock itch. It occurs more commonly in men, but can affect women as well. The jock itch fungus may cause a rash on the upper and inner thighs, the armpits, and the area just underneath the breasts. Many people with tinea cruris also have athlete's foot. Athlete's foot is calledtinea pedis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A flat, red, itchy rash first appears high on the inner side of one or both thighs. It spreads outward in a ringlike circular pattern while the center clears up partially. The border is sharply marked, slightly raised and often beefy red in color. Jock itch can spread to the pubic and genital regions and sometimes to the buttocks.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor often can make the diagnosis just by looking at the rash. Your doctor may gently scrape the skin to get a sample to look for fungi under the microscope. With stubborn cases, your doctor may send the sample to a laboratory to pinpoint the fungus that's causing the trouble. Other causes of a rash in the groin include yeast infection of the skin, seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Jock itch usually can be treated within weeks, although it commonly comes back. Treatment for chronic (long-lasting) infections may last one or two months.\n",
      "Prevention": "The healthier you are, the less likely you are to get conditions such as diabetes that increase the risk of a fungal infection. Remaining healthy through diet, rest and exercise is the first step in avoiding fungal infection.\nHere are other steps you can take to remain fungus-free:\n",
      "Treatment": "Most likely, your doctor will prescribe a topical antifungal treatment for you to apply once or twice a day for at least two weeks. If you have athlete's foot, your doctor should treat that as well. Untreated athlete's foot can cause jock itch to return.\nBecause jock itch commonly comes back, you need to be extra cautious. You can apply powder daily to help keep the area dry. The itching can be alleviated with an over-the-counter treatment such as Sarna lotion. You also should avoid hot baths and tight-fitting clothing. Men should wear boxer shorts rather than briefs.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you develop a skin rash.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Treatment for jock itch is quick and usually effective, but the condition often comes back. The following people should be especially vigilant to prevent the problem from returning:\n",

      "What is it?": "Arthritis involves inflammation of the joints that causes pain and swelling. Although many people believe arthritis is a disease of old age, various forms of arthritis can affect just about anyone at any age. When arthritis occurs in children younger than age 16, it is called juvenile arthritis. According to the Arthritis Foundation, about 300,000 children in the United States have some form of the disease.\nThe most common forms of juvenile arthritis are:\nThere are several subcategories of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary depending on the child and the specific disorder. Common symptoms include:\nOther symptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Juvenile arthritis is difficult to diagnose because many diseases have similar symptoms, and there is no single test that pinpoints the diagnosis. If your child shows signs of juvenile arthritis, you likely will be referred to a pediatric rheumatologist. The rheumatologist will look at your child's medical history to find clues. For example, one of the primary diagnostic criteria for juvenile idiopathic arthritis is joint inflammation that has lasted for at least six weeks.\nYour doctor may order blood tests to look for antibodies that commonly form in people with some types of arthritis, although these antibodies are often absent in children. X-rays may be performed to look for damage to cartilage or, in severe cases, bone. Other tests may also be done to look for other conditions that could explain the symptoms, such as tests for infection. Lyme disease is an infectious cause of arthritis that may affect children and mimic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Juvenile arthritis usually is a lifelong condition. However, for many people, symptoms gradually lessen or disappear as they enter adulthood.\n",
      "Prevention": "Because no one knows what causes juvenile arthritis, there is no way to prevent it.\n",
      "Treatment": "The main goal of treatment is to control inflammation to stop further damage to the joints, and to control symptoms so that the child can function well. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually the first medications tried to relieve joint inflammation. They work by decreasing the amount of an enzyme found in affected joints that promotes inflammation. This same enzyme, however, helps to protect the stomach, so NSAIDs often cause stomach irritation and ulcers. Low doses of NSAIDs are available over-the-counter, including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and other brand names) and naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve and others). Celecoxib (Celebrex) is a newer prescription drug, called a COX-2 inhibitor that is thought to be safer for the stomach because it does not have as much of an effect on the enzyme that protects the stomach.\nIn moderate to severe cases, children with juvenile arthritis may be treated with more powerful medications or a combination of medicines. Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) are fast-acting, anti-inflammatory agents that may be used to stop dangerous inflammation, such as when the lining of the heart has become inflamed (pericarditis) or to stabilize a child in an acute stage of the disease. However, these drugs can have very serious side effects, including weight gain, weakened bones, an increased susceptibility to infections and interference with growth. They usually are prescribed for only a short time. They must be taken exactly as directed.\nOther drugs, called disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) — such as methotrexate (Rheumatrex and others) — act more slowly, but often provide relief if other medications have failed. These drugs can cause liver damage or other complications, so doctors will carefully monitor blood tests in children taking DMARDs. Other medications may be effective, including hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), leflunomide (Arava), azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune). Thalidomide may be effective for certain children with JRA, but care must be taken to avoid pregnancy while taking this drug and it can cause nerve damage.\nNewer, injectable treatments, including adalimumab (Humira), etanercept (Enbrel), abatacept (Orencia) and tocilizumab (Actemra) may be effective for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Infliximab (Remicade), anakinra (Kineret), canakinumab (Ilaris) and rituximab (Rituxan) can also be highly effective for some children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Surgery sometimes is required if joint damage is severe or joint deformity has developed.\nChildren with juvenile arthritis should be encouraged to maintain as normal a life as possible. Although there may be pain, exercise is important to help the joints keep moving and functioning well. Once symptoms are under control, it's good for your child to engage in usual play and sports activities. In severe cases, physical therapy may be recommended to keep the joints moving as freely as possible.\nTutoring or special attention from teachers may be needed if the child misses many weeks of school due to illness. Also, counseling might be recommended to help the child deal with the emotional aspects of having a long-lasting (chronic) illness.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call a health care professional if a child develops fever or rash along with symptoms of arthritis, such as persistent joint pain, swollen joints, limping and limited motion.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Because the symptoms and damage caused by juvenile arthritis can vary greatly, the outlook also varies significantly. Some types of arthritis have periods of flaring up and periods when symptoms subside. Treatment can control symptoms for most people, and some children \"outgrow\" the illness. However, severe forms of the disease can cause growth problems if the growth plates in the long bones are damaged. Children who are very ill also can miss long periods of school, and joint damage can cause long-term joint problems. In addition, the medications used to treat juvenile arthritis can cause other problems, including stomach ulcers, weakened bones and liver damage.\n",

      "What is Kawasaki disease?": "Kawasaki disease is a rare illness that typically strikes children younger than age 5. It is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. Kawasaki disease is a mysterious illness of unknown cause, although some scientists suspect that the cause may be an infection (such as a virus or a toxin from a bacterium.\nKawasaki disease was first identified among Japanese children in 1967. Within nine years, the illness had been reported in American children living in Hawaii. Although researchers assume that Kawasaki disease could have been caused by an infection that was carried between Japan and Hawaii, this has never been confirmed. Recent evidence suggests that inherited (genetic) factors may also be important. But the cause of Kawasaki disease remains a mystery.\nKawasaki disease makes children ill by triggering inflammation in many different parts of the body. In the heart, this inflammation can take the form of myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle), pericarditis (inflammation of membranes covering the heart), or valvulitis (inflammation of the heart valves). Kawasaki disease can cause a type of meningitis (inflammation of membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). It can also cause inflammation in the skin, eyes, lungs, lymph nodes, joints, and mouth.\nThe most dangerous problem related to Kawasaki disease is the threat of vasculitis (blood vessel inflammation), especially in the body's medium-sized arteries. This vasculitis can be especially dangerous when it damages the heart's coronary arteries, causing an abnormal widening (dilation) or bulge (aneurysm) in these vessels. In rare cases, artery damage related to Kawasaki disease can significantly interfere with the heart's blood supply, even to the point of causing a heart attack in a young child.\nIn the United States and other industrialized nations, Kawasaki disease is now the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children. Most often, children with heart problems have them at birth.\nKawasaki disease is rather rare, affecting less than one in 5,000 children under the age of 5 in the U.S. Seventy-five percent to 80% of the cases are children under the age of 5 years old. Boys are affected more often than girls.\n",
      "Symptoms of Kawasaki disease": "Because there is no test available to confirm that a person has Kawasaki disease, doctors define the condition by the combination of problems that it produces. The typical person with this disease has a high fever (usually 104° Fahrenheit or above) for at least five days. This fever usually occurs together with at least four of the following additional symptoms:\nPeople with Kawasaki disease can have other symptoms that are not part of the definition of the disease. These can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing Kawasaki disease": "Because Kawasaki disease is rare in the U.S., doctors will want to check for other illnesses that are more common and cause similar symptoms.\nIf your doctor suspects that your child has Kawasaki disease, he or she may begin by asking you about:\nAs part of the diagnostic workup for Kawasaki disease, your doctor may suggest blood tests and diagnostic procedures to check for other infectious or noninfectious causes of your child's symptoms.\nOnce it becomes clear that Kawasaki disease is a possibility, your doctor may schedule an echocardiogram, a painless test that uses sound waves to outline the heart's structure. This allows the doctor to check for any dilation or aneurysms in the coronary arteries. In some cases, your doctor may recommend coronary angiography, a procedure in which dye is injected into the arteries that supply the heart to look for evidence of aneurysm or narrowing typical of Kawasaki disease.\nYour doctor will diagnose Kawasaki disease if your child has symptoms that fit the definition of the illness and if there is no other explanation for these symptoms. Researchers continue to look for a simple, reliable diagnostic test for this illness, but, so far none is available.\n",
      "Expected duration of Kawasaki disease": "Kawasaki disease lasts for several weeks, progressing through three different stages:\n",
      "Preventing Kawasaki disease": "Because the cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown, there is no way to prevent it.\n",
      "Treating Kawasaki disease": "Kawasaki disease is treated with a single dose of gamma globulin, given intravenously (into a vein), together with aspirin taken by mouth. Gamma globulin is a purified collection of proteins and antibodies from donated blood. It is not known why it is effective against this disease. The gamma globulin injections may be repeated over several days if fever continues.\nThe sooner treatment with gamma globulin is started, the better it works. For example, complications of Kawasaki disease, including coronary artery aneurysms, may be prevented with early treatment. But if started 10 or more days after symptoms begin, gamma globulin treatment may not prevent these aneurysms.\nUsually parents are warned against giving aspirin to children because it can trigger Reye's disease, a serious disorder that can damage the brain and liver. However, aspirin is the best treatment for Kawasaki disease. So for children with this condition, the proven benefits outweigh the small risk of Reye's disease. The child usually continues to take aspirin for six to eight weeks after the acute symptoms of Kawasaki disease subside.\nOther treatments, including corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications such as infliximab, cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide, are sometimes recommended if gamma globulin injections are not effective. Occasionally, a procedure called plasmapheresis may be recommended for Kawasaki disease that does not respond to other treatments. In plasmapheresis, blood is removed, filtered to remove proteins (including antibodies), and then returned to the body.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if your child develops a high fever, with or without other symptoms of Kawasaki disease.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Without proper treatment, about one in five children with Kawasaki disease develops aneurysms in their coronary arteries. With proper treatment, this is much less common. There are other effects on coronary arteries and the heart muscle that can be seen with Kawasaki disease, but they are usually temporary. However, coronary artery disease and other heart problems can develop later in people who had Kawasaki disease, so periodic re-evaluation is recommended for all children who have had Kawasaki disease.\nKawasaki disease can also affect blood vessels in other parts of the body, such as the gastrointestinal tract. It can cause problems with the kidneys, although this is rare, and hearing loss, although it is usually temporary.\nThe risk of death is low, but it is important to recognize the condition early so that treatment can be started quickly.\n",

      "What is it?": "Keloids are raised overgrowths of scar tissue that occur at the site of a skin injury. They occur where trauma, surgery, blisters, vaccinations, acne or body piercing have injured the skin. Less commonly, keloids may form in places where the skin has not had a visible injury. Keloids differ from normal mature scars in composition and size. Some people are prone to keloid formation and may develop them in several places.\n\nKeloids are more common in African-Americans. They are seen most commonly on the shoulders, upper back and chest, but they can occur anywhere. When a keloid is associated with a skin incision or injury, the keloid scar tissue continues to grow for a time after the original wound has closed, becoming larger and more visible until it reaches a final size. They generally occur between 10 and 30 years of age and affect both sexes equally, although they may be more common among young women with pierced ears. Keloids may form over the breastbone in people who have had open heart surgery.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Keloids usually appear in areas of previous trauma but may extend beyond the injured area. They are shiny, smooth and rounded skin elevations that may be pink, purple, or brown. They can be doughy or firm and rubbery to the touch, and they often feel itchy, tender or uncomfortable. They may be unsightly. A large keloid in the skin over a joint may interfere with joint function.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A doctor diagnoses a keloid on the basis of its appearance and a history of tissue injury, such as surgery, acne or body piercing. In rare cases, the doctor may remove a small piece of the skin to examine under a microscope. This is called a biopsy.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Keloids may continue to grow slowly for weeks, months or years. They eventually stop growing but do not disappear on their own. Once a keloid develops, it is permanent unless removed or treated successfully. It is common for keloids that have been removed or treated to return.\n",
      "Prevention": "People who are prone to keloids should avoid cosmetic surgery. When surgery is necessary in such people, doctors can take special precautions to minimize the formation of keloids at the site of the incision. Examples of techniques that might be used to minimize keloid formation include covering the healing wound with hypoallergenic paper tape for several weeks after surgery, covering the wound with small sheets made of a silicone gel after the surgery, or using a topical corticosteroid at the site of the surgical wound at the beginning of the healing period.\n",
      "Treatment": "There is no single treatment for keloids, and most treatments do not give completely satisfying results. Two or more treatments may be combined. If you decide to pursue treatment for a keloid scar, you will have the best results if you start treatment soon after the keloid appears. Available treatments include:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Keloids are primarily a cosmetic concern. If a scar becomes enlarged, itchy, uncomfortable, interferes with the movement of a joint, or creates an unacceptable cosmetic effect, discuss treatment options with your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Keloids are harmless, cosmetic problems that do not become cancerous (malignant). Once a keloid stops growing, it usually remains stable unless the area is injured again.\n",

      "What Is keratitis?": "Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea, the outermost part of the eye that covers the pupil and iris (the colored ring around the pupil). The most common causes of keratitis are eye dryness, infection and injury.\nBacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal infections can cause keratitis. An infectious keratitis can happen after an injury to the cornea. But an injury can inflame the cornea without an infection occurring.\nViral keratitis occurs quite commonly and the types of viruses include:\nBacterial keratitis occurs less often than viral keratitis. Parasitic and fungal keratitis is rarely seen in developed countries.\nInfectious keratitis usually begins by affecting the outer layer of the cornea, but it can go deeper into the cornea, increasing the risk of impaired vision.\nNon-infectious keratitis is a feature of some autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. In these conditions, keratitis is often a complication of eye dryness.\nTrauma to the front of the eye, as may occur with poorly fitting contact lenses, surgery on the cornea (including LASIK surgery), or any other injury to the cornea may lead to keratitis.\nPeople who wear contact lenses are at increased risk for infectious keratitis.  Lens wear should stop immediately if a person suspects that he or she is developing an eye infection.\n",
      "Symptoms of keratitis": "Symptoms of keratitis include:\nWhen caused by an injury or infection, such as herpes simplex virus, keratitis usually affects only one eye, but both eyes may be affected when keratitis is due to other causes.\n",
      "Diagnosing keratitis": "Your health care professional will ask you about your symptoms, your vision, and your health in general. Your doctor, or an eye specialist, will use an instrument that magnifies the surface of the cornea to look for a tiny ulcer caused by viral infection. This ulcer when due to herpes simplex tends to send out star-like branches, and is best seen after a dye is used to stain the cornea temporarily. Herpes simplex infection of the cornea may be accompanied by infection of the eyelid. In this case, tiny, painful blisters resembling cold sores of the lips may appear on the eyelid.\nYour doctor also may:\n",
      "Expected duration of keratitis": "Keratitis caused by a virus or bacterium tends to get better relatively quickly. Herpes keratitis and bacterial keratitis are treated with antiviral medication or antibiotics. Keratitis caused by other viruses usually gets better on their own within a few days.\nIf keratitis is related only to contact lenses, the duration tends to be brief.\nKeratitis caused by autoimmune disease, some parasites or prior injury can be difficult to treat and may be long lasting (chronic). In these cases, permanent damage to the cornea with impaired vision may occur despite intense treatment.\n",
      "Preventing keratitis": "The best way to prevent keratitis is to avoid eye injury by wearing sunglasses and appropriate eye gear as needed.\nIf you have a cold sore, do not put your fingers to your eyes, because that could spread the infection. If there is any suspicion that you have herpes simplex virus, steroid eye drops may be dangerous because they can make this infection worse.\nMost keratitis due to syphilis infection is congenital (present at birth); it can be prevented by treatment of an infected person during pregnancy. Testing for syphilis during pregnancy is routine.\nGood contact lens hygiene, a balanced diet and moisturizing eye drops may help prevent other causes of keratitis.\n",
      "Treating keratitis": "Treatment of keratitis depends upon the cause. If there is mild injury to the cornea, such as a scratched cornea, no specific treatment is necessary. An antibiotic ointment might be prescribed. This is done mostly for comfort.\nIf the keratitis is caused by herpes simplex or the herpes zoster virus that causes shingles, your doctor will prescribe antiviral eye drops or an antiviral oral medication or both. Bacterial keratitis needs to be treated with antibiotics. Depending on the severity of the infection, an oral antibiotic may be prescribed along with an antibiotic ointment or eye drops. Topical and systemic treatments are available for fungal keratitis.\nArtificial tears for lubrication usually are effective for keratitis related to ocular dryness. Keratitis caused by an autoimmune disease is often treated with topical corticosteroid eye drops. Also treating the underlying disease helps the keratitis heal with less chance of recurrence.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "The seriousness of keratitis varies widely, but you should call your doctor promptly if symptoms develop, especially if you have pain or your vision is impaired. Depending on how severe your symptoms are, your doctor may send you directly to an eye specialist who has special equipment for evaluating eye conditions.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis for most cases of keratitis is very favorable. With early treatment of keratitis caused by herpes simplex, shingles, or bacteria, most people will heal without loss of vision. Early treatment of parasitic and fungal keratitis also is essential. But even with appropriate treatment, the infection may persist. If vision is very impaired, your eye specialist may suggest corneal transplant.\n",

      "What is it?": "In kidney failure, the kidneys lose their ability to filter enough waste products from the blood and to regulate the body's balance of salt and water. Eventually, the kidneys slow their production of urine, or stop producing it completely. Waste products and water accumulate in the body.\nThis can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. Excess fluid can accumulate in the lungs and extreme changes in blood chemistry can affect the function of the heart and brain. There are three general categories of kidney failure (also called renal failure). They are:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary depending on the type of renal injury or failure.\nIf left untreated, acute kidney injury may progress to renal failure, which can cause extra fluid to back up behind the heart into the lungs, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, confusion and behavioral changes.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If you have an illness or medical condition that increases the risk of acute kidney injury, your doctor will watch for symptoms and signs of kidney failure. He or she may give you blood and urine tests and measure the amount of urine you produce. If you have a chronic (long-term) medical condition that increases the risk of long-term kidney damage, your doctor will check your blood pressure and look for symptoms and signs of chronic renal failure during regularly scheduled office visits.\nTo confirm the diagnosis of acute kidney injury, your doctor will order tests of your urine and blood tests to check for chemical abnormalities. Levels of these chemicals are elevated in people with poor kidney function. Other tests may include:\nIf you have symptoms or a chronic medical condition that is known to potentially cause kidney failure, your doctor will periodically order blood tests to check on kidney function. Because chronic renal failure typically develops gradually, a physical examination may be normal. To confirm the diagnosis of chronic renal failure, the same evaluation may be recommended as for acute kidney injury, including tests of blood and urine, ultrasound of kidneys and in some cases, a kidney biopsy.\nDoctors diagnose end-stage renal disease when symptoms become pronounced and certain blood chemicals reach very high levels in the blood, indicating that kidney function has been severely affected.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Acute kidney injury may go away within a few days simply by stopping a medication or reversing whatever caused the situation. Exactly how long the illness lasts varies considerably from person to person, depending on the cause of the kidney problem. In rare cases, acute kidney injury progresses to end-stage renal disease.\nChronic renal failure is a lifelong problem that can worsen over time to become end-stage renal disease. End-stage renal disease is a permanent condition that can be treated only with dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n",
      "Prevention": "Many forms of kidney injury or failure cannot be prevented. People who have diabetes, high blood pressure or coronary artery disease should try to control the illness with appropriate diet, medication and lifestyle changes. Before a computed tomography (CT) scan or angiogram procedure that uses contrast dye, your doctor will want to be sure that your kidneys can handle the dye load. Also your doctor will want you to be well hydrated with either oral or intravenous fluids.\nIf you already have chronic kidney failure, treating medical problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure and avoiding medications and other treatments that can further damage the kidneys may prevent worsening of kidney function. If you have chronic kidney failure, you should tell any physician who treats you.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the type of kidney injury or renal failure.\n\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Many people with acute kidney injury that progresses to acute renal failure are already hospitalized for their other medical conditions. Other people should call a health care professional whenever the amount of urine they produce either increases or decreases markedly. In people with decreased urine output, swelling of the face and ankles is another danger sign, especially if there is also shortness of breath. For people with chronic renal failure, it is a good idea to check with your health care professional whenever a new medication is prescribed.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most children with acute kidney injury have a good outlook for recovering their kidney function, although in rare cases, end-stage renal disease can develop. Among adults, the chances of recovery depend primarily on the underlying reason for acute kidney injury.\nPeople with chronic renal failure may have a continuing decrease in kidney function, but not everyone develops end-stage renal disease. For those who do, the time it takes for end-stage renal disease to develop varies from person to person.\n",

      "What are kidney stones?": "Kidney stones are abnormal, hard, chemical deposits that form inside the kidneys. This condition also is called nephrolithiasis orurolithiasis.\nKidney stones are often as small as grains of sand. They pass out of the body in urine without causing discomfort.\nHowever, the deposits can be much larger — the size of a pea, a marble or even larger. Some of these larger stones are too big to be flushed from the kidney.\nSome kidney stones manage to travel into the ureter. This is the narrow tube between the kidney and bladder. The stones may become trapped in the ureter. Trapped kidney stones can cause many different symptoms. These include:\nThere are several different types of stones. They form for a variety of reasons. Kidney stones are grouped into four different families, based on their chemical composition:\n",
      "Symptoms of kidney stones": "Very small kidney stones may pass out of the body in the urine without causing symptoms.\nLarger stones may become trapped in the narrow ureter. This can cause\nThe location of pain may shift downward, closer to the groin. This usually indicates that the stone has traveled downward in the ureter and is now closer to the bladder. As the stone approaches the bladder, you may feel\nWhen stones pass out of your body in your urine, you may see the stones exit.\n",
      "Diagnosing kidney stones": "Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. He or she will ask about any change in the color of your urine. Your doctor will want to know about your family history of kidney stones, and whether you have had gout.\nYour doctor will check your urine for red blood cells. He or she may order a computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound. The CT scan can show an actual stone. The ultrasound usually cannot detect the actual stone. But an ultrasound can show swelling of the kidney and/or ureter which indicates that the stone is obstructing urine flow.\nIf you are able to collect a stone that you passed from your urine, your doctor will send the stone to a laboratory for chemical analysis. Blood and urine tests may be done to identify a treatable cause of the stone.\nIf you do not have any symptoms and you find a small kidney stone in your urine, strain out the stone and save it for your doctor. Your doctor can send the stone to a medical laboratory for chemical analysis.\n",
      "Expected duration of kidney stones": "When a kidney stone becomes trapped in the ureter, it may remain there until your doctor removes it. Or, it eventually may move downward and pass on its own. It can take hours, days or weeks for a stone to pass.\nAs a rule, the smaller the stone, the more likely it is to pass on its own. The larger the stone, the greater the risk that it will remain trapped in the ureter. A trapped stone can significantly obstruct the flow of urine.\n",
      "Preventing kidney stones": "In general, you can help to prevent kidney stones by drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding dehydration. This dilutes your urine and decreases the chance that chemicals will combine to form stones.\nYou can prevent calcium oxalate stones by eating dairy products and other calcium-rich foods. Taking calcium supplements, however, can increase the risk of stone formation.\nPeople who excrete too much oxalate into their urine should avoid eating foods high in oxalate. These foods include beets, spinach, chard and rhubarb. Tea, coffee, cola, chocolate and nuts also contain oxalate, but these can be used in moderation. Eating too much salt and meat can cause more kidney stones to form.\nAfter your doctor receives an analysis of the chemical composition of your kidney stones, he or she can suggest medications or changes in your diet that will help to prevent stones from forming in the future.\nCertain medications may increase the risk of stones. So your doctor may want to adjust your regular medications if you have had kidney stones.\n",
      "Treating kidney stones": "In many cases, a trapped kidney stone eventually flushes out of the urinary tract on its own, especially if you drink plenty of fluids. With a doctor's supervision, it is likely that you can remain at home. You can take pain medicine as needed until the stone dislodges and flushes away.\nIf the stone is lodged in the ureter, doctors often prescribe tamsulosin. The drug is an alpha blocker that helps relax the ureter and may allow easier passage of the stone.\nIn some cases, it is necessary to have your stone removed or broken into fragments that can pass more easily. This may be the case if\nDoctors have several options for destroying stones lodged in the urinary tract:\nIt is rare that surgery is required to remove a kidney stone.\nOnce a kidney stone has been removed, you can sometimes prevent new stones from forming with medications or changes in diet.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have\nTrapped kidney stones can lead to a urinary tract infection. Call your doctor if you have fever and chills, or if your urine becomes cloudy or foul smelling.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis varies from person to person. Up to half of people who pass a kidney stone will never pass a second. For people with a recurrent kidney stone, the prognosis depends on the cause of the kidney stones and the response to preventive therapies.\n",

      "What is it?": "A knee sprain is an injury of the ligaments, tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect the bones of the upper and lower leg at the knee joint. The knee joint has four major ligaments.\n\nLike other types of sprains, knee sprains are classified according to a grading system:\nWhen one knee ligament suffers a serious sprain, there is a good chance that other parts of the knee may also be injured. For example, because the MCL helps to protect the ACL from certain types of extreme knee forces, the ACL can become vulnerable to injury when the MCL is torn. In more than half of moderate or severe MCL sprains, the ACL also is sprained.\nKnee sprains are very common. ACL sprains tend to cause more significant symptoms compared to MCL injuries. Many MCL sprains are so mild that they don't result in a visit to a doctor.\nMore than any other group, competitive athletes have a very high risk of knee sprains and other types of knee problems. In U.S. high schools, the knee is the most frequently injured joint among athletes who compete in football, soccer or wrestling.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a knee sprain vary depending on the specific ligament that is torn:\n",
      "ACL sprain": "",
      "PCL sprain": "",
      "MCL sprain": "",
      "LCL sprain": "",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will want to know exactly how you hurt your knee. He or she will ask about:\nThe doctor will examine both your knees, comparing your injured knee with your uninjured one. During this exam, the doctor will check your injured knee for signs of swelling, deformity, tenderness, fluid inside the knee joint and discoloration. If you don't have too much pain and swelling, the doctor will evaluate your knee's range of motion and will pull against the ligaments to check their strength. During the exam, you will bend your knee and the doctor will gently pull forward or push backward on your lower leg where it meets the knee.\nIf the results of your physical exam suggest you have a significant knee injury, you will need diagnostic tests to further evaluate your knee. These may include standard X-rays to check for ligament separation from bone or fracture. Tests may also include a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or camera-guided knee surgery (arthroscopy).\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long a knee sprain lasts depends on the type of knee sprain, the severity of your injury, your rehabilitation program and the types of sports you play. In general, milder Grade I and Grade II MCL or LCL sprains heal within 2 to 4 weeks, but other types of knee sprains may take 4 to 12 months.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent sports-related knee injuries, you can:\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have a Grade I or Grade II knee sprain, your doctor probably will recommend that you follow theRICErule:\nYour doctor may suggest that you wear a knee brace for a short period of time and that you take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others), to relieve pain and ease swelling. As your knee pain gradually goes away, your doctor will prescribe a rehabilitation program to strengthen the muscles around your knee. This program should help to stabilize your knee joint and prevent you from injuring it again.\nIf you have a Grade III knee sprain or if multiple ligaments are injured, treatment depends on the specific type of sprain:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you injure your knee, call your doctor to request an urgent evaluation if the knee:\n",
      "Prognosis": "About 90% of people with ACL injuries and 80% with PCL injuries can expect a full recovery after proper treatment and a good physical therapy program. Almost all MCL sprains and most LCL sprains have an excellent prognosis.\nAs a long-term complication, some people with ACL or PCL sprains eventually develop pain from osteoarthritis in the injured knee joint. This symptom may not start until many years after the initial knee injury.\n",

      "What is it?": "Lactose intolerance is a common cause of abdominal cramping, bloating and loose stools. This condition occurs when the body does not have enough of the intestinal enzyme lactase. The job of lactase is to break down lactose, the main sugar in milk. Once lactose is broken down into simpler forms of sugar, these simple sugars can be absorbed into the bloodstream.\nIn normal digestion, lactose is digested in the small intestine without the release of gas bubbles. When lactose can't be digested well, it passes into the colon. Bacteria in the colon break down some of the lactose, producing hydrogen gas. The remaining lactose also draws water into the colon. The extra gas and water result in symptoms, such as cramping, diarrhea, bloating and flatulence (gas).\nLactose intolerance usually is genetic (inherited). In many people of African or Asian descent, the body begins making less lactase around age 5. As many as 90% of people from some areas of Eastern Asia, 80% of American Indians, 65% of Africans and African-Americans, and 50% of Hispanics have some degree of lactose intolerance. In contrast, most Caucasians (80%) have a gene that preserves the ability to produce lactase into adulthood.\nA rare cause of lactose intolerance is called congenital lactase deficiency. Infants with this condition do not produce any lactase. Unable to digest lactose, the infants have diarrhea from birth. This condition was fatal before the development of lactose-free infant formulas.\nDifficulty digesting lactose also can be caused by several gastrointestinal disorders. Viral or bacterial gastroenteritis and other diseases, such as celiac sprue, can destroy the lactase-producing cells that line the small bowel.\nA condition called bacterial overgrowth, in which the small bowel contains more bacteria than normal, can also cause symptoms of sensitivity to lactose in the diet. In this case, the bacteria break down lactose in the small bowel, releasing gas in the process. The gas can cause bloating, cramping and flatulence, and bacterial overgrowth can also cause diarrhea. In this case, the problem is not caused by a lack of the enzyme lactase.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Common symptoms of lactose intolerance include:\nFlatulence that begins about 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating or drinking foods or drinks containing lactose.\nThe severity of symptoms varies, depending on the amount of lactose an individual can tolerate, the amount of lactose ingested, and the size and fat content of the meal. People who also have irritable bowel syndrome tend to have more severe symptoms from lactose intolerance.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "It's possible you have lactose intolerance if your symptoms improve dramatically when you avoid lactose. A trial period of a lactose-free diet is usually all that is needed to make the diagnosis of lactose intolerance. In some cases, your doctor will want to do tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nOne test to confirm the diagnosis is the lactose breath hydrogen test. The test is painless and noninvasive. You cannot eat food for several hours beforehand.\nYou begin the test by drinking a liquid that contains lactose. Your breath is then sampled for hydrogen over a few hours. Normally, very little hydrogen is detected in your breath. However, if you have lactose intolerance, the bacteria in your colon will break the undigested lactose into hydrogen gas. The gas is absorbed into your bloodstream and then moves through the bloodstream to your lungs and exhaled. You will be diagnosed with lactose tolerance if higher-than-normal hydrogen levels are detected during this test. Bacterial overgrowth can also cause a positive test result, so it may be considered as an alternative explanation if your test is positive.\nAnother test that can be used to diagnose lactose intolerance is the lactose tolerance test. This test is rarely used today. You begin this test by drinking a lactose solution. This test measures blood sugar levels at selected intervals over a few hours to determine your ability to digest lactose. If the lactose is normally digested, it is broken down into glucose, and this elevates your blood sugar level. You will be diagnosed with lactose intolerance if your blood sugar levels do not change during this test, because this shows that the lactose was not digested in the normal way.\nA significant number of people who have symptoms that suggest lactose intolerance will have normal results on diagnostic tests. Similar symptoms (but normal results on the tests) can be caused by fructose, sorbitol or other sugars that are not easily digested in the small intestine. Similar symptoms can also result from irritable bowel syndrome.\n",
      "Expected duration": "People who develop lactose intolerance as a result of gastroenteritis or another insult to digestion can recover completely when the intestinal problem is treated. This may take several weeks to months.\nWhen lactose intolerance is genetic, the condition is permanent. However, people can avoid symptoms by avoiding foods that contain lactose (essentially, dairy products) or by eating them in moderation. In addition, commercially prepared forms of the lactase enzyme are available (for example, Lactaid). These replacement enzymes usually do not relieve the symptoms entirely.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent lactose intolerance.\n",
      "Treatment": "There are two main ways to treat lactose intolerance:\nPeople with lactose intolerance need to read labels of all prepared foods to see if they contain lactose. The highest concentrations are found in milk. Cheeses and Greek yogurt typically have lower amounts of lactose. Some products listed as nondairy, such as powdered coffee creamer and whipped toppings, may contain lactose if they contain ingredients that are derived from milk. When you read food labels, look for words such as whey, curds, milk byproducts, dry milk solids and nonfat dry milk powder. If any of these ingredients are on the label, the product probably contains lactose.\nIf you completely avoid lactose, your symptoms should go away. If they do not, the diagnosis might not be correct. Many people will be able to tolerate a gradual increase in lactose intake if they are careful to monitor their symptoms. Doctors often recommend ice cream for this. It tends to be tolerated better than other foods that contain lactose because of its high fat content. As you gradually increase your lactose levels, be sure that you are eating the proper proportions of fat, protein and other nutrients.\nThere are several commercially available enzyme formulations (tablets and liquids) that can serve as lactase replacements. You can add these to foods that contain lactose to reduce symptoms significantly. However, these products rarely get rid of symptoms completely, and the results vary among people and with different product formulations.\nMany people with lactose intolerance may have a difficult time getting enough calcium in their diet. Also they may have low levels of vitamin D. This increases the risk of osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become thin and fragile.\nTherefore, be sure to consume other calcium rich foods. Most people with lactose intolerance are able to tolerate live culture yogurt, one good source of calcium. Vegetables such as broccoli, Chinese cabbage, collard greens and kale are also excellent sources of calcium. There are fewer good natural food sources of vitamin D. You may need a daily vitamin D supplement.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor to discuss the possibility that you might have lactose intolerance if you develop symptoms after eating dairy products. Although this condition is not dangerous, it can be distressing. There are effective treatments available, so there is no need to suffer.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for people with lactose intolerance is excellent. Symptoms can be alleviated if dairy products are limited or avoided, or if they are eaten along with a dose of commercially prepared lactase enzyme.\n",

      "What is it?": "Strokes can damage brain tissue in the outer part of the brain (the cortex) or deeper structures in the brain underneath the cortex. A stroke in a deep area of the brain (for example, a stroke in the thalamus, the basal ganglia or pons) is called a lacunar stroke. These deeper structures receive their blood flow through a unique set of arteries. Because of the characteristics of these arteries, lacunar strokes happen a little bit differently from other strokes.\nA lacunar stroke occurs when one of the arteries that provide blood to the brain's deep structures is blocked. These arteries are small, and are uniquely vulnerable. Unlike most arteries, which gradually taper to a smaller size, the small arteries of a lacunar stroke branch directly off of a large, high-pressure, heavily muscled main artery. High blood pressure (hypertension) can lead to lacunar strokes because it causes a pounding pulse. Since the arteries don't gradually taper down in their size, high blood pressure can directly damage these arteries. High blood pressure also can cause atherosclerosis, a condition in which fatty deposits (plaques) build up along the walls of blood vessels. When atherosclerosis is present, a clot can form inside of one of these small arteries, blocking blood flow in the artery.\n\nUnlike strokes that damage the cortex, lacunar strokes are only rarely caused by a blood clot (also called a \"thrombus\") that forms elsewhere in the body, such as the neck or heart, and travels through the bloodstream to the brain. After a clot (or any debris) begins to travel through the bloodstream it is called an embolus. It is difficult for an embolus to make its way into the small arteries that can cause a lacunar stroke.\nMany of the deep brain organs that can be injured by a lacunar stroke help to relay communication between the brainstem and the brain cortex, or help to coordinate complicated body movements. In a lacunar stroke, brain cells in a relatively small area (measuring from 3 millimeters to as much as 2 centimeters across) are damaged or killed by lack of oxygen. Such a small area of brain destruction is called a lacune. A lacunar stroke involves only a small area of the brain, but it can cause significant disability.\nLacunar strokes account for about 20% of all strokes in the United States.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of lacunar stroke vary depending on the part of the brain that is deprived of its blood supply. Different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions, such as sensation, movement, sight, speech, balance and coordination.\nSymptoms can include:\nIn a person with prolonged, untreated high blood pressure, multiple lacunar strokes can occur. This can cause additional symptoms to develop, including emotional behavior and dementia.\nThe sudden appearance of one or more of these symptoms is a warning sign that a stroke may be in progress. Sometimes, the small clots that can cause a lacunar stroke interfere with blood flow only for a few minutes. If the clot dissolves before damage is done, then symptoms can begin to improve within minutes and may go away completely. When symptoms go away without treatment and full recovery occurs within 24 hours, the event is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Never decide to wait and see whether stroke symptoms will go away on their own. Get to an emergency room as quickly as possible to get treatment.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history (high blood pressure, heart disease, smoking, high cholesterol and diabetes). He or she will check your vital signs (temperature, pulse, breathing rate and blood pressure) and might order an electrocardiogram (EKG).\nLacunar strokes usually are identified by a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain. An MRI technique known as diffusion weighted imaging is particularly sensitive for identifying very new lacunar strokes.\n",
      "Expected duration": "If your symptoms continue without improvement during the time you are traveling to an emergency center, it is best to assume that your event is a full-blown stroke, not a TIA. If a lacunar stroke is treated early, full recovery is possible. If medicines restore circulation to the brain quickly, symptoms of a lacunar stroke may go away within hours. If blood supply is interrupted for a longer time, brain injury may be more severe, and symptoms may last for many weeks or months, requiring physical rehabilitation. There may be permanent disability.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent lacunar stroke by preventing or controlling the risk factors for stroke – high blood pressure, smoking, heart disease and diabetes. If you have high blood pressure or heart disease, follow your doctor's recommendations for modifying your diet and taking your medication. Exercise regularly, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and avoid foods filled with saturated fats and cholesterol. If you smoke, quit. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar level frequently, follow your diet, and take your insulin or oral diabetes medication as your doctor has prescribed.\nIf you have had a lacunar stroke, your doctor may recommend a daily aspirin or other blood-thinning medication, such as clopidogrel (Plavix). These medicines may reduce your risk, but their benefit has been more obvious for stroke types other than lacunar strokes. If you have never had a stroke of any kind, you might lower your risk for a first stroke if you take a daily aspirin. However, this must be balanced against the risk of bleeding.\n",
      "Treatment": "If doctors are able to provide treatment within three hours after symptoms start, they probably will use with a clot-dissolving medication. Although the blood-thinning medication heparin often is used to treat strokes that affect large arteries, it does not appear to help people with lacunar strokes recover.\nAnother treatment that can be used to treat some strokes is a catheter procedure to remove a blood clot in the brain, called \"thrombectomy.\" Unfortunately, this procedure can't be used to treat lacunar strokes. The arteries involved in a lacunar stroke are too small.\nA person who has had a lacunar stroke usually is hospitalized so that he or she can be observed in case symptoms worsen. A person with a severe stroke may need help with self-care or feeding. In the hospital, an occupational therapist and a physical therapist can help the person to work around a new disability and to regain strength after brain injury. Commonly, hospitalization is followed by a period of residence at a rehabilitation center, where additional intensive therapy may be given. The goal of rehabilitation is to maximize recovery. To prevent future strokes, it is very important for you to control high blood pressure. It helps to take a daily aspirin or other blood-thinning medication (ticlopidine or clopidogrel).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call for emergency treatment immediately whenever the symptoms of lacunar stroke occur, even if these symptoms last only a few minutes. For best results, stroke treatment must occur within three hours of the start of symptoms.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People often begin to recover within hours or days of a lacunar stroke. Lacunar strokes have a better rate of recovery than other strokes that involve larger blood vessels. More than 90 percent of people with a lacunar stroke will recover substantially within the first three months following the stroke.\n",

      "What is laryngitis?": "Laryngitis is an inflammation or infection of the voice box (larynx) and the vocal cords it contains. Laryngitis makes the vocal cords swell, changing the way they vibrate and the sound of the voice. Depending on the degree of swelling, the voice may become mildly hoarse, turn into a croak or whisper or even disappear temporarily.\n\nLaryngitis often occurs along with a viral infection, such as a cold or flu. Hoarseness tends to appear later in the illness, after the sore throat, sneezing, coughing and other symptoms. Bacterial infections of the breathing tubes (bronchitis) or lung (pneumonia) also can infect the larynx and cause laryngitis. And laryngitis can occur when the vocal cords are inflamed by straining the voice, such as when yelling or singing very hard.\n",
      "Symptoms of laryngitis": "Symptoms of laryngitis include:\n",
      "Diagnosing laryngitis": "Doctors examine vocal cords using an instrument with a light and a mirror placed in the back of the throat, which allows the doctor to see the vocal cords reflected in the mirror. Another way to view the vocal cords is with a flexible fiberoptic scope. The doctor passes the scope through the nose into the back of the throat.\nIn either case, if the doctor suspects a bacterial infection, he or she may ask you to cough up some mucous (phlegm, sputum) and have it analyzed in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration of laryngitis": "Laryngitis usually clears up within a few days to a week.\n",
      "Preventing laryngitis": "There is no way to prevent laryngitis caused by an infection. To prevent laryngitis caused by straining the voice, avoid shouting or singing for extended periods.\n",
      "Treating laryngitis": "Viral laryngitis normally does not require medical treatment. Gargle with warm saltwater or use throat lozenges to relieve the sore throat. Breathing in moisturized air may help. You can use a humidifier or shut yourself in the bathroom for a few minutes after letting the shower run on its hottest temperature.\nTo rest your vocal cords, talk as little as possible. Avoid whispering, too, because it strains the voice as much as normal speech. If your doctor determines that a bacterial infection is causing the laryngitis, he or she normally will prescribe antibiotics.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have a persistent fever, difficulty breathing or a cough that produces colored phlegm or blood, contact your doctor. If hoarseness lasts for several weeks after a respiratory infection, or if hoarseness develops without any respiratory infection, check with your doctor to determine whether some other condition of the vocal cords, such as a tumor, may be causing the hoarseness.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Laryngitis caused by a virus or vocal strain usually will disappear in a few days to a week. If the laryngitis is caused by a bacterial infection, the outlook depends on the type of bacteria involved.\n",

      "What is latex allergy?": "A latex allergy is a hypersensitivity to latex, a natural substance made of the milky sap of the rubber tree. Latex allergies arise when the immune system, which normally guards the body against bacteria, viruses, and toxins, also reacts to latex. In any type of allergy, when the immune system reacts against an otherwise harmless substance, the substance is called an allergen.\nWhen the immune system detects the allergen, a type of antibody named immunoglobulin E (IgE) is produced, triggering the release of chemicals within the body. One chemical is histamine. Histamine is partly responsible for the redness, itching, and swelling that can occur in the skin during allergic reactions, and it produces symptoms of hives, rashes, a runny nose, and watery, swollen eyes. Histamine can also lead to breathing difficulties and a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis that can include a sudden drop in blood pressure, an increase in pulse, and tissue swelling.\nLatex is a flexible, elastic, and relatively inexpensive material used in a number of health care and consumer products. Because it forms an effective barrier against infectious organisms, latex is used to make hospital and medical items such as surgical and examination gloves and some parts of anesthetic tubing, ventilation bags, respiratory tubing, and intravenous (IV) lines. In addition, it is used in making countless consumer products, including balloons, condoms, diaphragms, rubber gloves, tennis shoe soles, nipples for baby bottles and pacifiers, toys, rubber hoses, and tires. An estimated 12 million tons of latex are produced each year for commercial and consumer products.\nAs the use of latex products increases, so does the incidence of latex allergies. Latex examination gloves are used routinely when health care workers do procedures or handle body fluids. Because of their exposure to latex, health care workers are at increased risk of developing a hypersensitivity to latex products.\nIn addition to workers whose occupations expose them to latex, people who undergo repeated surgical procedures can develop latex allergies. For example, children born with the birth defect called spina bifida are usually exposed repeatedly to latex products because they need a series of medical and surgical procedures. About 50% of children with spina bifida develop a latex allergy.\nPeople can become sensitized to latex as a result of direct contact with natural rubber products. Inhaling latex particles is a common way for health care workers to become sensitized to latex. Many medical gloves are coated with corn starch to make them easier to pull on and off. Cornstarch absorbs the latex proteins, and then carries them into the air where they can be inhaled.\n",
      "Symptoms of latex allergy": "As with any type of allergy, the first exposure to latex allergens usually does not cause any reaction. However, this first exposure can sensitize the immune system to the allergen, which can cause symptoms after later exposures.\nWhen the sensitivity is to a chemical additive used in manufacturing rubber latex, the reaction typically occurs one to two days after exposure and usually involves a form of contact dermatitis, a rash that resembles poison ivy. The skin is usually red, cracked, and blistered.\nWhen the sensitivity is to one of the latex proteins (called Hevea proteins), more serious symptoms can occur within minutes of exposure. Symptoms include hives, runny nose (allergic rhinitis), and allergic asthma. In rare instances, this type of allergy can cause anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can include a sudden drop in blood pressure, an increase in pulse, difficulty breathing, and tissue swelling. Without prompt and proper treatment, anaphylaxis can lead to unconsciousness and, rarely, death.\n",
      "Diagnosing latex allergy": "Your doctor may suspect that your symptoms are related to a latex sensitivity if you have a history of exposure followed rapidly by the appearance of symptoms. If you have other allergies and allergic conditions, you may be more susceptible to latex allergy. Examples of allergic conditions are asthma, hay fever, or eczema (atopic dermatitis). There also seems to be a link between latex allergies and allergies to certain foods, including avocados, bananas, kiwi, pineapples, tomatoes, and chestnuts.\nAlong with your exposure history, a blood test can measure the amount of latex-associated IgE antibodies in your blood. Skin testing for latex allergy also can be done. In rare cases, challenge tests with latex products are used to confirm the diagnosis. In a challenge test, you stay away from the suspected allergen for a period of time, then are exposed to the substance (in a medically monitored setting) to see if you develop symptoms.\n",
      "Preventing latex allergy": "The best way to prevent any type of allergy is to avoid exposure. With latex allergies, that means using gloves not made of latex for dishwashing or other chores, refraining from blowing up balloons, avoiding rubber bands, and using condoms made of materials other than latex. You also should tell your health care providers so that they can avoid exposing you to products that contain latex. But if you work in the health care field, avoiding latex can be difficult because so many medical products contain latex. Although you may not be able to avoid latex completely, you may be able to limit the use of latex products and find products that are less irritating.\nThe amount of latex allergens shed by different types of gloves, for example, varies tremendously. Some contain less of the chemical additives that have been shown to cause skin sensitivity. A number of successful lawsuits involving latex reactions have prompted many manufacturers to change the way they make latex products. Because latex gloves that are powdered with corn starch appear to cause the most problems, using gloves that are not powdered may help to prevent reactions.\n",
      "Treating latex allergy": "The most important treatment for occupational latex allergies is to avoid repeat exposures, because repeated exposures can increase sensitivity. People with latex allergy may need to be reassigned to different work duties or even to change occupations.\nOnce you have a reaction to latex, treatment depends on the type and severity of your reaction. An antihistamine can block the actions of histamine, so an antihistamine can decrease itching and swelling. Corticosteroid drugs, which are powerful anti-inflammatory agents, are used for more severe symptoms. These are available as tablets, nasal or bronchial sprays, or topical creams. Although corticosteroid medications can be very effective against allergic reactions, they can produce serious side effects when used in high dosages or over long periods of time. Your and your doctor will weigh the benefits against the risks of side effects, using corticosteroids in the lowest dose that works for you if you need them.\nAnaphylaxis, the most serious allergic reaction, can cause blood vessels to dilate and air passages of the lungs to narrow, leading to wheezing, breathing difficulties, and a drop in blood pressure. In the most severe cases, loss of consciousness and death can occur. Anaphylaxis requires an emergency injection of epinephrine (adrenaline) and treatment with intravenous fluids.\nIf you have a latex allergy, consider wearing an allergy alert bracelet and carrying an emergency epinephrine kit.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you suspect a latex allergy, you need a medical evaluation.\nIf you experience difficulty breathing, a rapid pulse, facial swelling or dizziness, contact your doctor or go to an emergency room at once. These symptoms could signal anaphylaxis, which requires emergency treatment.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With prompt, appropriate treatment, most people recover completely from an allergic reaction to latex. In rare cases, an allergic reaction to latex can be severe, leading to anaphylaxis and death. If latex is strictly avoided, the allergy reaction will not occur.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, is an eye problem that can occur in growing children. In the typical child with lazy eye, the right and left eyes have significantly different qualities of vision, so that the images produced by one eye are weak or distorted compared with the images produced by the other eye. Because the weak eye sends poorly focused images to the brain, the brain learns to depend on the stronger eye for its visual information. If this situation is not corrected, the brain eventually chooses to accept images from the stronger eye alone and ignores images from the weak one. In other words, the weak eye doesn't learn to see.\nTo continue reading this article, you mustlog in.\nSubscribe to Harvard Health Online for immediate access to health news and information from Harvard Medical School.\nI'd like to receive access to Harvard Health Online for only $4.99 a month.\nAlready a member?Login ».\n",

      "What is it?": "Whenever a bone breaks or cracks, the injury is called a fracture. The leg has three bones that can fracture: the femur (the thighbone) and the tibia and fibula in the lower leg. When a fracture involves the knobby end portions of bones that are part of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, the fracture is more complicated. This article describes only fractures of the straight shafts of the three long leg bones.\n",
      "Femur fractures": "In most cases, doctors prefer to repair the fracture surgically. Surgical repair usually requires a shorter hospital stay and creates less disability than other treatment methods such as wearing a plaster cast that covers the entire leg and hip.\nTo repair your fracture, the surgeon will join the segments of your broken femur using a special metal rod that is inserted into the bone's inner cavity. This rod will stabilize and reinforce the fracture site, allowing the femur to heal quickly and firmly. Once healing is complete, the metal rod may be removed or left in place.\nAfter surgery, you will need to use crutches to avoid bearing weight on the leg, followed by a program of physical therapy. The goal of physical therapy is to restore normal strength in your leg muscles and normal range of motion in your leg joints. The entire process of healing and rehabilitation usually takes months.\n",
      "Tibia fractures": "Treatment depends on the severity and location of your tibia fracture. If you have an uncomplicated fracture that is not near your knee or ankle, the doctor may be able to treat your injury by immobilizing your leg in a cast. More severe fractures usually have to be repaired surgically with a metal rod, wires, or plates and screws.\n",
      "Fibula fractures": "In general, a fibula fracture that occurs without a tibia fracture can be treated without surgery or hospitalization. Your doctor probably will tell you to rest the injured leg, apply ice to the injured area, and take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others), to ease pain and relieve swelling. If bearing weight on your injured leg is very painful or if the fracture is near the ankle, your doctor may apply a cast and recommend that you use crutches temporarily.\nFor any of these fractures, if your fracture breaks the skin the condition is more serious: debridement (removal of foreign material or damaged tissue from the wound), surgery, and intravenous antibiotics are usually recommended. If you have not had a tetanus shot within the past 10 years, a tetanus vaccination will also be recommended.\nOnce your fracture has healed enough, your doctor will prescribe a program of physical therapy to restore full strength and function in your injured leg.\n",
      "Symptoms": "If you have fractured the shaft of your femur, your symptoms may include:\nIf you have fractured the shaft of your tibia, or both your tibia and fibula, you may see:\nA fibula fracture that occurs alone usually causes:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will examine your injured leg, checking for swelling, deformity, abrasions, bruising, and tenderness. To help determine whether a sharp edge of broken bone has damaged your leg's blood vessels or nerves, the doctor also will feel the pulses along the length of your injured leg, will assess how you respond to touch, and will check for normal muscle strength in your leg and foot. If the physical examination suggests that your leg's arteries or large veins may have been injured, the doctor may order an ultrasound or other specialized tests to measure the leg's blood flow more precisely.\nYour leg will be x-rayed to confirm the location and severity of your fracture, and to check for less-obvious fractures and dislocations in nearby joints.\n",
      "Expected duration": "A leg fracture may take two or more months to heal depending on whether surgery is necessary, whether there were multiple fragments, and whether there were complications such as infection.\n",
      "Prevention": "The best way to avoid fractures is to prevent accidents. Supervise children and encourage safe play. Drive carefully and always wear a seat belt. For information about how to prevent work-related injuries in construction and other occupations, visit the website of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Prevention of osteoporosis can reduce the risk of related fractures.\n",
      "Treatment": "",
      "When to call a professional": "Seek emergency help if you have significant lasting pain and suspect you may have a leg fracture after a fall, a motor vehicle accident, or other trauma involving the leg.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for leg fractures varies, depending on the type of fracture and its severity:\n",

      "What is it?": "A muscle strain is a stretch or tear of muscle fibers. In the leg, muscle strains happen when a muscle is either stretched beyond its limits or forced into extreme contraction. Because the leg has many different muscles, it is vulnerable to several different types of muscle strains. Some of the more common ones are:\nTo help simplify diagnosis and treatment, doctors often classify muscle strains into three different grades, depending on the severity of muscle fiber damage.\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a strained leg muscle can include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will want to know what activity triggered your leg pain and whether there was a pop in the muscle when you injured it. The doctor also will ask about your symptoms, especially any decreased muscle strength or difficulty walking.\nTo confirm a diagnosis, the doctor will examine you. If the results of your exam point to Grade I or II muscle strain, you probably will not need any additional testing. However, if the diagnosis is in doubt, X-rays or a magnetic resonance imaging scan may be necessary. Also, in calf muscle injuries, Doppler studies may be done to check for a blood clot.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Most Grade I or Grade II strains begin to feel better within a few days. In most cases, symptoms are either totally gone, or very much improved, within 8 to 10 weeks. Symptoms of a Grade III strain may last until the torn muscle is repaired surgically.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent muscle strains in your legs, you can\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have a Grade I or Grade II strain, your doctor will probably recommend that you follow the RICE rule:\nIn addition, you can take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and other brand names) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, and others), to ease pain and relieve swelling. As pain gradually subsides, your doctor may recommend a rehabilitation program to restore the normal range of motion in your leg and to gradually strengthen the injured muscle.\nIf you have a Grade II strain, you may need to be evaluated by a specialist, such as an orthopedist. To allow the injured muscle to heal, you may need to wear a brace or cast for a number of weeks.\nIf you have a Grade III strain in your leg, the torn muscle may need to be repaired surgically by an orthopedic specialist. One exception is a Grade III plantaris strain, which usually is treated without surgery.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly if\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the location and severity of the muscle strain. In general, almost all Grade I strains heal within a few weeks. Grade II strains may take two to three months. After surgery to repair a Grade III strain, most people regain normal leg muscle function after several months of rehabilitation.\n",

      "What is it?": "Liver cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the liver. It is also called hepatoma or hepatocellular carcinoma.\nThe liver:\nMost liver tumors in the United States spread to the liver from other places in the body. This is referred to as secondary liver cancer or metastatic cancer. For example, cancer that has spread to the liver from the lungs is called metastatic lung cancer.\nThe liver is the most common place for cancer to spread. In patients with secondary liver cancer, doctors treat patients at the original site of the cancer. So, metastatic lung cancer that has spread to the liver would be treated as lung cancer, not liver cancer.\nOn the other hand, primary liver cancer starts in the liver, as opposed to a cancer that originates in another part of the body and spreads to the liver. Primary liver cancer is treated as liver cancer.\n\n",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that increase your risk of developing primary liver cancer include:\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms usually do not appear until the disease is advanced. Symptoms can include:\nLiver cancer can lead to high pressure in blood vessels that feed into the liver. This can cause veins in the esophagus and stomach to swell with significant risk of bleeding and vomiting blood.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Liver cancer is usually diagnosed in later stages of the disease because symptoms do not appear until then.\nOnce your doctor suspects you might have liver cancer, he or she will use one or more of the following methods to diagnose the disease:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Without treatment, liver cancer will continue to grow.\n",
      "Prevention": "Most primary liver cancer can be prevented. Here are some things you can do.\nTo minimize the risk of being infected with a hepatitis virus:\nOther healthy lifestyle choices may also decrease your risk of developing liver cancer:\nTreating chronic hepatitis B or C with antiviral drugs helps prevent cirrhosis and decreases the chance of developing primary liver cancer.\n",
      "Treatment": "The type of treatment depends on a number of factors, including the stage of the cancer, your age and your general health. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are potential treatment options. Often, a combination of all three is used.\nA primary liver cancer that has not spread to lymph nodes or other organs can often be surgically removed. However, only a small percentage of liver cancers are found in this early stage.\nFor most cases of liver cancer, it is not possible to remove the entire tumor, or the cancer has spread throughout much of the liver or to distant sites. There are no standard treatments for liver cancer in these stages. In a few cases, a liver transplant may be considered.\nNewer therapies have improved the outlook for some patients with liver cancer. For example, in some cases of primary liver cancer, targeted therapies can be used. These drugs block the chemical pathways that stimulate growth and spread of cancer cells.\nOther drugs, which decrease the blood supply that tumors need to grow, have also been shown to be helpful. In some cases, chemotherapy can be delivered directly into blood vessels that feed the tumor. Or materials can be injected into blood vessels that act as a clot and shut off the blood supply to the liver. Without blood supply, the tumor shrinks.\nIn many cases, liver cancer cannot be cured. Instead, treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms of the cancer or keeping the cancer from growing, spreading, or returning.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Most symptoms of liver cancer are not specific, such as fatigue, decreased appetite, and weight loss. Liver problems of any kind, including liver cancer, also may cause:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for people with liver cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread and whether it can be entirely removed with surgery.\n",

      "What is it?": "Long QT syndrome is an uncommon inherited condition— meaning it's caused by genes passed on to you from your parents. The electrical activity of heart cells is controlled by a set of channels that pump minerals, such as sodium and potassium, in and out of cells. If you inherit genes that cause alterations in these channels, it can affect the action of heart cells.\nNormally, an electrical impulse starts in the sinus node, located in the upper chamber of the heart. The electrical impulse then travels down to the lower chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, causing contraction of the ventricles' muscle cells. This contraction causes the blood to flow out of your heart, like how squeezing a balloon filled with water, but not tied at the top, causes the water to squirt out the top.\nThe heart muscle cells then relax. During this relaxation phase, the electrical charges of the cells need to recover.\nThere are normal amounts of times for each of these phases of the heartbeat, called intervals. A test called an electrocardiogram (EKG) can show how long it takes for the impulse to pass through certain sections of the heart, and how long it takes for the heart muscle cells in the ventricles to recover. The recovery time is known as the QT interval.\nThe QT interval lasts just a fraction of a second; it normally lasts about one-third of an entire heartbeat. In people with long QT syndrome, the interval lasts longer than it should because heart muscle cells are having trouble getting ready for the next contraction.\nA prolonged QT interval does not cause symptoms. However, the delay in recharging upsets the electrical timing of the heart. This makes the heart more likely to develop abnormal heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. Sometimes these arrhythmias can be dangerous, even deadly.\nPeople with long QT syndrome may not always show an abnormally long QT interval on an EKG. Many different factors can influence the recovery time of even normal heart cells. Sometimes long QT intervals only occur during exercise, at times of intense emotion, or after being startled.\nInherited long QT syndrome is not nearly as common as a prolonged QT interval caused by a medication or an imbalance of certain minerals in the blood stream. Many medications are known to lengthen the QT interval and upset the heart rhythm.\nThe two best understood inherited long QT syndromes are the Romano-Ward syndrome and the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. Of the two, the Romano-Ward syndrome is more common. It is an autosomal dominant inherited condition — meaning you can have a long QT if you inherit one abnormal gene from either parent. The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is rare. People with this syndrome have a very long QT interval and are also deaf. The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherited condition — meaning that you need to inherit two abnormal genes, one from each parent, to get this syndrome.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In most people, a prolonged QT interval does not cause any symptoms. The concern is that it can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), which may be life threatening. Arrhythmias can also cause fainting and shortness of breath.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The diagnosis is usually made after you've had a standard EKG that shows a long QT interval. Your doctor might order this test if you have a family history of long QT syndrome or a family history of sudden death. The prolonged QT may also be identified when a person has an EKG for some other, unrelated reason.\nSince long QT syndrome does not always create longer than normal QT intervals all the time, there's a chance your EKG may be normal even though you have prolonged QT intervals at other times. If your doctor suspects this is the case, you may be asked to wear a Holter monitor.\nLike an EKG, a Holter monitor records the electrical signals of your heart. The device is small, portable and can fit in your pocket. A technician will apply electrodes to the skin on your chest and attach them to wires connected to the monitor. You wear the monitor for 24 or 48 hours, as you go about your normal activities. You also keep a diary noting when you have symptoms.\nSince some people only have long QT intervals when they exercise, you might be asked to walk or run on a treadmill while hooked up to an EKG machine. This is often called a stress test. If you can't exercise, you may get an injection of medicine that makes your heart work hard and beat fast, as if you were exercising.\nYour doctor will also examine you and ask about any medications you take, including over-the-counter medications, herbs and supplements, and illegal drugs. He or she will look for signs of conditions that can lower blood levels of potassium and magnesium, such as the eating disorders anorexia nervosa and bulimia, excess vomiting or diarrhea, and certain thyroid disorders.\nGenetic testing for long QT syndrome may be recommended in certain situations, for example if many people in your family have it. The genetic test is simple to have done—it just involves giving a blood sample.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Inherited long QT syndrome does not go away. If you have a long QT interval caused by a medication you are taking or by a mineral imbalance, it will most likely go away once you stop taking the medication or treat the imbalance. Note that if one type of medication causes you to have a prolonged QT, other medications that affect the QT interval will likely affect you in the same way. Ask your doctor about this any time you are starting a new medication.\n",
      "Prevention": "There's no way to prevent inherited long QT syndrome. However, people with the inherited syndrome want to avoid taking medications that can make the QT even longer than it is naturally. Eating enough food and a balanced diet can prevent mineral imbalances that may lengthen the QT interval.\nEveryone starting a new medication should check with a pharmacist or doctor about potential interactions with current medications. This includes people who don't have any history of long QT intervals. Some drug combinations can significantly prolong the QT interval, which would increase the risk of an arrhythmia.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment for people with inherited long QT syndrome generally doesn't shorten the length of the QT interval. But it can greatly reduce the risk of life-threatening abnormal heartbeats and fainting spells. Most people with inherited long QT syndrome take beta blockers, which prevent the heart from beating fast during exercise or stressful events.\nIf your symptoms occur when you exercise or are under stress, it is best to avoid very strenuous exercise and keep stress at bay. Breathing exercises, meditation, and yoga are all ways to help manage stress. Your doctor may also suggest you eat foods high in potassium, such as bananas, or take potassium supplements.\nIf you've fainted or developed dangerous heart rhythms because of long QT syndrome, then you are at higher risk for having serious complications from the syndrome. Your doctor may suggest that you have surgery to implant a pacemaker or implanted cardioverter defibrillator in your chest. These devices monitor the heart rhythm and deliver electrical currents to the heart when they detect an abnormal heart rhythm.\nAnother surgical option is to have a procedure where the nerves that prompt the heart to beat faster in response to physical or emotional stress are cut. After the surgery, you are much less likely to develop dangerous heart rhythms in response to stress or exercise.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you experience fainting, arrhythmias, or unexplained shortness of breath.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The scary thing about long QT syndrome is that it can cause sudden death in otherwise healthy people. But people who are discovered to have a long QT interval can significantly decrease their risk of an arrhythmia by avoiding things that could make the QT interval longer, such as stress and strenuous exercise. Ask your doctor for advice on how much and what types of exercise are best for you.\nMedications, such as beta blockers, and surgical implantation of a pacemaker-defibrillator can greatly improve the prognosis.\n",

      "What is it?": "One of the most common cancers, lung cancer usually occurs when a cancer-causing agent, or carcinogen, triggers the growth of abnormal cells in the lung. These cells multiply out of control and eventually form a tumor. As the tumor grows, it destroys nearby areas of the lung. Eventually, tumor cells can spread (metastasize) to nearby lymph nodes and other parts of the body. These include the\nIn most cases, the carcinogens that trigger lung cancer are chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, relatively more lung cancers are being diagnosed in people who have never smoked. But this still accounts for a minority of new cases.\nLung cancers are divided into two groups, based on how their cells look under the microscope: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Knowing whether the cancer has spread is critical, because it affects treatment decisions.\nNon-small cell lung cancer may be localized. Localized lung cancer is limited to the lung and has not spread. It may be treated with surgery. Small cell lung cancer is rarely localized, even when it is detected early. It is rarely treated with surgery.\nHowever, even when doctors think that the cancer is localized, it often comes back after surgery. It can come back either in the location where it first started. Or it can recur in another part of the body. This usually means cancer cells had started to spread before surgery, but they couldn't yet be detected.\n",
      "Non-small cell lung cancer": "Surgery is the main treatment for non-small cell lung cancers that have not spread beyond the chest. The type of surgery will depend on the extent of the cancer. It will also depend on whether other lung conditions, such as emphysema, are present.\nThere are three types of surgery:\nLymph nodes are also removed and examined to see if the cancer has spread.\nSome surgeons use video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) to remove small, early-stage tumors, especially if the tumors are near the outer edge of the lung. (VATS can also be used to diagnose lung cancer.) Because the incisions for VATS are small, this technique is less invasive than a traditional \"open\" procedure.\nBecause surgery will remove part or all of a lung, breathing may be more difficult afterwards, especially in patients with other lung conditions (emphysema, for example). Doctors can test lung function prior to surgery and predict how it might be affected by surgery.\nGenetic testing of the tumor evaluates whether there are mutations that cause the cancer to grow and spread. If present, specific drugs are now available to treat these mutations and have provided encouraging results in some patients.\nDepending on how far the cancer has spread, treatment may include chemotherapy (the use of anticancer drugs) and radiation therapy. These may be given before and/or after surgery.\nWhen the tumor has spread significantly, chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy may be recommended to slow its growth, even if it cannot cure the disease. These therapies have been shown to ease symptoms and prolong life in cases of advanced lung cancer.\nRadiation therapy can relieve symptoms, too. It is often used to treat lung cancer that has spread to the brain or bones and is causing pain. It can also be used alone or with other therapies to treat the lung cancer that is confined to the chest.\nPeople who may not withstand surgery due to other serious medical problems may receive radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy, as an alternative to surgery. Advances in radiation have made it possible for prolonged survival in some people, with results similar to surgery.\nKnowing about specific genetic mutations can help predict which therapy will be best. This strategy can be especially helpful in certain patients, such as women with adenocarcinoma of the lung who have never smoked.\n",
      "Small cell lung cancer": "The treatment of small cell lung cancer depends on its stage:\n",
      "Lung cancer risk factors": "Your risk of all types of lung cancer increase if you\n",
      "Symptoms": "In some cases, lung cancer is detected when a person with no symptoms has a chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan for another reason. But most people with lung cancer have one or more of these symptoms:\nIf the cancer has spread beyond the lungs, it can cause other symptoms. For example, you may have bone pain if it has spread to your bones.\nCertain small cell lung cancers may secrete chemicals that can alter the body's chemical composition. For example, levels of sodium and calcium may be abnormal. This can lead to the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.\nMany of these symptoms can be caused by other conditions. See your doctor if you have symptoms so that the problem can be diagnosed and properly treated.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may suspect lung cancer based on\nTo look for evidence of cancer, your doctor will examine you, paying special attention to your lungs and chest. He or she will order imaging tests to check your lungs for masses. In most cases, a chest x-ray will be done first. If the x-ray shows anything suspicious, a CT scan will be done. As the scanner moves around you, it takes many pictures. A computer then combines the images. This creates a more detailed image of the lungs, allowing doctors to confirm the size and location of a mass or tumor.\nYou may also have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. MRI scans provide detailed pictures of the body's organs, but they use radio waves and magnets to create the images, not x-rays. PET scans look at the function of tissue rather than anatomy. Lung cancer tends to show intense metabolic activity on a PET scan. Some medical centers offer combined PET-CT scanning.\nIf cancer is suspected based on these images, more tests will be done to make the diagnosis, determine the type of cancer, and see if it has spread. These tests may include the following:\nBiopsy. A sample of abnormal lung tissue is removed and examined under a microscope in a laboratory. If the tissue contains cancer cells, the type of cancer can be determined by the way the cells look under the microscope. The tissue is often obtained during a bronchoscopy. However, surgery may be necessary to expose the suspicious area.\n\nAfter the cancer has been diagnosed, it is assigned a \"stage.\" The stages differ for non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer.\n",
      "Non-small cell lung cancer stages": "Stages of non-small cell lung cancer reflect the tumor's size and how far the cancer has spread. Stages I through III are further divided into A and B categories.\n",
      "Small cell lung cancer stages": "Many experts divide small cell lung cancers into two groups:\nKnowing the type of cancer and its stage helps doctors determine the best treatment.

      "What is Lyme disease?": "Lyme disease is an infection caused by bacteria calledBorrelia burgdorferi. These bacteria are transmitted through the bites of ticks, primarily the deer tick. Not everyone who develops symptoms of Lyme disease remembers getting bitten by a tick because the deer tick is very small and its bite can go unnoticed.\n\nLyme disease is most common in the Northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and upper Midwestern United States. About 90% of US cases have been reported in 14 states: Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Even within states, there are regions of high risk and others with very low rates of disease. This variation relates to where ticks that carry the bacteria live, breed, and come into contact with humans.\nLate spring and early summer are the peak times of the year for Lyme disease to be diagnosed. However, the condition is not always diagnosed right away. So, cases still are identified all year long.\nDeer ticks can carry other germs, such asAnaplasma,Babesia, andBorrelia miyamotoi.It's not uncommon for people to have one of these infections in addition to Lyme disease.\n",
      "Symptoms of Lyme disease": "The most common initial symptom is a rash called erythema migrans (EM), which is typically a flat, reddish rash that spreads from the site of the tick bite. The rash is often larger than two inches wide and can grow even larger with a central clear area known as a bull's eye. The rash usually doesn't itch or hurt. In many cases, the rash is less classic (for example, without the central clearing) and in about a third of cases a person with Lyme disease recalls no rash at all.\nOther symptoms at this stage can include fever, muscle and joint aches, fatigue, headache, and a stiff neck. In some cases, there are two or more of these well-defined rashes.\n\nOver several days to weeks after the tick bite, Lyme disease can cause other problems. It can affect the nervous system. For example, it can cause Bell's palsy, a condition in which the nerve that controls most of the facial muscles becomes inflamed and the muscles get weak. The infection can get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, causing a type of meningitis.\nLyme disease also can affect the heart. The most common problem is a very slow heartbeat that leads to fatigue, dizziness, and fainting. The heart muscle can also be inflamed, called myocarditis.\nIn later stages of Lyme disease, pain and swelling of joints may develop. The arthritis commonly affects one knee, or causes episodes of swelling in several joints, called migratory arthritis. The symptoms can become persistent. Neurologic disease, causing problems with memory and concentration, can also develop as a late manifestation of Lyme disease.\n",
      "Diagnosing Lyme disease": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and perform a complete physical and neurological examination. If you have had a recent tick bite and have saved the tick, your doctor may want to inspect the insect and send it to a laboratory to identify the species. Some laboratories can analyze the tick to see if it's carrying Lyme bacteria.\nYour doctor will diagnose Lyme disease based on your symptoms, physical examination, and, in many cases, blood tests. However, blood tests are often negative in the first few weeks of Lyme disease. The basic Lyme test is called an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). It is far from perfect: besides being negative in early disease, it may be positive in someone who doesn't have the illness (a false-positive result). Therefore, every positive or uncertain Lyme ELISA result needs to be confirmed with a test called a Western blot, which looks for more specific evidence of Lyme disease infection.\nA positive Lyme blood test, even including a Western blot, doesn't mean that the disease is active and needs to be treated. This is because blood tests can remain positive for years, even after Lyme disease has been treated or has become inactive. To help diagnose Lyme disease and to check for other causes of symptoms, a sample of fluid may be withdrawn from an affected joint using a sterile needle. Cerebrospinal fluid also may be taken from around the spinal cord through a spinal tap (lumbar puncture), to test for Lyme disease antibodies and inflammation and check for other diseases.\n",
      "Expected duration of Lyme disease": "People often recover within two to six weeks without antibiotics. Even Lyme arthritis can improve on its own as the body's immune system attacks the infection, although it's common for the joint symptoms to return. Antibiotic therapy is highly effective at curing the illness. Significant improvement typically occurs within two to six weeks after beginning therapy.\n",
      "Preventing Lyme disease": "If you are in a region where Lyme disease is more common, you can:\nAntibiotics are not prescribed for every tick bite because the risk of getting Lyme disease is quite low, ranging from less than 0.1% in most areas to 5% in some areas of the Northeast and Midwest. In addition, risk is lower if the tick has been attached for less than 36 hours. If a tick is engorged, it’s more likely to have been attached long enough to transmit Lyme disease.\nA single dose of doxycycline can usually prevent disease if taken within three days of a tick bite. So for those at highest risk, early antibiotic treatment may be appropriate. A Lyme disease vaccine is not currently available for humans.\n",
      "Treating Lyme disease": "For the early Lyme EM rash, doctors usually prescribe oral antibiotics for 10 to 14 days. Doxycycline is the preferred treatment. Alternative antibiotics include amoxicillin, azithromycin, and cefuroxime (Ceftin, others). Similar treatment is usually recommended for people who have developed neurologic disease (such as Bell's palsy), arthritis, or carditis, although sometimes antibiotic treatment will be extended to three weeks.\nSome people with heart or neurological problems will be treated with antibiotics such as ceftriaxone (Rocephin) given intravenously (into a vein) for two to four weeks. Intravenous treatment also may be recommended if a person with Lyme arthritis does not respond to oral antibiotics. Doxycycline should be avoided in children under 8 years old and for women who are pregnant or nursing. Azithromycin or clarithromycin may be less effective, but are often prescribed for people with Lyme disease who are allergic to doxycycline or can't tolerate the other options mentioned above.\nSome people with heart inflammation due to Lyme disease require a temporary pacemaker; however, because antibiotic treatment is usually effective, a permanent pacemaker is rarely needed.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you develop a rash or flulike illness after you have been bitten by a tick, or if you could have been exposed to ticks. You should also call your doctor if you have facial paralysis, arthritis, or persistent dizziness or heart palpitations.\nIf you are taking oral antibiotics for Lyme disease and your symptoms do not improve within two to three weeks, call your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People with the Lyme disease rash rarely have problems after they are treated with antibiotics. In some cases, people become extremely tired after being treated for Lyme disease, but this problem doesn't tend to improve with additional antibiotics. The medical reason for this fatigue is uncertain. Many (and perhaps most) people with persistent symptoms have no clear evidence of active infection. Intensive antibiotic treatment (for example, intravenous treatment for prolonged periods) usually doesn't help.\nUp to 10% of people with Lyme arthritis appear to have chronic (long-lasting) joint swelling despite taking antibiotics. This may be due to an autoimmune effect, in which Lyme infection triggers the immune system to attack the body's own cells. This problem seems to follow Lyme disease primarily in people of certain genetic types. These people may respond to medications that suppress the immune system (similar to those used in rheumatoid arthritis) rather than to continued antibiotics.\n",

      "What is lymphedema?": "Lymphedema is the buildup of fluid called lymph in the tissues under your skin when something blocks its normal flow. This causes swelling, most commonly in an arm or leg.\nLymph normally does an important job for your body. It carries foreign material and bacteria away from your skin and body tissues, and it circulates infection-fighting cells that are part of your immune system.\nLymph flows slowly through the network of vessels called your lymphatic system. Lymph flow stops at points along the way to be filtered through lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped organs that are part of your immune system.\nLymph is formed from the fluid that surrounds cells in the body. It makes its way into very small lymphatic vessels. After traveling through these small vessels, lymph drains into deeper, wider lymph channels that run through the body. Eventually, lymph fluid returns to the blood.\nLymphedema occurs when there is inadequate lymph drainage from the body, usually from a blockage in a lymph channel. Lymphatic fluid builds up underneath the skin and causes swelling. Most commonly lymphedema affects the arms or legs.\nSwelling from lymphedema can look similar to the more common edema caused by leakage from tiny blood vessels under the skin.\nIn most cases of lymphedema, the lymphatic system has been injured so that the flow of lymph is blocked either temporarily or permanently. This is called secondary lymphedema. Common causes include:\nWhen lymphedema occurs without any known injury or infection, it is called primary lymphedema. Doctors diagnose three types of primary lymphedema according to when symptoms first appear:\nAll three types of primary lymphedema are probably related to the abnormal development of lymph channels before birth. The difference is when in life they first cause swelling of the legs or arms.\n",
      "Symptoms of lymphedema": "Lymphedema causes swelling with a feeling of heaviness, tightness or fullness, usually in an arm or leg. In most cases, only one arm or leg is affected. Swelling in the leg usually begins at the foot, and then moves up if it worsens to include the ankle, calf and knee. Additional symptoms can include:\nLymphedema can make it easier to develop a skin infection. Signs of infection include fever, pain, heat and redness. If lymphedema becomes chronic (long lasting), the skin in the affected area often becomes thickened and hard.\n",
      "Diagnosing lymphedema": "Your doctor will ask you whether you have had any surgery, radiation treatments, or infections in the affected area. The doctor may ask if you have ever had a blood clot. If a child has lymphedema, the doctor will ask if anyone in your family had leg swelling starting at a young age. This may indicate an inherited disorder.\nYour doctor will examine the swollen area and press on the affected skin to look for a fingertip indentation (pitting). The skin will be indented in people with the much more common type of edema caused by leaky blood vessels. Pitting does not happen when you press on skin if you have lymphedema.\nYour doctor may measure the circumference of the affected arm or leg to determine how swollen it is compared to the other one. The doctor will look for signs of infection, including fever, redness, warmth, and tenderness.\nUsually, no specific testing is necessary to diagnose lymphedema. But tests may be ordered if the diagnosis is not clear or there is no obvious cause for your condition:\n",
      "Expected duration of lymphedema": "How long lymphedema lasts depends on its cause. If lymphedema develops immediately after surgery, it can clear up within one week as the swelling goes down and the arm or leg is elevated to allow better drainage. If surgery or radiation therapy produced long-term damage to the lymphatic system, lymphedema can become a long-term or recurring problem.\n",
      "Preventing lymphedema": "After breast cancer or prostate cancer surgery, your doctor or physical therapist may advise that you do specific exercises once you have fully recovered from the surgery. Using your muscles can encourage the flow of lymph through small channels.\nAfter breast surgery, you are less likely to develop lymphedema if you can avoid having injections, intravenous (IV) lines, or blood drawn in the arm on the side of the surgery. Also, be sure to get prompt treatment if you think you may have a skin infection on the side of your surgery.\nOther ways to help decrease the risk of secondary lymphedema include:\n",
      "Treating lymphedema": "The basic treatment for lymphedema includes:\nIf lymphedema affects your legs, avoid wearing socks with tight bands across the top. Avoid standing for long periods. If you work on your feet or at a desk all day, your doctor may prescribe special compression stockings for you to wear throughout the day. Your doctor may suggest that you follow a protein-rich, low-salt diet.\nFor people with more severe lymphedema, doctors prescribe inflatable sleeves that can be worn around the arm or leg, called pneumatic compression devices. These sleeves are attached to a machine that alternately fills and deflates them with air, and they can be used at home to help reduce limb swelling. An alternative to air-filled sleeves is to wrap the limb with a non-elastic bandage, and adjust the bandage each time the swelling decreases.\nA very helpful treatment is a type of massage therapy called manual lymph drainage. Massage should not be done if you have cancer in the limb.\nSurgery may be an option for some people with lymphedema. Several different procedures are available. Some aim to restore lymphatic circulation. In other cases, the goal is to remove excess fat that has been deposited as a result of the lymphedema.\nPeople with lymphedema are more prone to infection in the affected arm or leg. If your doctor suspects you have an infection, you will need to take antibiotics by mouth or into a vein (intravenously).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment with your doctor if you develop symptoms of lymphedema in an arm or leg.\nYou should call your doctor the same day if you have symptoms that could be from an infection:\n",
      "Prognosis": "It isn't always easy to predict whether edema will last. Most of the time, treatments can improve lymphedema symptoms.\n",

      "What is lymphoma?": "Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymph (or lymphatic) system. It is part of the immune system. It collects and destroys invading organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, and abnormal cells. It protects the body from infection and disease.\nThe lymph system is a network of tissue, vessels, and fluid (lymph). It includes:\nLymph tissue also resides in the spleen, thymus gland, tonsils, bone marrow, and digestive system.\nLymphatic tissue is composed mainly of lymphocytes. There are two main types of lymphocytes:\nLymphoma starts when a lymphocyte changes into an abnormal cell that begins dividing out of control. These abnormal cells often form masses (tumors) in lymph nodes and elsewhere. Because lymph tissue is located throughout the body, lymphoma can begin almost anywhere. It can spread to almost any tissue or organ.\nThe two main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin disease (Hodgkin lymphoma) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are about 30 different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHodgkin disease can affect lymph tissue anywhere in the body. It can also spread from lymph tissue to other organs. Hodgkin disease usually affects people in their late 20s or older than 50. Males get the disease more often than females. Whites are affected more often than people of other races.\nMost lymphoma is non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In adults, non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects males more than females. It often occurs between the ages of 60 and 70. Whites are affected more often than people of other races.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma has become more common in the past few decades. This may be related to the rise in the number of people who have a suppressed immune system, such as people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and those who have had an organ transplant and need to take drugs that alter the immune system.\nAge is a major determinant of the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Slow-growing lymphomas (low-grade) are more likely to occur in an older person. Fast-growing (high-grade aggressive) non-Hodgkin lymphomas usually affect children and young adults. Lymphomas are classified by the specific characteristics of the cancer cells and the parts of the body affected.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptom of both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas is swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under the arms, or in the groin. Other symptoms include:\nBecause swollen lymph nodes caused by lymphoma usually are painless, they may get larger over a long time before the person notices. Also, fever may come and go for several weeks. Even the unexplained weight loss may continue for months before the person sees a doctor.\n",
      "Diagnosing lymphoma": "Diagnosis usually begins with a physical exam. Your doctor will check for swollen lymph nodes and organs throughout your body. He or she will look for general signs of disease. You will be asked about your health habits and past illnesses and treatments, too.\nIf your doctor suspects lymphoma, he or she will order blood tests to check the numbers and appearance of your blood cells (red cells, white cells, and platelets). Sometimes the diagnosis can be made with a special blood test called flow cytometry. This test is a way to sort and identify the different types of cells in the blood, including cancerous lymph cells.\nYour doctor will likely recommend a lymph node biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. In this test, all or part of a lymph node is removed using a needle or during minor surgery. A specialist then views the tissue under a microscope to check for lymphoma.\nYou may also need other tests, such as CT scans or an MRI of your chest and abdomen and/or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Often a bone marrow biopsy is performed. During this test, your doctor removes a sample of bone and liquid bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The samples are analyzed for signs of cancer.\nThese additional tests are done to determine the stage of lymphoma. The stages range from Stage I, in which the cancer is limited to one area, such as one lymph node, to Stage IV, in which the cancer is growing in many lymph nodes throughout your body or in the bone marrow or other organs.\nOccasionally, laparoscopic surgery is done to help to determine the cancer's stage. In this procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in your abdomen and uses a thin, lighted tube (a laparoscope) to see if cancer has spread to any internal organs. Small pieces of tissue also may be removed and examined under a microscope for signs of cancer.\n",
      "Expected duration of lymphoma": "Hodgkin lymphoma can often be cured.\nThe duration of non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies. Some forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are slow-growing. In these cases, treatment may be postponed until symptoms appear.\nIn general, both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma will continue to worsen unless treated.\n",
      "Preventing lymphoma": "There is no definitive way to prevent lymphoma. But you may be able to lower your risk by taking precautions to avoid becoming infected with HIV.\n",
      "Treating lymphoma": "Radiation is the traditional treatment for Hodgkin disease that is localized to one group of lymph nodes. For more advanced stages of Hodgkin disease, combination chemotherapy with three or four different drugs is used.\nTreatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma depends on the grade of lymphoma (low or high), the stage of the disease, and the age and health of the patient.\nIn a bone marrow transplant, the patient's bone marrow cells are killed and then cancer-free bone marrow cells are injected. Stem cells are immature cells that grow into blood cells. In a stem cell transplant, the patient's stem cells are removed and treated to kill the cancer before being injected back into the patient.\nImmunotherapy taps the body's immune system to kill cancer cells or limit their growth. Monoclonal antibodies are the most commonly used biologic therapy to treat lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies are very specific proteins that attack certain cells. These antibodies are made in a laboratory.\nMonoclonal antibodies are injected into the bloodstream. They may be used alone or to transport drugs, toxins, or radioactive material to cancer cells.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you notice swelling of one or more lymph nodes that persists for more than two weeks and/or you have other symptoms of lymphoma such as unexplained fever, weight loss, and drenching night sweats.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for patients with lymphoma depends on many factors. These include:\nWith both types of lymphomas, it is important to be monitored throughout your life for the development of second cancers.\n",

      "What is macular degeneration?": "Macular degeneration is a common cause of vision problems among older people. Macular degeneration is also called age-related macular degeneration, or AMD.\nAMD damages the macula. The macula is a part of the eye that is responsible for seeing sharp details directly in the center of the field of vision. Damage caused by AMD can interfere with:\n\nMost people with AMD have fluffy, yellow-white spots on the macula. These spots are called drusen. Not everyone who gets AMD has these spots.\nThere are two forms of AMD:\n\n\nAge is the most important risk factor for AMD. Cigarette smoking and cardiovascular risk factors, such as high cholesterol levels, may also increase risk.\n",
      "Symptoms of macular degeneration": "Dry AMD sometimes does not cause any symptoms. Or, it can make central vision a little less clear. In a small number of cases, it gradually causes more significant blurring or loss of vision in the center of the visual field. In these more advanced cases, faces and printed words become hard to recognize.\nAs a first symptom of wet AMD, straight lines or edges appear crooked. Images become blurred. In some cases this is followed by a central blind spot, as in dry AMD. However, unlike in dry AMD, this vision loss usually develops rapidly.\nAMD generally does not affect side vision, even in advanced cases. Most patients can continue to function independently.\nPeople who have AMD may appear as though they see normally. But they may actually have difficulty recognizing friends. This can lead to social difficulties.\nSome people with vision loss from AMD experience visual hallucinations — that is, they see things, such as people and patterns, that are not there.\n",
      "Diagnosing macular degeneration": "Your doctor will ask questions about your health history and about any risk factors you may have for AMD. He or she then will test your visual acuity. An eye specialist called an ophthalmologist will dilate your pupils to thoroughly examine your eyes, looking for drusen and other abnormal changes in your retina. The eye doctor may perform additional specialized imaging to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration of macular degeneration": "AMD is a lifelong illness. However, few people with early AMD develop advanced AMD with vision loss.\n",
      "Preventing macular degeneration": "There is no proven way to prevent AMD.\nHowever, smokers are more likely to develop AMD. Quitting can help prevent the condition. Those who stopped smoking more than 20 years before do not appear to have a higher risk of AMD. Some people with a family history of AMD have an increased risk of developing it and definitely should avoid smoking.\nMore recent evidence suggests that a diet rich in green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts may reduce the risk of AMD.\n",
      "Treating macular degeneration": "Treatments can help slow or stop the disease from getting worse. Your treatment options depend on the type of AMD you have.\n",
      "Dry AMD": "For people with intermediate dry AMD, a specific combination of vitamins may slow the disease's progression. They may even prevent it from worsening to advanced AMD. For people with advanced AMD in only one eye, these vitamins may help prevent the other eye from being affected.\nThe original National Eye Institute's Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) suggested that the following vitamin formula could reduce the progression of dry AMD:\nHowever, concerns about the high level of vitamin A in the formula led to products with alternative ingredients that are safer. Talk with your doctor before starting any kind of AMD-related vitamin regimen. Be sure to mention if you take any other vitamins, including a multivitamin. Even the modified AREDS formulas can contain high doses of certain vitamins to avoid not getting too much of any particular one.\n",
      "Wet AMD": "The most common treatment for wet AMD is anti-VEGF therapy. When injected into the eye, these drugs may stop the growth of new abnormal blood vessels. They also decrease leakage from those vessels. Anti-VEGF therapy may even restore lost vision.\nPatients need to get injections regularly for several months to a year, and maybe longer. Possible side effects include:\nMost people don't develop these side effects.\nAnti-VEGF treatments are generally painless. The doctor numbs the eye before administering the injection.\nOther treatments that can slow or stop the progression of wet AMD include thermal laser surgery and photodynamic therapy. These are used much less frequently than anti-VEGF therapy.\nLaser surgery burns the leaky blood vessels to seal them. Unfortunately, the laser treatment can also destroy some surrounding healthy tissue, thereby harming vision.\nBoth laser surgery and photodynamic therapy can temporarily slow the worsening of wet AMD, but they don't stop or reverse the damage. Both procedures may need to be repeated from time to time. In photodynamic therapy, a light-activated drug called verteporfin (Visudyne) is injected into a vein in your arm. The drug moves through your body and to your eyes. The doctor shines a light into your eyes to activate the drug. The activated drug kills abnormal blood vessels.\nFor active or sight-threatening disease, other options include injections of bevacizumab, aflibercept, or ranibizumab into the eye with or without laser surgery.\nFor people with wet AMD, your doctor may recommend a Mediterranean-style diet, although there is no evidence that diet actually helps in prevention or slowing the progression of vision loss.\nThe treatment of wet AMD is changing quickly. Make sure to seek treatment from a retinal specialist who has kept up to date on this rapidly evolving field.\n",
      "Low vision aids": "Patients who have lost vision because of AMD may be able to use low-vision aids to read or do other tasks.\nLow-vision aids include:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you notice any change in your vision. This is especially true if the change happens suddenly and interferes with your ability to read newsprint or to recognize people's faces.\nIf you are at high risk of vision loss from AMD, you may keep a copy of the Amsler grid at home. Check your own vision periodically.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Dry AMD develops slowly. Most people who have it continue to lead relatively normal lives, especially if only one eye is affected.\nIf you have wet AMD, consult with a skilled retina specialist to see what form of therapy is best for you.\n",

      "What is major depression?": "In major depression, the most prominent symptom is a severe and persistent low mood, profound sadness, or a sense of despair. The mood can sometimes appear as irritability. Or the person suffering major depression may not be able to enjoy activities that are usually enjoyable.\nMajor depression is more than just a passing blue mood, a \"bad day,\" or temporary sadness. The symptoms of major depression are defined as lasting at least two weeks but usually they go on much longer — months or even years.\nA variety of symptoms usually accompany the low mood, and the symptoms can vary significantly among different people.\nMany people with depression also have anxiety. They may worry more than average about their physical health. They may have excessive conflict in their relationships and may function poorly at work. Sexual functioning may be a problem. People with depression are at more risk for abusing alcohol or other substances.\nDepression probably involves changes in the areas of the brain that control mood. Nerve cells may be functioning poorly in certain regions of the brain. Communication between nerve cells or nerve circuits can make it harder for a person to regulate mood. Hormone changes may also negatively affect mood. An individual's life experience affects these biological processes. And genetic makeup influences how vulnerable a person is to getting this illness.\nAn episode of depression can be triggered by a stressful life event. But in many cases, depression does not appear to be related to a specific event.\nA major depressive episode may occur just once in a person's life or may return repeatedly. People who have many episodes of major depression may also have periods of persistent but milder depressed mood.\nDuring a major depressive episode, thinking can get out of step with reality. The person has \"psychotic symptoms\" such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations).\nSome people who have episodes of major depression also have episodes of relatively high energy or irritability. They may sleep far less than normal, and may dream up grand plans that could never be carried out. The severe form of this is called \"mania\" or a manic episode. Psychotic symptoms also occur in mania. If a person has milder symptoms of mania and does not lose touch with reality, it is called \"hypomania\" or a hypomanic episode.\nA major depressive episode may occur within the first two to three months after giving birth to a baby. In that case, it may be called major depressive disorder with peripartum onset. Most people refer to it as postpartum depression.\nDepression that occurs mainly during the winter months is usually called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It also may be called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern.\nEpisodes of depression can occur at any age. Depression is diagnosed in women twice as often as in men. People who have a family member with major depression are more likely to develop depression or drinking problems.\n",
      "Symptoms of major depression": "A depressed person may gain or lose weight, eat more or less than usual, have difficulty concentrating, and have trouble sleeping or sleep more than usual. He or she may feel tired and have no energy for work or play. Small burdens or obstacles may appear impossible to manage. The person can appear slowed down or agitated and restless. The symptoms can be quite noticeable to others.\nA particularly painful symptom of this illness is an unshakable feeling of worthlessness and guilt. The person may feel guilty about a specific life experience or may feel general guilt not related to anything in particular.\nIf pain and self-criticism become great enough, they can lead to feelings of hopelessness, self-destructive behavior, or thoughts of death and suicide. The vast majority of people who suffer severe depression do not attempt or commit suicide, but they are more likely to do so than people who are not depressed.\nThe thoughts of people with major depression are often colored by their dark mood. For example, pessimistic ideas may be out of proportion with the reality of the situation. Sometimes, the depressed thinking is distorted enough to be called \"psychotic\"; that is, the person has great difficulty recognizing reality. Sometimes, depressed people develop delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (false perceptions).\nSymptoms of major depression include:\n",
      "Diagnosing major depression": "A primary care physician or a mental health professional usually can diagnose depression by asking questions about medical history and symptoms. By definition, major depression is diagnosed when a person has many of the symptoms listed above for at least two weeks.\nMany people with depression do not seek evaluation or treatment because of society's attitudes about depression. The person may feel the depression is his or her fault or may worry about what others will think. Also, the depression itself may distort a person's ability to recognize the problem. Therefore family members or friends may need to encourage the depression sufferer to seek help.\nThere are no specific tests for depression. However, it is important to be evaluated by a primary care physician to make sure symptoms are not being caused by a medical condition or medication.\n",
      "Expected duration of major depression": "On average, untreated episodes last several months. However, episodes of major depression can last any length of time. And symptoms can vary in intensity during an episode.\nIf depression is not treated, it can become chronic (long-lasting). Treatment can shorten the length and severity of a depressive episode.\n",
      "Preventing major depression": "There is no way to prevent major depression, but detecting it early can help. Treatment can both reduce symptoms and help to prevent the illness from returning.\n",
      "Treating major depression": "The most helpful treatment is a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed first. They include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro). In general, they are fairly easy to take and relatively safe compared with previous generations of antidepressants. One of the more common side effects is decreased sexual pleasure and delayed orgasm.\nOther effective antidepressants include bupropion (Wellbutrin), venlafaxine (Effexor), mirtazapine (Remeron), and duloxetine (Cymbalta).\nIt often takes two to six weeks from the start of medication to see improvement. It may take several trials to find the medication that works best. Once the right medication is found, it may take up to a few months to find a proper dose and for the full positive effect to be seen.\nSometimes, two different antidepressants are used together. Or a mood stabilizer, such as lithium (sold under several brand names) or valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote), is added. If psychotic symptoms are present, a doctor may prescribe a second medication.\nA number of psychotherapy techniques have been demonstrated to be helpful, depending on the causes of the depression, the availability of family and other social support, and personal style and preference. A technique called cognitive behavioral therapy is designed to help a depressed person recognize negative thinking and teaches techniques for controlling symptoms. Psychodynamic, insight-oriented, or interpersonal psychotherapy can help depressed people to sort out conflicts in important relationships or explore the history behind symptoms.\nIf you suffer from depression, you will benefit from educating yourself about the illness. You could also make use of support that may be available in your community.\nOptions for severe or persistent depression despite the usual medications include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), ketamine, and transcranial medical stimulation.\n",
      "Antidepressants and suicide risk": "The FDA requires antidepressant manufacturers to include a so-called \"black box warning\" on their product labeling. The warning is intended to address the concern that — only for children, adolescents, and young adults — antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide. This problem has remained a focus of research, but the evidence remains hard to interpret.\nMany experts worry that this warning has had a chilling effect on antidepressant treatment. The danger is that doctors and patients both could shy away from a helpful intervention. When depression goes untreated, the risk of suicide goes up.\nA small number of young people taking these medications probably do have an unusual reaction and end up feeling much worse rather than better. Furthermore, any medication taken to affect mood can have an unexpected negative effect.\nTherefore, it is always important to monitor treatment closely. No matter what age you are or what treatment you're getting, report any troubling symptoms or worsening mood to your doctor immediately.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Depression is a painful and potentially dangerous illness, so you should contact a health care professional if you have any suspicion that you or a loved one is depressed.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Treatment of depression has become quite sophisticated and effective. The prognosis with treatment is excellent. The intensity of symptoms and the frequency of episodes often are significantly reduced. Many people recover completely.\nWhen treatment is successful, it is important to stay in close touch with your doctor or therapist, because maintenance treatment is often required to prevent depression from returning.\n",

      "What is it?": "Malaria is an infection caused by single-celled parasites that enter the blood through the bite of an Anopheles mosquito. These parasites, called plasmodia, belong to at least five species. Most human infections are caused by eitherPlasmodium falciparumorPlasmodium vivax.\nPlasmodiumparasites spend several parts of their life cycle inside humans and another part inside mosquitoes. During the human part of their life cycle,Plasmodiumparasites infect and multiply inside liver cells and red blood cells.\nSome infected blood cells burst because of the multiplying parasites inside. Many more infected red blood cells are broken down by your spleen or liver, which filter out and remove damaged or aging red blood cells from circulation. BothPlasmodiumparasites in the bloodstream and irritants that are released from broken red blood cells cause malaria symptoms.\nMost deaths from malaria are caused byP.falciparum,which causes severe disease. BeforeP.falciparummalaria causes a red blood cell to burst, it can make the surface of the cell stick to other cells like it. This causes the blood to clot within small blood vessels, which can severely damage organs.\nPeople who have lived all their life in a country with a high rate of malaria have typically been exposed to malaria parasites many times. After the first exposure, your immune system begins to protect you, so re-infection may cause few or no symptoms.\nYour immune system does not remain active against malaria for more than a few years if you are not exposed again. This explains why people can live for years in the tropics without being bothered by malaria. However, people from the tropics who spend several years in another country may lose their immune protection.\nPeople who have never had a malaria infection (such as young children and travelers) and pregnant women are more likely to have severe symptoms from malaria.\nUsually, symptoms appear within the first several weeks after the infected mosquito bites you. In people withP. vivaxorP. ovaleinfections, it is possible for somePlasmodiumparasites to remain inside the liver. If this happens, dormant parasite forms can become active and trigger malaria symptoms months or years after the first exposure.\nIn regions where there is a high rate of malaria infection, malaria can be spread in other ways than through a mosquito bite, such as through contaminated blood transfusions, transplantation of contaminated organs, and shared drug needles. In pregnant women, malaria infection can pass through the bloodstream to the developing fetus, causing low birth weight or fetal death. This is most common withP. falciparuminfection.\nMalaria is one of the major causes of preventable death in the world today. It affects more than 500 million people worldwide and causes one to two million deaths every year. It is a tropical disease. Therefore, it is rare in the United States and European countries, where almost all cases are seen in people who have traveled from countries where malaria is common.\nIn the tropics, the particular species ofPlasmodiumvaries from country to country. In some areas, new strains of malaria have emerged that are resistant to some antimalarial drugs. This emergence of drug-resistant strains has complicated the treatment and prevention of malaria in tropical countries and in travelers.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of malaria can begin as early as six to eight days after a bite by an infected mosquito. They include\nIf treatment is delayed, more severe complications of malaria can occur. Most people who develop these complications are infected with theP. falciparumspecies. They include\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may suspect that you have malaria based on your symptoms and your history of foreign travel. When your doctor examines you, he or she may find an enlarged spleen because the spleen commonly swells during a malaria infection.\nTo confirm the diagnosis of malaria, your doctor will take samples of blood to be smeared on glass slides. These blood smears will be stained with special chemicals in a laboratory and examined forPlasmodiumparasites. Blood tests will be done to determine whether malaria has affected your levels of red blood cells and platelets, the ability of your blood to clot, your blood chemistry, and your liver and kidney function.\n",
      "Expected duration": "With proper treatment, symptoms of malaria usually go away quickly, with a cure within two weeks. Without proper treatment, malaria episodes (fever, chills, sweating) can return periodically over a period of years. After repeated exposure, patients will become partially immune and develop milder disease.\n",
      "Prevention": "Researchers are working to create a vaccine against malaria. Vaccination is expected to become an important tool to prevent malaria in the future.\nOne way to prevent malaria is to avoid mosquito bites with the following strategies:\nIt is strongly recommended that you take preventive medication when you travel to a region of the world that has malaria. Keep in mind that these medications can prevent most malaria infections, but travelers occasionally get malaria even when they are taking one of these drugs. If you develop an illness with fever within a year of your return, seek immediate medical attention and tell a health care professional about your travel.\nThe four antimalarial medications most commonly prescribed in the United States for foreign travel are:\nIn addition to one of these medications, you also may need to take a medication called primaquine (sold as a generic) when you return home if you stayed for more than several months in an area of the world where you had heavy exposure to mosquitoes. This extra precaution eliminates dormant forms of malaria that may have entered your liver and survived even though you were taking preventive medication during your trip.\nPrimaquine is taken daily for two weeks after you have left the area where malaria is common. People with a genetic shortage of a normal enzyme (G6PD deficiency) cannot take primaquine because they can develop severe anemia.\nThere are potential drug interactions between some of the medications used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and those used to treat malaria. If you are HIV-positive, you should check with your doctor before taking malarial medications.\n",
      "Treatment": "Malaria is treated with antimalarial drugs and measures to control symptoms, including medications to control fever, antiseizure medications when needed, fluids, and electrolytes. The type of medications that are used to treat malaria depends on the severity of the disease and the likelihood of chloroquine resistance. The drugs available to treat malaria include\nPeople with falciparum malaria have the most severe symptoms. People with falciparum malaria may need to be monitored in the intensive care unit of a hospital during the first days of treatment because the disease can cause breathing failure, coma, and kidney failure.\nFor pregnant women, chloroquine is the preferred treatment for malaria. Quinine, proguanil, and clindamycin typically are used for pregnant people with malaria that is resistant to chloroquine.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor before you travel to a tropical country where malaria is common, so that you can take medications to prevent malaria. After you return, call your doctor if you develop a high fever within the first several months.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In the United States, most people with malaria have an excellent prognosis if they are treated properly with antimalarial drugs. Without treatment, malaria can be fatal, particularlyP. falciparum.People with severe malaria have the greatest danger of death. From 10% to 40% of people with severe malaria die even with advanced medical treatment.P. falciparumis more likely to cause severe disease among young children, pregnant women, and travelers who are exposed to malaria for the first time.\n",

      "What is it?": "Marfan syndrome is a genetic (inherited) disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. Connective tissue is the tough, fibrous, elastic tissue that connects one part of the body with another. It is a major part of tendons, ligaments, bones, cartilage and the walls of large blood vessels. In Marfan syndrome, the body can't produce normal fibrillin, an important building block of connective tissue.\nThe problem in Marfan syndrome is caused by a mutation (change) in a gene. Genes are segments of DNA that direct the body to produce proteins. In many families with inherited Marfan syndrome, the mutation affects the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, although other gene mutations may be involved in some cases.\nBecause of the inherited problem producing fibrillin, people with Marfan syndrome have from many different problems related to weakness in connective tissue. These problems include:\nIn people with Marfan syndrome, connective tissue weakness can cause mitral valve prolapse (a \"floppy\" mitral valve that doesn't close properly) or mitral valve regurgitation (a severe problem in closing the mitral valve that results in a significant backflow of blood into the left atrium).\nIt also can lead to an abnormal swelling or dilatation (aneurysm) in the heart's main artery, the aorta, typically at the root of the aorta where it leaves the heart. This aneurysm can lead to aortic regurgitation (abnormal backflow of blood when the heart tries to pump blood forward), aortic dissection (a spreading tear in the inner wall of the aorta that causes a separation between the aorta's inner and outer layers) and aortic rupture (a break in the wall of the aorta, with leakage of blood).\nAbout one in 5,000 people have Marfan syndrome. Most inherit the abnormal gene from a parent. However, about 20% percent of people with Marfan syndrome have what is called a de novo mutation. This means the genetic mutation occurred after conception and was not inherited from a parent.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Marfan syndrome affects each person differently, and the presence and severity of symptoms can vary. Most often, people with Marfan syndrome become aware of the disorder after they find out that someone else in their family has it or because of their appearance. People with Marfan syndrome typically are tall with long, thin extremities, with or without other skeletal changes.\nVision problems, including nearsightedness and ectopia lentis, usually develop. The symptoms, such as chest pain and shortness of breath, can be very dramatic if there is expansion of an aortic aneurysm or heart valve damage.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about any family history of Marfan syndrome, as well as about any family members who are unusually tall and thin, whether or not they have vision problems. Your doctor also may ask about any family history of sudden death resulting from aortic dissection or rupture.\nYour doctor may suspect Marfan syndrome based on this family history and your physical appearance. The diagnosis can be confirmed if you have a history of ectopia lentis and also have a dilated aortic root (the first part of the aorta as it exits the heart) visible on echocardiography. Echocardiography is a painless test that uses sound waves to outline the structure of the heart and its major vessels.\nThe diagnosis will be even more certain if you have other skeletal abnormalities (chest wall deformities or scoliosis), excessively mobile joints, or heart murmurs due to aortic or mitral valve abnormalities. Genetic testing can check for specific chromosomal abnormalities related to abnormal fibrillin production for those suspected of having the disease or for close relatives of those with the condition.  However, the absence of a known mutation associated with the disease does not exclude Marfan syndrome. Similarly, the presence of a mutation associated with the condition does not confirm the diagnosis since some people with these mutations never develop the syndrome and others develop related disorders separate from Marfan syndrome.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Marfan syndrome is a lifelong condition.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent Marfan syndrome. People with Marfan syndrome and their relatives may wish to seek genetic counseling to talk about their risk of passing the disorder to their children. A person with Marfan syndrome has a 50% risk of passing the abnormal gene to child.  Complications of Marfan syndrome may be prevented with proper care; as examples, medications to lower blood pressure may prevent expansion of an aortic aneurysm and surgery to repair an expanding aneurysm may prevent aortic rupture.\n",
      "Treatment": "There is no medical treatment to reverse the fibrillin abnormality in people with Marfan syndrome. In the future, research on a strain of mice that are born with similar fibrillin problems or advances in gene editing may lead to successful treatments for Marfan syndrome.\nUntil then, doctors try to prevent or delay the aortic changes seen in people with Marfan syndrome by prescribing medication that decreases the pressure inside the aorta. Your doctor may advise that you take a beta-blocker and/or an angiotensin receptor blocker. Beta blockers, such as propranolol (Inderal), metoprolol (Lopressor) and atenolol (Tenormin), decrease the strain on the aorta's wall by slowing the heart rate and reducing the force of heart contractions, especially during exercise. Losartan and other angiotensin receptor blockers help lower blood pressure, which reduces the stress on artery walls.\nIf you have Marfan syndrome, your doctor will monitor your heart health with periodic echocardiograms to check for developing problems in the aorta and mitral valve. If a serious problem is found, you may need surgery to replace the aortic valve, mitral valve or part of the aorta. Doctors become concerned when the aortic root size measured on an echocardiogram expands over time. Once it reaches 5 centimeters or more, many experts recommend surgery. Some recommend surgery with lesser aortic root enlargement, especially if there is rapid expansion of the aorta over time.\nYou should follow a non-strenuous exercise program that involves non-competitive, non-contact sports (walking, bicycling, jogging), which you can do at your own pace.\nIf you have Marfan-related scoliosis of 20 to 40 degrees, you can be treated with a brace and physical therapy. For scoliosis greater than 45 degrees, surgery is often recommended. You should have eye examinations regularly to look for Marfan-related eye problems. If you have ectopia lentis, you may be able to be treated with special lenses called aphakic lenses and special eye drops to widen the pupil, rather than surgery. If eye surgery is necessary, it should be done in an ophthalmology center that specializes in the treatment of Marfan syndrome.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have vision problems. In many people with Marfan syndrome, the eye doctor (ophthalmologist) is the first to suspect the diagnosis based on findings during a vision exam. Also call your doctor if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, especially during exercise, or an irregular pulse.\nIf you know that you have Marfan syndrome, call your doctor immediately if you experience severe pain in the front or back of the chest, sudden weakness or tingling in the legs or arms, or an unexplained fever. These may be symptoms of aortic dissection, a medical emergency that can lead to aortic rupture, which is fatal in 90 percent to 95 percent of cases.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Despite the high risk for Marfan-related cardiovascular problems, the average life expectancy of those with Marfan syndrome is nearly 70 years.\n",

      "What is it?": "Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), now more commonly referred to as monogenic diabetes, is an inherited form of diabetes mellitus. It is caused by a change in one of eleven genes. Up to 5% of all diabetes cases may be due to MODY. Just like other people with diabetes, people with MODY have trouble regulating their blood sugar levels.\nThis disorder can be confused with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In type 1, the pancreas cannot make and release enough insulin. People with type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, usually make enough insulin, but their bodies cannot respond to it effectively (known as insulin resistance). Type 2 diabetes is usually associated with being overweight, but that is not true of type 1 diabetes or MODY. However, obesity does matter. An obese person with a MODY gene mutation may develop symptoms of diabetes sooner than someone of normal weight.\nMODY is more likely to affect adolescents and young adults, but it can occur at any age. Just like other forms of diabetes, MODY can cause complications throughout the body, including increased risk of heart and vascular disease, kidney disease, and blindness.\nThere are different types of MODY caused by changes in different genes. Treatment varies, depending on the type of MODY.\nMODY is a dominant genetic condition, which means that people who inherit one copy of the gene mutation that causes MODY from either their mother or father will be affected. Affected people also have a 50% chance of passing along the gene mutation to each of their children.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms related to MODY tend to develop gradually. This is similar to what happens to people with type 2 diabetes. In comparison, the symptoms of type 1 diabetes often occur rather quickly over a few weeks.\nEarly symptoms of MODY may include blurry vision, recurrent skin infections, or yeast infections. But there may be no symptoms at all. People with MODY often have high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) for many years before they have any symptoms. The increased blood sugar develops gradually, and may only be noticed if a doctor does a blood sugar test during a checkup.\nWithout treatment, blood sugars will continue to rise, causing:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The first step in diagnosing MODY is having a blood sugar test. If the results show high levels of sugar that indicate diabetes, your doctor has to figure out if you have MODY or another type of diabetes. Getting the correct diagnosis is important because treatment of MODY can be different than treatment for type 1 or 2 diabetes.\nBlood tests can help your doctor determine which kind of diabetes you have. For example, in type 1 diabetes, antibodies attack the pancreas, but people with MODY do not have these antibodies. Your doctor will also look for signs in your blood tests that indicate whether you have insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is not present in non-obese people with MODY; however, it does occur in obese people with MODY.\nIt may be difficult to tell whether an obese person has type 2 diabetes or MODY. The great majority of obese people with diabetes will have type 2 diabetes. A family history of MODY may be the only clue that this type of diabetes is affecting a particular person.\nMODY can also be diagnosed by a genetic test. This type of testing will determine the exact type of MODY, and can be done before a patient has any symptoms. If a mutation in one of the MODY genes is found, then type 1 or type 2 diabetes can be ruled out.\n",
      "Expected duration": "MODY is an inherited disorder that lasts throughout a person's lifetime. MODY 2 generally stays mild. But the symptoms and complications vary depending on the specific genetic variant.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you are related to a person with a MODY mutation, you can get a genetic test to see if you are at risk of developing MODY. The first step would be for your affected relative to get a genetic test for MODY. If a mutation is found in one of the MODY genes, the lab could test you for the same mutation. It's important to make sure the affected person in your family has a detectable mutation, because genetic testing is not always able to find a mutation. If you also have a risk for MODY, you can act to avoid obesity by eating a healthy diet and exercising. Avoiding obesity may not prevent MODY, but it can postpone the development of symptoms until later in life, and also has other positive health benefits.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment is different for the different forms of MODY.\nPeople with any type of MODY will respond better to treatment if they are not overweight or obese. Therefore, overweight and obese people should include losing weight as one of their treatment goals.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Symptoms of MODY may develop gradually. If you have the symptoms described above, make an appointment with your primary care provider. You may also need to see an endocrinologist who specializes in diabetes.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most types of MODY can lead to the same complications as typical type 1 or type 2 diabetes, including increased risk of heart disease, kidney failure, and blindness. Which problems occur depends on which gene is affected. Some people with MODY develop milder hyperglycemia. They may not require any medication, and are much less likely to develop long-term complications. Keeping blood sugar close to normal will minimize complications of MODY, as it does with other types of diabetes.\n",

      "What is it?": "Measles, also known as rubeola, is an infection, mainly of the nose, windpipe and lungs that is very contagious, meaning it spreads easily from person to person. The measles virus usually spreads when someone comes into contact with droplets from another person that contain the virus. This can happen when someone with the virus coughs or sneezes. It also can happen when people touch used tissues, share drinking glasses or touch hands that have infected droplets on them.\n\nOnce the virus gets into the body, the infection spreads throughout the nose, windpipe and lungs, into the skin and other body organs.\nA person with measles can spread the virus to others from one to two days before any symptoms begin (or three to five days before the rash) to four days after the rash appears.\nMeasles typically causes moderate illness. In younger children, complications include middle ear infection (otitis media), pneumonia, croup and diarrhea. In adults, the illness tends to be even more severe. It is not unusual for older patients to require hospital treatment for measles-related pneumonia.\nThe most serious consequences of measles are rare. In less than 1 of every 1,000 cases, measles produces encephalitis (brain infection), with an immediate risk of seizures, coma and death, and a long-term risk of intellectual disabilities or epilepsy. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is an extraordinarily rare chronic form of measles encephalitis that causes brain damage. In unusual cases, measles also can directly attack the digestive organs (including the liver), the heart muscle or the kidneys. A pregnant woman who is infected with measles has an increased risk of premature labor, miscarriage or delivery of a low-birth-weight infant.\nBefore an effective vaccine was available, there were at least 400,000 cases of measles reported each year in the United States, with probably more than 3 million unreported cases. The number of cases has decreased dramatically since childhood vaccination became routine. However, in recent years, there have been more outbreaks, primarily related to more parents refusing MMR vaccination of their children.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Measles symptoms begin about 8 to 12 days after coming in contact with someone who has measles. The first symptoms include coughing, runny and stuffy nose, a general, sick feeling (malaise), red eyes with tearing (conjunctivitis), and a fever up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Within two to four days, these symptoms are followed by Koplik's spots in the mouth, bluish white or gray spots on a red background, seen inside the cheeks.\nWith a measles rash, you usually see non-itchy pink or bright red spots. The rash begins at the hairline and behind the ears, then spreads downward to the neck, trunk, arms and legs, palms and soles. The rash begins to fade about four days later in the same order that it appeared, first from the head and neck, then the trunk and arms and legs. The fading rash may leave behind a temporary brownish discoloration or flakiness that clears up two to three days later. Some people also have big lymph nodes (swollen glands), diarrhea and vomiting.\nPatients with compromised immune systems are more likely to develop severe complications from measles, but they may not develop the typical measles rash.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will check for a congested nose, red eyes, Koplik's spots and the typical measles rash. He or she will ask if you have been traveling outside the country or have been exposed to anyone with measles or an undiagnosed rash. Even if you did not have face-to-face contact with an infected person, your doctor will want to know if you go to the same school, live in the same household or dormitory or work in the same building. Your doctor will check your medical records to see if and when you were immunized against measles, and the number of doses of measles vaccine. These are given as part of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) shot.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may order blood tests to look for specific antibodies that fight against the measles virus. Antibodies are made by the immune system to protect against an infection.\n",
      "Expected duration": "The symptoms of measles usually last about 10 days.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can prevent measles with the measles vaccine, given as part of the MMR combination vaccine. In the United States, most children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first at 12 to 15 months of age and a booster dose at 4 to 6 years. If a person has not been immunized against measles and has been exposed to the disease, the vaccine may provide protection if it is given within 72 hours of the exposure. If the exposure is beyond three days but no longer than six days later, the person can receive an injection of immune globulin (IG), which contains antibodies to protect against the measles virus. It can prevent or at least minimize the symptoms of a measles infection. IG also can be used after exposure to measles in infants less than 6 months of age and in people who have conditions that weaken the immune system.\n",
      "Treatment": "There is no specific treatment for measles. In people who are otherwise healthy, measles symptoms are treated with bed rest, a cool-mist humidifier to soothe respiratory passages and relieve cough, and acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to reduce fever and relieve discomfort. Do not use aspirin in children with measles because of the risk of developing a rare liver and brain problem called Reye's syndrome. Children and adults who develop a middle ear infection or bacterial pneumonia are treated with antibiotics.\nIn people hospitalized with measles and its complications, especially children 6 months to 2 years, some doctors prescribe high doses of vitamin A. Low levels of this vitamin have been found in children with severe cases of measles. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all children with measles who live in communities where vitamin A deficiency is common should receive vitamin A.\nIn people with weakened immune systems or those who are severely ill from measles, the antiviral medication ribavirin (Virazole) occasionally has been used, but no controlled trials have proven its benefits. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of ribavirin to treat measles.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you or your child develops symptoms of measles, even if you or your child was immunized. Not everyone has received the two doses of the MMR vaccine they need to be fully protected. Call your doctor to review the status of your measles immunity if a measles outbreak occurs in your school or workplace. If you are considering becoming pregnant, contact your obstetrician to ensure that you are immunized against measles and other infectious diseases that can affect your unborn child. Always check with your child's doctor at each visit to be sure he or she is up-to-date for all immunizations.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most healthy people recover completely from measles. About 3% of adults with measles develop symptoms of pneumonia severe enough to require hospital treatment. Death from measles complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis occurs in 1 to 2 of every 1,000 cases, more commonly in infants, older adults or people with weakened immune defenses.\n",

      "What is it?": "Meckel's diverticulum is a small pouch in the wall of the lower small intestine. The pouch is a congenital (present at birth) abnormality that affects approximately 2% of the population. The pouch, or diverticulum, seems to be leftover tissue from the development of the digestive system. This tissue normally is reabsorbed before birth. When it contains gastric (stomach) tissue, it is more likely to cause bleeding.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most people with Meckel's diverticulum do not experience any symptoms. Symptoms occur only if the diverticulum bleeds, becomes infected, or causes an obstruction. These symptoms generally occur during the first few years of life, although they may not appear until adulthood. The bleeding, even when severe, is usually painless. An infection and blockage can cause mild to severe abdominal pain and discomfort.\nSigns and symptoms may include\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A Meckel's diverticulum can be difficult to diagnose because it does not show up on standard tests for intestinal bleeding or blockages. Its symptoms can mimic those of other conditions, such as appendicitis or gallbladder disease.\nOne of the best ways to confirm the presence of a Meckel's diverticulum is through a special nuclear medicine scan in which a small dose of radioactive dye is injected into the bloodstream. The dye collects in stomach tissue, so a diverticulum shows up on the scan if stomach tissue is present. X-rays usually show if the intestine is blocked. However, x-rays usually cannot identify Meckel's diverticulum as the cause.\n",
      "Expected duration": "A Meckel's diverticulum remains for a lifetime unless it is removed surgically.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent a Meckel's diverticulum from forming during fetal development.\n",
      "Treatment": "Most people with a Meckel's diverticulum do not even know they have it, and no treatment is required. When problems occur, treatment depends on their type and severity. Infections are treated with antibiotics. Blood transfusions may be needed for extensive bleeding. Iron replacement may be required to correct anemia. Bowel rest, in which the patient is not allowed to eat, drink, or take pills, and receives nutrition and fluids intravenously (through a vein), is sometimes needed when there is a blockage. A diverticulum causing problems may need to be removed surgically.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Seek prompt medical attention if you have any of the symptoms of a problematic Meckel's diverticulum, such as passage of blood from the rectum or bloody stools. If you have abdominal pain or dizziness, you should call your doctor to determine if you need an evaluation right away.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With surgery, full recovery can be expected.\n",

      "What is medication allergy?": "A true allergic reaction to medication occurs when the immune system is activated in response to a drug. The medication can be taken by mouth, injected into the body, or rubbed on the skin. The symptoms from an allergic reaction vary from a mild skin rash to sudden swelling of many body parts with a life-threatening drop in blood pressure.\nMost people with a drug allergy have been exposed to that drug or a similar drug before. During the earlier exposure, immune cells formed antibodies against the drug. Antibodies are proteins created by the immune system to battle foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. When a person is exposed to the drug again, the antibodies go into action, setting off the allergic response. The symptoms of drug allergy may happen immediately or after taking the drug for a week or more.\nThe reason a person develops a particular drug allergy is usually unknown, but genetics probably play a significant role.\nDrug allergies can pose a significant problem, not only because of the symptoms they cause, but also because they can prevent or hinder the use of the more effective medications to treat medical conditions.\nFor many, medication allergies go undetected until they take a drug and have an allergic reaction.\nMany people are sensitive to medications, but not all of these sensitivities are true allergic reactions. Some adverse reactions to drugs are side effects. Among the most common side effects are upset stomach, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and a skin reaction to sunlight called photosensitivity. However, drug allergies are not the same thing as side effects. Side effects do not involve the immune system, and sometimes can be avoided by lowering the dose. In order for the reaction to be an allergy, the immune system must be involved.\n",
      "Symptoms of medication allergy": "Symptoms of drug allergies vary depending on the type of immune mechanisms involved. The most common reaction is a skin rash. If you have been exposed to the drug before, the rash may start quickly, within the first day or two after taking the drug. The reaction also can be delayed and not occur until eight to 10 days after starting the drug. It is even possible to develop the rash after you have finished a one week course of medication. When this does occur, it is usually related to an antibiotic.\nSymptoms that appear within hours of taking the drug — called acute symptoms — usually involve a skin rash, hives or itching. However, in more severe cases, symptoms can advance rapidly to include nasal congestion, rapid pulse rate, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, facial swelling, dizziness and light-headedness. This type of reaction, called anaphylaxis, represents the most serious kind of allergic reaction. Untreated, it can lead to death within minutes.\nA less common type of allergic reaction is called serum sickness. This can occur days or even a week after starting a medication, even if you have never been exposed to the medication before. The symptoms of serum sickness include skin rashes, hives, fever, and joint pain. In rare instances, a different type of allergic reaction can cause red blood cells to be destroyed. This is called hemolytic anemia.\nIf you develop sensitivity to one medication, using other medications with similar chemical structures can be risky. For example, if a person has developed hives or anaphylaxis after taking any of the penicillins, he or she should avoid taking a cephalosporin antibiotic such as cephalexin (Biocef, Keflex, Keftab).\n",
      "Diagnosing medication allergy": "A doctor will base the diagnosis on a physical examination and your symptoms. In most cases, a doctor will suspect that your problem is a drug allergy if you have a history of allergic reactions after the use of certain medications.\nSkin tests sometimes can be used to determine if someone has an allergy to a medication. Penicillin skin testing, for example, involves an injection just beneath the skin of a small amount of one part of the penicillin molecule. People with a penicillin allergy will develop a reaction at the site of injection that can be measured. However, these tests are not always reliable since only a part of the penicillin molecule is injected. This test often is used for a person who needs a penicillin-like drug to treat a serious infection.\n",
      "Expected duration of medication allergy": "Allergic reactions to drugs are usually self-limiting and only last for a few days after the drug is discontinued. In some cases, however, a more severe reaction can occur. Rarely, an allergic skin reaction can cause marked sloughing of the skin, a condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Patients who experience this complication require treatment similar to burn patients. The skin may take months to heal completely. Drugs associated with TEN include sulfa-based antibiotics, allopurinol (Zyloprim), some seizure medications, and ampicillin (sold under several brand names).\n",
      "Preventing medication allergy": "The best way to avoid a medication allergy is to avoid the medication that can cause it. However, this is not always possible. If you have a history of allergy to food, pollen, certain soaps or cosmetics, and other common products, make sure your health care professional knows. You also should make sure you tell your health care professional about any drug reactions that you had in the past. Learn about all medications you are given or over-the-counter medications that you may purchase on your own. Always talk to your doctor and/or your pharmacist for recommendations about which drugs you should avoid or should take if you have a history of medication allergy. Whenever you are dealing with a health care professional who is not familiar with your medical history, be sure to tell him or her of your drug sensitivities. Keep a list in your wallet for easy reference and consider wearing a medical identification bracelet or necklace.\n",
      "Treating medication allergy": "Once you have a reaction to medication, the treatment depends on the severity of the reaction. If you have just a skin rash but otherwise feel well, it may be enough to stop taking the medication. Otherwise, treatment will focus on relieving symptoms. If you suspect a drug reaction, stop taking the drug and contact your health care professional, who can help to determine if the reaction is a true drug allergy and suggest an alternative medication if one is needed.\nAn antihistamine may be recommended to decrease itching and other histamine-related symptoms. Corticosteroid cream (such as hydrocortisone and others) may be prescribed. Corticosteroid tablets — prednisone (sold under several brand names) — may be used for severe reactions.\nAnaphylaxis, the most serious allergic reaction, can cause a dramatic fall in blood pressure, wheezing, and breathing difficulties. The most severe cases can lead to loss of consciousness and, rarely, death. Anaphylaxis is treated with an emergency injection of epinephrine (adrenaline) and fluids given intravenously (into a vein).\nSome drug allergies can be modified by treatment called drug desensitization\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Symptoms of an acute severe allergic reaction such as rapid pulse, labored breathing and facial swelling require an immediate visit to an emergency care facility. Other reactions should be reported promptly to your physician so that your treatment can be evaluated and you can avoid the medication that caused the reaction.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most drug allergies respond readily to stopping the offending agent. Because the allergy itself cannot be cured, treatment aims at controlling symptoms.\n",

      "What is melanoma?": "Melanoma is cancer of the cells (melanocytes) that give skin its color. It develops when these cells change and reproduce aggressively. The number of cases of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is increasing faster than any other cancer.\nDoctors aren't completely sure why melanoma rates are soaring. It could be from spending too much time in the sun during outdoor activities. It could also be due to global changes, such as the depletion of the ozone, which absorbs many of the sun's harmful rays.\nYour pattern of sun exposure appears to affect your risk of developing melanoma more than the total amount of sun exposure in your lifetime. Short bursts of intense sun seem most dangerous, especially if you get sunburned. Being out in the sun can cause changes (mutations) in skin cells' genes.\nThe most common type of melanoma spreads on the skin's surface. It is called superficial spreading melanoma. It may stay on the surface or grow down into deeper tissues. Other types of melanoma can start anywhere on or inside the body.\n\nYour risk of developing melanoma is higher if you have:\nFeatures of freckles or moles that raise your risk of melanoma include:\n",
      "Symptoms of melanoma": "Melanoma is usually visible as a single dark skin spot. It may appear anywhere on the body, but it most commonly develops on the back, chest, and legs. Most of the time, melanoma develops on normal-looking skin, but it can grow out of an existing mole.\nWatch a mole for theA, ,C,DandEs of melanoma:\nA mole that bleeds, feels numb, or has a crusty surface may also hint at melanoma.\n\n",
      "Diagnosing melanoma": "If your doctor thinks a mole may be melanoma, he or she will do a biopsy of the skin or refer you to a specialist for the procedure.\nBefore the biopsy, your doctor will check for enlarged lymph nodes close to the mole. If you have a melanoma, enlarged lymph nodes can mean that the cancer has spread. After a skin biopsy, nearby lymph nodes can swell because the skin incision is healing.\nIn a biopsy, a doctor removes a piece of tissue and examines it in a laboratory. Based on this report, your doctor can then determine the thickness of the melanoma and how deep the cancer has grown below the skin's surface. That's the most important factor in predicting whether it can be cured.\nMelanomas deeper than 1 millimeter are more likely to have spread to other parts of the body. Your doctor may suggest additional tests including:\nIf the cancer is advanced, the biopsy sample of your melanoma may be tested to see if it has one of the gene mutations common in melanoma. Some melanoma treatments have been designed to attack specific genetic subtypes of this cancer.\n",
      "Expected duration of melanoma": "Melanoma can usually be cured if it is removed when the tumor has not gone deep into the skin. More advanced melanoma requires longer treatment. If you have one melanoma, you are at risk of developing another, so have a doctor examine your skin regularly. About 1 out of 20 people who have a melanoma will develop a second melanoma within 20 years.\n",
      "Preventing melanoma": "To reduce your risk of melanoma, stay out of the sun. A bad sunburn is a major risk factor. Spending a lot of time in the sun as a child may pose the greatest risk. To be safe in the sun, take these steps:\nMelanoma is often easy to spot early, because it can be seen on your skin. If you are at risk of developing melanoma, ask your doctor to examine your skin. Also ask your doctor how often you should have your skin checked.\nYour doctor will pay special attention to any atypical looking moles. Because some melanomas can arise from existing moles, your doctor may remove atypical moles. These moles may be more likely to become cancerous. Alternatively, your doctor may take pictures of your moles. He or she can compare the photos to your moles in the future to see if they have changed.\nExamine your skin regularly, especially if you have risk factors for melanoma. Use a full-length and hand-held mirror. Have someone examine your scalp using a blow dryer to part your hair. That person can also examine your back and other areas that you can't easily see. Watch for new moles and changes in existing ones. Keep an eye on moles that you've had since birth; these moles may be more likely to turn into melanoma.\n",
      "Treating melanoma": "Major advances have been made in the treatment of melanoma.\nSurgery is the initial treatment for melanoma that appears in just one spot. The doctor removes the visible tumor along with 1 to 2.5 centimeters of healthy skin around the tumor, depending on the size of the tumor. (Nearby skin can contain microscopic bits of the cancer.)\nIn some cases, the doctor may perform a specialized procedure during which the tumor is shaved away one thin layer at a time. Each layer is examined under the microscope as it is removed. This technique helps the doctor remove as little healthy skin as possible.\nIf the melanoma is more than 1 millimeter deep, your doctor will want to know if the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes. To do this, he or she may inject a radioactive liquid into the tumor. The liquid flows through the natural drainage pathway that connects the tumor to nearby lymph nodes.\nThe drainage path can be tracked, and the first lymph node along the path is called the sentinel node. This node is removed and examined for cancer cells. If the sentinel node has no cancer, the other nodes are most often cancer-free.\nIf cancer is found in the sentinel node, most often all the lymph nodes in the area will be removed. However, it's not been absolutely proven that removing all lymph nodes improves survival. Although spreading cancer cells might be removed, cells that are fighting the cancer also are removed.\nWhen cancer has spread to one or two other sites only, surgical removal similar to what was done the first time can improve survival.\nAdditional therapies can often help people with thicker tumors that have grown deep into the skin and/or spread to more areas of the body. The cancer cells are tested for certain specific markers. The results guide the type of therapy that has the greatest chance of improving quality of life and survival.\nMost often patients are treated with immunotherapy and/or drugs designed to block major pathways that allow cancers to grow. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are less effective. But they can be used when other therapies don't work or stop working.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Early treatment of melanoma is crucial. If you detect any of theABCDEsigns or see any suspicious skin changes, call your doctor right away. If you delay, melanoma can spread. If melanoma runs in your family, of if you have other risk factors, be especially alert. Have your doctor examine your skin regularly.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Five key factors help to determine how serious melanoma is:\nThe thickness of the tumor is the most important factor in determining whether it can be treated. Tumors on the skin's surface usually can be cured. Deeper cancers are more difficult, sometimes impossible, to treat. If melanoma cells break away and spread to organs such as the lungs, liver or brain, the cancer can be cured in only a small number of patients.\nIf treatment begins when the tumor is less than 0.75 millimeters deep, the chance of a cure is excellent. More than 95% of people with small melanomas are cancer-free as long as 8 years later. However, for deeper melanomas, the survival rate is variable.\n",

      "What is melasma?": "Melasma is a condition in which areas of the skin become darker than the surrounding skin. Doctors call this hyperpigmentation. It typically occurs on the face, particularly the forehead, cheeks, and above the upper lip. The dark patches often appear on both sides of the face in a nearly identical pattern. The darker-colored patches of skin can be any shade, from tan to deep brown. Rarely, these dark patches may appear on other sun-exposed areas of the body.\nMelasma occurs much more often in women than in men, and usually is associated with hormonal changes. That is why the dark patches develop often during pregnancy, or if a woman is taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or oral contraceptives. Melasma during pregnancy is relatively common. Sometimes it is called the \"mask of pregnancy\" or \"chloasma.\" The dark patches typically last until the pregnancy ends.\nThe most important factor in the development of melasma is exposure to sunlight. Using medications that make you sensitive to the sun (photosensitizing) can increase your risk of developing melasma. These can include some cosmetics and medicines used to treat ovarian or thyroid problems. Protection from the sun is a necessary part of treatment of melasma. For example, women who are pregnant or who take a hormone medication and avoid the sun are less likely to develop melasma than are those who spend a lot of time in the sun.\n",
      "Symptoms of melasma": "Darker patches of skin appear on the forehead, temples, cheeks, or above the upper lip. The symptoms are strictly cosmetic — you won't feel ill, and the darker skin won't be sore.\n",
      "Diagnosing melasma": "A doctor will diagnose melasma simply by looking at your skin. Your medical history will help to determine any factors that may have caused the disorder.\nYour doctor may use a special lamp that gives off ultraviolet light. This allows the doctor to see patterns and depth of skin discoloration more clearly.\n",
      "Expected duration of melasma": "The dark patches typically last until the pregnancy ends or you stop taking the hormonal medications and protect from the sun. The patches gradually fade over many months. In some people, the discoloration never entirely disappears.\n",
      "Preventing melasma": "The best way to prevent melasma is to limit skin exposure to the sun. If you go out in the sun, take these preventive measures:\n",
      "Treating melasma": "As hormones stabilize, the dark patches of melasma usually fade. Women who develop melasma as a result of pregnancy often see the patches fade months after the baby is born. Women who take oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy often see the patches fade once they stop taking the medications.\nA few options may help fade or treat dark patches:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you develop any unexplained discoloration of the skin. Although melasma does not require treatment, a doctor can distinguish melasma from other skin disorders that may need to be treated.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Much of the discoloration will fade or disappear once hormones stabilize and you stay out of the sun. For people who find the discolorations unsightly, treatment may help to fade stubborn patches. You also can use cosmetics to even out the skin color.\n",

      "What is it?": "In Ménière's disease, fluid collects in the inner ear. Pressure from the buildup of fluid and damage to some of the delicate structures in the inner ear can cause a variety of symptoms that appear suddenly, without warning, and can last minutes to hours. Many people have only mild symptoms, but in others the symptoms are severe enough to be disabling. Hearing loss comes and goes, but over time some degree of hearing loss may become permanent.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The cause of Ménière's disease is unknown. It tends to strike men and women equally, and although it can occur at any age, it usually begins between the ages of 30 and 50. In most cases, only one ear is affected. Only about 15 percent of people with Ménière's disease lose hearing in both ears.\nThe symptoms of Meniere's disease vary considerably from person to person. Some patients experience a cluster of attacks for a few weeks followed by years of relief, and other patients experience symptoms regularly for years.\nA person with Ménière's disease may experience any or all of these symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing Ménière's disease can be difficult. Your doctor cannot examine the inner ear directly, so there is no simple way to tell if fluid has built up. Usually, your doctor will diagnose Ménière's disease if you experience the typical symptoms and other possible causes of the symptoms have been ruled out.\nYour doctor will start by taking a medical history, including information about past or current medical problems and medications that you take. He or she will ask you detailed questions about your symptoms, including when they started, how often and for how long they occur, and how disabling they are. Your doctor then will examine you, with a special focus on your ears, nose, throat and balance system.\nTests that may be used to aid in diagnosis include:\nIf the diagnosis remains uncertain, you may be referred to an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist) or neurologist.\n",
      "Expected duration": "There is no cure for Ménière's disease. Once the condition is diagnosed, it will remain for life. However, the symptoms typically come and go, and only some people with Ménière's disease will go on to develop permanent disabilities.\n",
      "Prevention": "Because no one knows what causes Ménière's disease, there is no way to prevent it.\n",
      "Treatment": "There is no cure for Ménière's disease, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms.\nDifferent types of medications may be used to control various symptoms, including\nMany physicians also recommend avoiding caffeine, alcohol, salt and nicotine to reduce the frequency or severity of attacks. These lifestyle changes may or may not help, but they are worth trying.\nIn severe cases, your doctor may recommend injections of gentamicin into the middle ear. A side effect of gentamicin (a potent intravenous antibiotic) is damage to the balance mechanism inside the ear. By selectively destroying the balance part of the ear, the condition may actually improve. Single to multiple injections may be necessary to damage the inner ear enough to stop the vertigo episodes. The injections can be performed in the office.\nYour doctor may recommend surgery if symptoms of vertigo are severe or frequent. Different surgical procedures are available, each with pros and cons. For example, some types of surgery require your doctor to destroy parts of the inner ear, which can cause permanent hearing loss. If you are considering surgery, be sure to talk to your doctor about the possible risks and benefits. Surgical procedures that may be recommended in severe cases include:\nNo treatment can prevent the hearing loss that occurs in Ménière's disease.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "It is usually difficult to ignore an attack of Ménière's disease. See your health care professional if you experience an unexplained spinning or dizzy sensation or if you experience hearing loss.\n",
      "Prognosis": "There is no cure for Ménière's disease. Over time, some degree of permanent hearing loss is common.\nHowever, the worst symptoms of vertigo, nausea and vomiting often can be controlled. By working closely with their physicians, people with Ménière's disease often can find the right combination of lifestyle changes and medication to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Patients with severe, disabling symptoms may get relief with surgery, but the risks and benefits need to be weighed carefully.\n",

      "What is it?": "Meningitis is an inflammation of coverings (meninges) of the brain and spinal cord. Most often it is caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Other infectious agents such as fungi can also cause meningitis. Rarer causes of meningitis include atypical drug reactions and systemic lupus erythematosus.\nAnyone can get viral meningitis, but it occurs more often in children. While many different viruses can cause meningitis, an enterovirus tends to be the usual culprit.\nViral meningitis due to enterovirus peaks in mid-summer through early autumn. But it can occur any time of the year. Except for the rare case of herpes meningitis, viral meningitis will resolve on its own after seven to 10 days.\nBacterial meningitis, formerly called spinal meningitis, is a very serious and potentially fatal infection. It can strike very healthy people, but infants and older people are more susceptible. In the past, the three most common types of bacterial meningitis were caused byNeisseria meningitidis,Haemophilus influenzaandStreptococcus pneumoniae. Now that we have very effective vaccines to help prevent all three types, bacterial meningitis in otherwise healthy children and adults occurs less often.\nBesides infants and the elderly, people with chronic diseases and/or impaired immune systems have the greatest risk of meningitis caused by bacteria and fungi.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of meningitis vary, but often include\nOther symptoms may include\nSymptoms may be milder in cases of viral meningitis, while in cases of bacterial meningitis, symptoms may come on quite suddenly. In very young children, symptoms may be particularly hard to detect. Babies with meningitis may be less active, vomit, refuse to eat, or be irritable. A person in later stages of bacterial meningitis may have seizures and lose consciousness (pass out).\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Meningitis is diagnosed by testing some of the fluid that surrounds the spinal cord for disease-causing bacteria or infection-fighting cells. The fluid is removed from the spinal cord with a needle in a procedure known as a spinal tap or lumbar puncture.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Viral meningitis tends to get better on its own in seven to 10 days. In contrast, if bacterial meningitis is not diagnosed and treated early, it can cause permanent disability or death. The length of time that medication is needed for bacterial meningitis depends on the person's age, response to the medication, and other factors.\n",
      "Prevention": "The bacteria and viruses that cause meningitis are found in bodily fluids, such as saliva and mucus, and are spread by direct contact. Some people carry the germs in their nose and throat and can pass them on to other people, even though these \"carriers\" are not sick. If you are in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, you may be given antibiotics to prevent you from getting the disease.\nVaccination againstStreptococcus pneumoniae(pneumonia shot), Haemophilus influenzaeandNeisseria meningitidisis the best way to prevent bacterial meningitis.\nThere is no vaccine to prevent the common types of viral meningitis.\n",
      "Treatment": "Viral meningitis is treated much like the flu, with rest and plenty of fluids, and you should recover in a week to 10 days. Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. It requires high-dose intravenous antibiotics in a hospital setting. Depending upon the patient and suspected type of bacterial meningitis, intravenous dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, may be given at the time of diagnosis.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you or your child is exhibiting symptoms of meningitis, contact your doctor immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "For most people with viral meningitis, the outlook is excellent.\nThe prognosis for bacterial meningitis depends on the person's age, which bacterium is causing the disease, and how early the disease was diagnosed.\n",

      "What are menopause and perimenopause?": "Most women think of menopause as the time of life when their menstrual periods end. This usually occurs during middle age, when women are also experiencing other hormonal and physical changes. For this reason, menopause is sometimes called the \"change of life.\"\nA woman is said to be in menopause after she has gone for one full year without periods. While most women in the United States go through menopause around the age of 51, a small number will experience menopause as early as age 40 or as late as their late 50s. Rarely, menopause occurs after age 60. When menopause is diagnosed before age 40, it is considered to be abnormal or premature menopause.\nIn women, the ovaries produce the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen and progesterone control a woman's periods and other processes in her body. As a woman approaches menopause, her ovaries gradually makes less and less of these hormones.\nAs hormone levels fall, a woman's pattern of menstrual bleeding usually becomes irregular. Many women experience light, skipped or late periods for several months to a year before their periods stop altogether. Some women may experience heavier-than-normal bleeding. Heavier-than-normal bleeding should be evaluated by a doctor to exclude problems in the genital tract.\nIt is important to realize that until menopause is complete, a woman still can become pregnant even when periods are light or missed.\nFor most women, menopause is a normal process of aging. If a woman has had her ovaries removed by surgery or has had damage to her ovaries for other reasons, such as radiation therapy, she may become menopausal from that process.\nPerimenopause, also known as the climacteric, includes the time before menopause when hormonal and biological changes and physical symptoms begin to occur. This period lasts for an average of three to five years.\n",
      "Symptoms of menopause and perimenopause": "Some women don't have any symptoms during menopause or only have a few symptoms. Others develop disturbing and even severe, disabling symptoms. Studies of women around the world suggest that differences in lifestyle, diet and activity may play a role in the severity and type of symptoms women have during menopause. Symptoms can be noticed for several months to years before the last menstrual period and can continue for several years after.\nSymptoms of menopause or perimenopause include:\n",
      "Diagnosing menopause and perimenopause": "For most women, the diagnosis of menopause is made based on a woman's description of her symptoms and the ending of her menstrual periods. Laboratory testing is not usually needed.\nBecause women can still become pregnant while they are perimenopausal, doctors may do a pregnancy test when a woman's periods become irregular, infrequent or light. In some cases, a blood test for levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may be recommended. FSH levels are normally high in menopause, so high FSH levels can help to confirm that a woman is in menopause.\nAt the time of menopause, doctors often recommend a bone density measurement. The test result sometimes will detect early osteoporosis. More often the result is used as a baseline to compare rate of bone loss in the future.\nAnother test is endometrial biopsy. An endometrial biopsy is an office procedure in which a tiny piece of endometrial tissue from inside the uterus is taken and examined under a microscope for signs of cancer. This test may be done when a woman is having irregular, frequent or heavy bleeding, but it is not routinely recommended as a test for menopause.\n",
      "Expected duration of menopause and perimenopause": "Perimenopause usually lasts three to five years but it can take as few as two years or as many as eight years for some women. The changes in the body that occur during menopause last for the rest of a woman's life. However hot flashes usually improve over time, becoming less frequent and less severe.\n",
      "Preventing menopause and perimenopause": "Menopause is a natural event and cannot be prevented. Medications, diet and exercise can prevent or eliminate some symptoms of menopause and enhance a woman's quality of life as she grows older.\n",
      "Treating menopause and perimenopause": "",
      "Lifestyle changes": "Diet, exercise and lifestyle changes can reduce the symptoms and complications of menopause. The following recommendations are appropriate for all women who are approaching menopause or who are in menopause.\nExercise to prevent weak or thin bones must be weight-bearing exercise such as walking, low-impact aerobics, dancing, lifting weights, or playing a racquet sport such as tennis or paddle ball. Exercise does not need to be vigorous to help. Walking a few miles per day helps to maintain bone mass.\n",
      "Medication therapy": "A number of medications are used to treat the symptoms of menopause. The type of medication needed is a complicated decision and each woman should discuss the issue with her doctor. The treatment will depend on what symptoms are most bothersome and how bothersome they are.\nEstrogen taken as a pill or applied to the skin as a patch can reduce hot flashes, sleep disturbances, mood changes and vaginal dryness. Estrogen can be prescribed alone when a woman no longer has her uterus. A combination of estrogen and progesterone is used when a woman still has her uterus. Progesterone is necessary to balance estrogen's effect on the uterus and prevent changes that can lead to uterine cancer.\nHowever, evidence has shown that there are some risks associated with the use of these medicines. Estrogen therapy can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots in a small number of women. On the other hand, it prevents fractures and can decrease the risk of colon cancer. Therefore, the decision to use hormone replacement therapy to treat symptoms of menopause is an individual decision. A woman should talk to her doctor about the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy for her.\nThere are several other medications that can be used to treat hot flashes:\nSeveral alternative treatments have been proposed to treat the symptoms of menopause. Many of these treatments have not been studied in large clinical trials. Although black cohosh has been previously promoted as a treatment for hot flashes, well-done medical studies conclude the root is no more effective than a placebo.\nSome women have found St. John's wort to be effective in treating mood disorders related to menopause.\nThe use of soy products in the diet such as tofu is controversial. While it may improve symptoms for some women, the phytoestrogens (plant estrogens) that may help relieve hot flashes may also increase the risk of breast cancer.\nScientific studies have found no benefit to the use of vitamin E or primrose oil. No evidence has been found to support the use of acupuncture or homeopathy, but few studies of these therapies have been done.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should see your doctor if you have any of the following:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although menopause can cause some uncomfortable symptoms, both lifestyle practices and medication can help to ease these symptoms and complications.\n",

      "What is it?": "A metastatic brain tumor is cancer that has spread (metastasized) from another part of the body to the brain. It is also called a secondary tumor, lesion, or brain metastasis (plural: metastases). In contrast, a primary brain tumor starts in the brain, not in another part of the body.\nA tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue. It occurs when cells divide more than they should or don't die when they should.\nCancers that spread to the brain can originate in any part of the body. The original tumor is called the primary tumor. Metastatic brain tumors most commonly originate in the lung, breast, skin, colon, and kidney. A very aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma often spreads to the brain.\nBrain metastases occur when cancer cells break away from a primary tumor. They travel to the brain, usually through the bloodstream. These cancer cells may settle in the brain and continue growing. Sometimes only one secondary brain tumor occurs. But in many cases there are multiple lesions.\nThe brain is a complex organ enclosed in the skull. Among other things, it serves as the body's center of\n",
      "Symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of secondary brain tumors depend on their size and location. This is because different parts of the brain control different functions.\nAs a tumor grows, it can press against or destroy normal brain tissue. It can also increase pressure inside the skull.\nSigns and symptoms of brain metastases include\nThese symptoms are not necessarily signs of brain metastases. But it is important to contact your doctor if you experience any of them.\nSome people with metastatic brain tumors don't show any symptoms. However, over time, the brain metastases will continue to grow, eventually causing symptoms.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The first step in diagnosis is usually a physical exam. Your doctor will check for general signs of disease. He or she will also ask about your health habits and past illnesses and treatments.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to determine whether you have cancer that has spread to your brain.\nNeurological and visual exams.These tests assess your mental and physical abilities, including\nTumor marker test.A sample of blood, urine, or tissue is taken. Levels of certain substances that may indicate the presence of cancer are measured.\nImaging tests:\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap).Assuming it can be done safely, the doctor may want to remove cerebral spinal fluid from the lower back with a needle in some cases. The fluid is then checked for cancer cells.\nAngiogram.A contrast dye is injected into the bloodstream and x-rays are taken. This allows the doctor to examine blood vessels and blood flow in the brain. It may identify blockages such as tumors. However, this procedure is less common than in the past because MRI can often provide the same information.\nBiopsy.A small piece of tumor tissue is removed for examination. The tumor tissue may be tested for certain substances that provoke an immune response. It will also be analyzed for changes in the cells and their genetic material.\nBiopsy can be done using a needle inserted through a hole in the skull. Or it may be done during surgery to remove a tumor.\nSometimes a biopsy can't be done safely because of the tumor location. In this case, the doctor uses imaging and other tests to make the diagnosis.\nSometimes the primary cancer is discovered after the patient is diagnosed with metastatic brain tumors. If brain lesions are the first sign of cancer, various imaging tests may be done to search for the primary tumor.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Primary cancers spread to the brain at different rates. For example, lung cancer tends to spread to the brain much sooner than many other cancers. The tumors will continue to grow until they are treated.\n",
      "Prevention": "Some metastatic brain tumors develop from common cancers that begin in organs. Surgeons may be able to remove part or all of such tumors. Therefore, surgery is one way to prevent a cancer from spreading to the brain.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment for metastatic brain tumors may include surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and/or chemotherapy.\nThe treatment approach depends on the\nWhether the patient received chemotherapy and the response will also influence decisions about treatment.\n",
      "Surgery": "Some patients have only one secondary brain tumor that can be easily reached. In this case, surgery is the preferred treatment.\nSurgery removes or reduces the size of the tumor. It can also help ease symptoms caused by pressure and swelling in the brain. This is true even if the tumor is not removed completely.\n",
      "Radiation therapy": "Radiation therapy is typically recommended when\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy x-ray beams to damage or destroy tumor cells. It is usually delivered by a machine outside the body. This is called external beam radiation. Different types of radiation therapy may be given individually or together.\nWhole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) delivers an even dose of radiation to the entire brain. Side effects may include\nIn addition, dead tumor cells may build up in the brain.\nRadiosurgery (also called stereotactic radiosurgery) is a more targeted procedure. It delivers radiation beams to a precise location in the brain. Despite its name, radiosurgery does not involve surgery. It is less likely than whole brain radiation to harm healthy brain tissue. It typically causes fewer side effects, too.\n",
      "Immunotherapy": "Certain cancers that have spread to the brain have shown responses to immunotherapy. Some patients with brain metastases from melanoma and lung cancer have had clinically significant improvement with this therapy.\n",
      "Chemotherapy": "Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells. For most types of metastatic brain cancer, it is less effective than surgery or radiation. Significant side effects are more likely to occur if the patient receives both radiation and chemotherapy.\n",
      "Symptom relief": "Medicines and other therapies may help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. They include\nWhen you are considering a treatment option, ask your doctor about the risks and potential benefits. How will this treatment affect my prognosis? What will my quality of life be during and after treatment?\nNew therapies for metastatic brain tumors are being tested in clinical trials. You may want to consider joining a clinical trial if you find one that fits your medical and personal situation.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if you experience symptoms of metastatic brain tumors, including\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for patients with brain metastases depends on\nPeople with secondary tumors that began with breast cancer have a better outlook than those with other types of primary cancer.\nCancer can be fatal even if it does not spread. However, most people who die of cancer have metastases.\n",

      "What is mid-menstrual cycle pain?": "Some women feel pain in the abdomen or pelvis during ovulation, when an egg is released from the ovary. This usually happens midway between menstrual cycles. The medical term for this is mittelschmerz, which comes from the German words for \"middle\" and \"pain.\" Some women don't feel anything when an egg is being released from an ovary. Other women may feel intermittent or constant discomfort or pain during ovulation.\n",
      "Symptoms of mid-menstrual cycle pain": "Ovulation usually occurs two weeks before the first day of each menstrual period, give or take a couple of days. During this time, you may feel pain in the pelvis that can range from a sense of discomfort or a mild twinge to severe pain that mimics appendicitis. It usually lasts a short period of time, from a few minutes to hours. It often is felt in the lower abdomen or pelvis, either in the middle or on one side. If the pain is severe, it may be accompanied by some mild nausea.\n",
      "Diagnosing mid-menstrual cycle pain": "Pain during ovulation usually is easy to recognize because its timing is so characteristic. Your doctor will be able to determine that you are experiencing pain from ovulation based on your menstrual cycle, the location and description of your pain, and the results of an abdominal and pelvic exam. It is important to let your doctor know about any other symptoms you have, such as fever, vomiting, changes in urination or changes in your bowel movements or appetite.\nAdditional blood tests, X-rays, a pelvic ultrasound or a computed tomography (CT) scan may be necessary if your pain is severe or if your doctor notices any unusual findings on your physical examination, such as a very tender abdomen or pelvis or an enlarged ovary.\n",
      "Expected duration of mid-menstrual cycle pain": "Ovulatory pain usually lasts from a few moments to several hours. The longer episodes of pain may be due to lingering irritation from a small amount of bleeding, which sometimes happens when the egg is released.\n",
      "Preventing mid-menstrual cycle pain": "It usually is not necessary to prevent this mild, short-lived pain syndrome. Birth control pills prevent ovulation and can be used to prevent mid-cycle pain.\n",
      "Treating mid-menstrual cycle pain": "Painful ovulation is generally brief, so using medication for pain relief usually is not necessary. Over-the-counter pain medicines, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others), can be used as needed and are very effective at relieving mid-menstrual cycle pain.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have fever, pain with urination, abnormal bleeding or vomiting, even if your pain happens exactly at time of ovulation. Let your doctor know if mid-cycle pain lasts longer than a day. You also should contact your doctor if you missed your last menstrual period.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Pain during ovulation does not have any dangerous consequences.\n",

      "What is it?": "The middle ear is the space behind the eardrum, which is connected to the back of the throat by a passageway called the eustachian tube. Middle-ear infections, also called otitis media, can occur when congestion from an allergy or cold blocks the eustachian tube. Fluid and pressure build up, so bacteria or viruses that have traveled up the eustachian tube into the middle ear can multiply and cause an ear infection.\nMiddle-ear infections are the most common illness that brings children to a pediatrician and the most common cause of hearing loss in children. Middle-ear infections can also cause a hole (perforation) in the eardrum or spread to nearby areas, such as the mastoid bone. Adults also can get middle-ear infections.\nChildren in day care have an increased risk of middle-ear infections. The increased exposure to other infected children increases your child's chances of getting infected.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The most common symptoms of a middle-ear infection are pain and decreased hearing. Inside the middle ear, three tiny bones (ossicles) normally transfer sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear, where they are turned into nerve impulses that your brain understands as sound. In people with otitis media, however, inflammation and infection may change this normal process. Other symptoms can include fever, headache, general body discomfort, rubbing or pulling of the ears in children, vomiting and diarrhea in infants, dizziness, loss of balance, and fluid draining from the ear.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about ear pain, any discharge from the ear, and fever. He or she will examine the ears with an otoscope — an instrument with a lighted, cone-shaped end piece for looking in the ear canal at the eardrum. The doctor will look for redness and bulging of the eardrum and will check to see if it moves normally by blowing a puff of air through the otoscope. (Eardrums do not move if they are too stiff or if there is fluid behind them.) Your doctor may also do a hearing test called an audiogram to check for hearing problems or a test called a tympanogram that measures how the eardrum moves.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Symptoms of otitis media usually improve within 48 to 72 hours, but the fluid that has built up in the middle ear may last for up to three months.\n",
      "Prevention": "You may be able to lower your child's risk of otitis media by doing the following:\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of a middle-ear infection depends on how bad the symptoms are and what's causing the infection. Many infections will go away on their own, and the only treatment necessary is medication for pain. Up to 80% of ear infections may go away without antibiotics. Antibiotics are prescribed for any child younger than 6 months and for any person with severe symptoms. Sometimes a doctor will write a prescription for antibiotics but will ask the patient or family to wait 48 to 72 hours before filling it, to see if symptoms improve.\nIn cases of particularly severe infections or those that do not respond to treatment, a tube may need to be inserted through the eardrum. This is done by a specialist in illnesses of the ears, nose, and throat (an otolaryngologist), usually under anesthesia. If enlarged adenoids or tonsils cause recurrent or persistent infections, the specialist may recommend surgery to remove them.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you or your older child complains of an earache or has trouble hearing. If your baby child has a fever, is unusually irritable, or can't sleep, frequently rubs or pulls his or her ears, has vomiting or diarrhea, or does not respond normally to sounds (doesn't startle when a door slams or pots clang), call your doctor promptly.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook in most people with a middle-ear infection is very good. The infection and its symptoms usually go away completely. In severe cases that go untreated, the infection can spread, causing an infection in the mastoid bone (called mastoiditis) or even meningitis, but this is rare. Hearing difficulties can occur. While they are not necessarily permanent, they can affect the speech and language development of younger children.\n",

      "What is it?": "Migraine is a very common, but very particular, type of headache. Most people who have migraine experience repeated attacks of headaches that occur over many years. The typical migraine headache is throbbing or pulsating, and often is associated with nausea and changes in vision. While many migraine headaches are severe, not all severe headaches are migraines, and some episodes can be quite mild.\nUp to 20% of people in the United States will experience migraine headaches at some point in life. In about half of those, migraine headaches first appear during childhood or adolescence. Two-thirds of people who get migraines are women, probably because of the influence of hormones. Migraines also tend to run in families.\nThe pain of migraines is associated with swelling in blood vessels and irritation of nerves that surround the brain, but these features do not explain what causes migraine. Instead, many experts now believe that cortical spreading depression is the likely inciting phenomenon. Altered electrical waves start to spread slowly across the brain, triggering a complex reaction involving the trigeminal nerve and its surrounding tissues.\nScientists have discovered an array of chemicals released during a migraine attack. Some of these substances have provided potential targets for new therapies.\nThe brain chemical serotonin may play a role in this process as it does in other conditions, including depression and eating disorders.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A migraine usually is a throbbing headache that occurs on one or both sides of the head. The headache typically is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite. Activity, bright light, or loud noises can make the headache worse, so someone having a migraine often seeks out a cool, dark, quiet place. Most migraines last from four to 12 hours, although they can be shorter or much longer. One unique feature of migraines is an unusual sensation that a migraine is about to occur. This sensation is called a prodrome. Prodrome symptoms can include fatigue, hunger, and nervousness. Migraines also have typical aftereffects, such as a feeling of exhaustion that lasts a day or two after a severe migraine headache has faded. Not all people who get migraines have prodromes or aftereffects.\nAnother unique feature of migraines is an aura. In a typical aura, a person suddenly will develop blurry or distorted vision or will see pulsating lights. These changes in vision will come and go over 15 to 30 minutes and alert someone that a headache is about to begin. Sometimes, auras affect the sense of hearing, smell, or taste. Only some people who get migraines have auras, and they don't accompany every headache. An aura also can occur without being followed by a headache. Rarely, migraines can cause unusual neurological symptoms such as dizziness, loss of vision, passing out, numbness, weakness, or tingling.\nMigraines can be triggered by certain activities, foods, smells, or emotions. Some people are more likely to experience migraines when they are under stress, while others develop migraines when stress is relieved (for example, the day after exams or an important meeting). Women who have migraines often find that their headaches occur or worsen around the time of their menstrual periods.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A doctor usually will diagnose migraine based on your history and symptoms. In most cases, a physical and neurological examination will be entirely normal.\nThere are no special tests to diagnose migraines. For example, a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain usually will be normal. However, your doctor may recommend additional testing if your headaches have features that are not typical for migraines, or if you develop other worrisome symptoms. If there is any doubt about your diagnosis, your doctor also may recommend a consultation with a neurologist, a doctor specializing in illnesses of the nerves and brain.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Migraine headaches can last from a few hours to a few days. A typical migraine sufferer will have several headaches each month. However, some people have only one attack in a lifetime, while others have more than three attacks per week.\n",
      "Prevention": "Not all migraine headaches can be prevented. However, identifying your headache triggers can help to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. Common migraine triggers include\nEven if you avoid all possible triggers, you are still likely to experience a migraine occasionally. And many people who get migraines have frequent and severe headaches no matter how well they avoid triggers.\nOther methods some people have used to decrease their migraine attacks include biofeedback, yoga, acupuncture, massage, and regular exercise.\n",
      "Treatment": "How your migraines are treated will depend on the frequency and severity of attacks. People who have a headache several times per year often respond well to nonprescription pain relievers. However, other therapies should be considered when headaches are disabling enough to interfere with usual activities and pain relievers don't work well.\nThere are two types of medications to treat migraines — drugs that are taken when a headache starts (called abortive medications) and drugs that are taken every day to prevent migraines (called preventive medications). The decision of whether to take a daily preventive medication or abortive medications is a personal choice. In the past, daily preventive medication was prescribed when a person had an average of two or more migraines per month. Today, reasons for prescribing preventive medication include\n",
      "Abortive medications": "When possible, an abortive medication should be taken immediately after an aura or migraine headache starts. This can be a challenge for people with frequent auras or headaches because overusing abortive medications can lead to chronic daily headache, a headache disorder that describes headaches that occur day after day without a specific cause or diagnosis.\nSeveral nonprescription drugs and some relatively inexpensive prescription drugs are available. Aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and other brand names), or naproxen (Aleve) taken at the earliest warning may be enough to stop a full-blown headache. Drug combinations often work better than drugs with a single active ingredient. One popular remedy for migraines is the combination of aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine (Excedrin) taken once or twice per month when symptoms occur.\nOther medications require a prescription. Examples include isometheptene (Midrin and other brand names); medications called triptans, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex), naratriptan (Amerge), zolmitriptan (Zomig), and rizatriptan (Maxalt); and medications called ergotamines, such as sublingual ergotamine (Ergomar) and dihydroergotamine (Migranal). In addition, people who experience nausea with or without vomiting also can take an anti-nausea pill or suppository.\nA newer class of drugs for migraine called CGRP antagonists (inhibitors), also known as gepants, work by blocking specific CGRP pain receptors in the nervous system. Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy) and rimegepant (Nurtec) are oral medications that can be taken for acute migraine treatment. The nasal spray Zavzpret containing the gepant called zavegepant is also available for pain relief.\nIf the headache becomes more intense and does not respond to one or two doses of an abortive medication, other pain relievers can be used to lessen the discomfort. The type and amount of pain reliever you should take varies depending on how you responded to the medication previously and how much other medication you took when the headache started.\n",
      "Preventive medications": "Many drugs are listed as potentially useful to prevent recurrent migraine attacks. The following are prescribed most frequently:\nSome people with migraine have very frequent headaches, sometimes every day. This form of migraine, called chronic migraine, is difficult to treat. Your doctor may recommend a trial of Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA). The doctor gives multiple injections around the head and neck once every 12 weeks. It is approved for people that experience migraine headaches more than 14 days per month.\nYour doctor may discuss the newer preventive therapies for people with very frequent attacks or chronic migraine. They are known as CGRP antagonists, such as galcanezumab (Emgality), erenumab (Aimovig), and fremanuzumab (Ajovy). You inject one of these medicines, usually monthly, under your skin.\nPreventive medications (except for Botox injections) need to be taken every day to be effective. In choosing which medication to try first, you and your doctor will evaluate the benefits and the possible side effects. For example, if you have both high blood pressure and migraine, a calcium-channel blocker or beta blocker might be the best choice to treat both. However, if you have asthma, your doctor might not prescribe a beta blocker.\nDon't be discouraged if your first choice of preventive medication does not meet your expectations. You and your doctor may need to try three or four different strategies to find the best one for you.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have a history of migraine, you should contact your doctor if you develop headaches that differ from your usual headache or other migraine symptoms. Examples include\nIn addition, you may want to see your health care professional if you have headaches that do not get better with over-the-counter medications, severe headaches that interrupt work or the enjoyment of daily activities, or daily headaches.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people who develop migraines will continue to have intermittent headaches over many years. However, many people learn to control or to live with their headaches. In addition, migraines often diminish when people reach their 50s or 60s.\n",

      "What is a miscarriage?": "A miscarriage is a loss of a pregnancy. The term is generally used when the loss occurs before 20 weeks of gestation. Other terms that are used for such losses include spontaneous abortion and early pregnancy failure.\nAbout 15% to 20% of known pregnancies end in a miscarriage. Most miscarriages happen before the pregnancy is 12 weeks along. In the first several weeks of a pregnancy, a miscarriage sometimes happens because a fertilized egg did not properly form a fetus. In many cases, the activity of the fetal heart stopped days or weeks before the symptoms of miscarriage began.\nA common sign of miscarriage is bleeding, although not all pregnancies with bleeding end in miscarriage.\nIn the years before ultrasound, a miscarriage was usually diagnosed after bleeding had started and the process of expelling the pregnancy had begun. Today, ultrasound may identify pregnancy loss before the body has begun the process of expulsion. Sometimes this finding is called an early pregnancy failure.\nMiscarriages and possible miscarriages are categorized in several ways:\nIf a pregnancy ends after 20 weeks, it is usually not labeled a miscarriage even though it is a pregnancy loss. The term stillbirth is generally used when a fetus is delivered beyond 20 weeks but is not living.\nProblems with fetal chromosomes account for approximately 50% of all miscarriages. Chromosomes are long strings of DNA, each containing thousands of genes. Genes, in turn provide the instructions for the proteins and other molecules that create, shape and govern our bodies and health.\nIn most cases, the abnormalities of chromosomes that caused a miscarriage do not reflect any abnormality in either parent. Instead they reflect problems that developed at the time the egg or sperm developed, or at the time when fertilization and early division of the fertilized egg took place. In these case, where the miscarriage is related to chromosomal abnormalities, many think of it as the body's way of ending a pregnancy that is not developing normally.\nIn some unusual circumstances, miscarriages can happen if there are problems with the internal structure of a woman's uterus or the function of her cervix.\nInfections such as rubella (German measles) have been associated with miscarriage. This has led some to wonder if there are other infections that cause early pregnancy loss, but few links have been confirmed. Some experts have also suggested that hormonal imbalances can result in miscarriage, but identifying specific abnormalities has proven difficult.\nIn rare cases, a woman's immune system appears to react with the pregnancy tissue, resulting in miscarriage. Overall, immune system disorders seem to be responsible for very few miscarriages, but among women who have had three or more miscarriages in a row (recurrent miscarriage), immune-system disorders are responsible for 5% to 10% of these losses.\nOne fairly common antibody problem that can lead to recurrent miscarriage is called antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\nAnother example of an immune related issue associated with miscarriage is the production of antibodies that react to the thyroid gland (thyroperoxidase antibodies). How or if thyroid antibodies cause a pregnancy loss is not known. It may be that these antibodies are simply an indicator of other, as yet undiscovered, factors that are present.\nTesting for such antibodies after several miscarriages is often suggested. Some but not all studies suggest that for women with multiple miscarriages, treatment for the antibody disorders may decrease the risk of future miscarriage.\nAs frustrating as it may be, in many cases, no cause for a miscarriage is identified. Future research may identify the missing signal in fertilization or development and implantation that leads to miscarriage in such cases.\n",
      "Symptoms of miscarriage": "Symptoms of miscarriage include:\nIn addition to the possibility of miscarriage, pain or vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can be caused by other problems, such as a tubal (ectopic) pregnancy. These symptoms should always prompt an immediate call to your doctor, midwife or nurse practitioner.\n",
      "Diagnosing miscarriage": "If miscarriage is suspected or has occurred, an ultrasound and pelvic exam are usually performed. Your doctor, midwife or nurse will do a pelvic examination to check the size of your uterus and determine whether your cervix is open or closed. If a miscarriage is in progress, the cervix is usually open and the pregnancy will not survive. If a miscarriage has already happened, the cervix can be either open or closed, depending on whether all the pregnancy tissue has passed out of the womb.\nBlood tests are usually done to verify your blood type and check the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), a hormone released by the placenta into your body when you are pregnant. If the amount of the pregnancy hormone in your system is low or if repeated tests show the level has decreased over time or is not rising as much as expected, this is a sign you may have had a miscarriage.\nIn many cases when symptoms indicate a miscarriage, the evaluation will include or even start with an ultrasound. An ultrasound is used to identify if a pregnancy tissue is present within the uterus, if an early fetus can be seen (the so-called fetal pole) and/or if the fetal heart is beating. Together with the results of blood tests, ultrasound results can help your doctor evaluate the health of a pregnancy and consider other diagnoses such as tubal pregnancy.\n",
      "Expected duration of miscarriage": "Once bleeding has started and a miscarriage has begun or a loss has been diagnosed (for example, an incomplete or missed miscarriage), it is difficult to predict how long bleeding will continue and how long it will take for all the tissue to pass, or even if it will all pass without assistance.\nIn many cases, all the pregnancy tissue will pass without intervention. But there likely will be heavy bleeding and strong cramps. These symptoms will significantly decrease and then, over a period of one to two weeks, stop entirely. Miscarriages that occur in the second trimester may be followed by a longer time of bleeding.\nWhen medications or procedures are used to remove the tissue, the specific treatments used and their timing will determine the duration of symptoms.\n",
      "Preventing miscarriage": "If a miscarriage is about to occur, you cannot prevent it. In the past, if there were bleeding early in a pregnancy and the diagnosis of a threatened miscarriage was made, reduced activity or even bed rest would be recommended. Now, most doctors recognize that there is no evidence that such measures, or indeed any intervention, reduce the risk of miscarriage once symptoms have begun. Note that miscarriage is not caused by regular physical activities, minor accidents, exercise, sexual intercourse, or minor stumbles or falls.\nHowever, you may be able to decrease your chances of having a miscarriage in a future pregnancy by taking good care of yourself, eating a healthy diet, taking folic acid supplements, exercising regularly, and not smoking. If at the start of pregnancy you have any medical conditions, it's best to work with your doctor to create a treatment plan that keeps you and the fetus as safe and healthy as possible.\nIf you have had recurrent miscarriages, your doctor may recommend that you and your partner undergo a detailed evaluation to help identify, if possible, reasons for recurrent miscarriage. In addition, there is some evidence that taking daily low-dose (81 mg) aspirin daily while you are trying to get pregnant may decrease the risk of miscarriage.\n",
      "Treating miscarriage": "If you have a missed or incomplete miscarriage early in pregnancy, there are three options for management.\nThe first option involves what is often termed expectant management: watching carefully for problems but letting tissues pass on their own.\nIf bleeding is heavy, pain severe, or expectant management is unappealing, you and your obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN) may choose a procedure called a dilation and curettage (D&C) to gently stretch open your cervix and remove any remaining fetal tissue from your uterus.\nA third option for managing first-trimester losses involves using a combination of medicines to promote the passage of tissue. This last option means less time spent waiting than with expectant management, and in most cases avoids procedures such as D&C.\nYou and your providers can discuss which option is best for you.\nFor losses after the first trimester (first 12 weeks), the size of pregnancy tissues are generally too big to pass easily on their own or with the assistance of medications. So, D&C is often recommended.\nRarely, induction of labor may be recommended. This is more likely if the cervix is already widely opened or if loss occurs closer to 20 weeks. Such second-trimester procedures (particularly induction of labor) may require a longer stay in the hospital than that needed to manage a first-trimester loss.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call the health care professional who is monitoring your pregnancy immediately if you have symptoms of a miscarriage, such as vaginal bleeding or persistent pain in your pelvis, abdomen or back.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Your chances of having another miscarriage depend on the cause of your first miscarriage. Because, as noted above, miscarriages occur in 15% to 20% of pregnancies, even a healthy couple has a 15% to 20% chance of a miscarriage in any pregnancy. In such cases the risk of a miscarriage in a next pregnancy is similar: 15% to 20%.\nThe general recommendation for attempting pregnancy after a miscarriage is to wait about two to three months before trying to conceive again, but if conception occurs sooner, there is not any marked increase in risk. For many, the answer to the question when to try again is related not to one's body, but to the emotional recovery after enduring the loss of miscarriage.\nIt's normal and common to feel sad, grief-stricken, and depressed after a miscarriage. Your doctor can suggest resources for support during this difficult time.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Mitral valve prolapse is a malfunction of the heart's mitral valve, the physical doorway between the heart's left atrium and left ventricle. Normally, the mitral valve closes when the ventricle's muscles contract, preventing blood from flowing back into the left atrium when the heart pumps blood to the rest of the body. In mitral valve prolapse, however, a slight deformity of the mitral valve prevents the valve from closing normally. This appears as an abnormal floppiness, or prolapse, of the valve. The result is that small amounts of blood leak back into the left atrium, with very little effect on the heart's overall ability to pump blood.\n\nIn some people, the leak worsens to create a significant backflow of blood into the left atrium. This is called mitral regurgitation. People with severe mitral regurgitation can develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue and leg swelling. Rarely, heart surgery is needed to repair the damaged valve.\nIn most people with mitral valve prolapse, the cause is unknown. However, in a small number of patients, mitral valve prolapse may be related to another medical condition, such as an inherited abnormality in the way the body produces collagen (connective tissue) or rheumatic heart disease (a rare complication of strep throat).\nHealth experts estimate that mitral valve prolapse currently affects up to 5% of people in the United States. For unknown reasons, the condition is most common in women between 14 and 30. The condition sometimes affects several members of the same family,and there is some evidence that the condition can be inherited.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most people with mitral valve prolapse do not have any symptoms, and the condition is discovered only when a doctor hears a certain clicking sound with or without a heart murmur during a routine physical examination. In the past, mitral valve prolapse was blamed for symptoms such as chest pains, palpitations and lightheadedness. Although a person with mitral valve prolapse can also have these types of symptoms, mitral valve prolapse is not the cause.\nPeople who have mitral regurgitation that continues to get worse can have symptoms of congestive heart failure (fatigue, shortness of breath, leg swelling).\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will review your medical history, including any history of heart disease, excessive fatigue, leg swelling or shortness of breath.\nYou and your doctor may not suspect that you have mitral valve prolapse until your doctor hears a sound called a systolic click with the stethoscope during the cardiac portion of a routine physical examination. The systolic click is an abnormal heart sound related to the malfunction of the mitral valve in mitral valve prolapse. Some people also have a heart murmur, an abnormal heart sound caused by turbulent blood flow.\nYour doctor can diagnose mitral valve prolapse if he or she hears the typical click. Your doctor may order an echocardiogram to determine the severity of the prolapse. This is a painless test that uses sound waves to map out your heart structure. However, an echocardiogram is not really needed for diagnosis, which can usually be made with a careful physical examination.\n\nIf you have symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness or palpitations, further tests may be needed to determine the cause.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Mitral valve prolapse is a lifelong condition. However, most people with the condition do not have any symptoms.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent mitral valve prolapse.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have mitral valve prolapse but do not have any symptoms, then you will not need treatment. In the past, your doctor may have recommended antibiotics prior to certain procedures and dental appointments, but recent guidelines from the American Heart Association indicate that antibiotics are no longer recommended for patients with mitral valve prolapse. Some people who have mitral valve prolapse with chest pains or palpitations take a beta-blocker medication, such as propranolol (Inderal), metoprolol (Lopressor) or atenolol (Tenormin), to treat symptoms.\nIf mitral valve prolapse develops into severe mitral regurgitation, the abnormal mitral valve may need to be repaired or replaced surgically.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you have palpitations or an abnormal pulse, especially if these symptoms have also made you feel lightheaded or faint. Also call your doctor immediately if you have chest pain at any age.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people with mitral valve prolapse never have symptoms, and the condition never significantly affects lifestyle or life expectancy. When surgery is done to reconstruct or replace the mitral valve, it is successful in more than 90% of cases.\n",

      "What is it?": "Moles are small, pigmented spots on the skin that usually appear during childhood or adolescence, although they are sometimes present at birth. They are composed of clusters of pigmented cells called melanocytes. People may develop more moles during adolescence and pregnancy, and existing ones may enlarge or darken somewhat during these times. Despite such changes, moles should always remain:\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "Moles can vary in color. They can be flesh-colored, yellow-brown or dark brown. They also can be flat or raised and can be smooth, hairy or warty. Although moles usually are harmless, in some cases they can become cancerous, causing a potentially deadly tumor called malignant melanoma. For this reason, it is important to monitor moles and have them examined by a dermatologist if they:\nMoles called atypical moles, or dysplastic nevi, have somewhat different physical characteristics and sometimes run in families. They are more likely than common moles to turn into cancer. People with multiple dysplastic nevi and melanoma in two or more first-degree relatives have 25 times the risk of developing melanoma. This is called the dysplastic nevus-melanoma syndrome.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor can determine the type of mole you have by looking at it.\nCommon molesusually are no more than 1 to 10 millimeters (less than half an inch) in diameter. They are flesh-colored, yellow-brown, or dark brown and can be located anywhere on the body. They usually appear during childhood or adolescence.\nAtypical moles(dysplastic nevi) are usually larger in diameter (5 millimeters to 12 millimeters). They are tan to dark brown and may have a mixture of colors, including tan, dark brown, and sometimes pink or black. The border is often irregular and indistinct, and often fades into the surrounding skin. Most commonly, atypical moles appear on sun-exposed skin, but they can occur elsewhere, and they continue to develop after age 35.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Most moles never become a problem. However, moles should be inspected regularly for any abnormal changes.\n",
      "Prevention": "When melanocytes become cancerous, they are called melanomas. It is important to examine your moles regularly to look for any suspicious changes. Get someone else to inspect your scalp and other areas that are hard to see. Watch for the early warning signs of melanoma by using theABCDEcriteria:\nPractice safe sunning. Never sunbathe or visit a suntan parlor for the sake of tanning. Use high-SPF sunscreen when outdoors, wear protective hats and clothing, and avoid the outdoors when the sun is most intense, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sweating or swimming can cause sunscreen to wash off, even if it is labeled as \"waterproof.\" Reapply sunscreen often.\n\n",
      "Treatment": "Common moles do not need to be removed. However, some people choose to have them removed for cosmetic reasons; if they are raised and located in areas where clothing irritates them, such as the waistline; or if they are on the scalp and are irritated by hair brushing. Most moles can be cut off in a simple in-office procedure. Moles and dysplastic nevi whose appearance suggests they may be cancerous should be removed and examined under a microscope. If they are found to be cancerous, additional skin in the surrounding area also must be removed.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Do not ignore warning signs. Have suspicious moles checked by a dermatologist. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, but early diagnosis could save your life. If a mole appears abnormal, your doctor will do a biopsy by taking some of the mole tissue so it can be examined in a laboratory. Also, having a doctor check your moles once is not enough. Normal-looking moles can become cancerous later. Moles must be examined from time to time, especially if you notice any changes. If you have dysplastic nevi or if there is a history of melanoma in your family, you should have a physician check all of your moles regularly.

      "What is molluscum contagiosum?": "Molluscum contagiosum is a skin disease caused by a virus that causes clusters of tiny, firm, flesh-colored or pearly bumps. The infection is mainly spread by direct skin-to-skin contact. The bumps or lesions appear at the site of contact anywhere on the body except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\n\n",
      "Symptoms of molluscum contagiosum": "Usually, the only symptom of molluscum contagiosum is the tiny bumps on the skin. These flesh-colored or pearly growths look somewhat like tiny pimples with a central crater. A waxy substance may come out of the bumps when they are squeezed. Itching may also occur.\nIn children, the bumps tend to appear on the face, arms, legs and middle of the body. In adults, molluscum contagiosum tends to appear on the genitals, thighs, and lower abdomen because the infection usually is spread through sexual contact.\nThe bumps usually are grouped in one or two areas, but also can appear in many places on the body. Most people have fewer than 20 bumps. But people with weakened immune systems can develop several hundred bumps.\nThe bumps start out small, but can grow up to 3 to 6 millimeters (about 1/4 inch or less). In rare cases, the bumps can become as large as about an inch. This might happen in a person with a weakened immune system, such as someone with advanced HIV infection.\nMany people itch at the site of the lesions, but for some people the bumps cause no symptoms.\n",
      "Diagnosing molluscum contagiosum": "Your doctor usually can diagnose molluscum contagiosum by looking at the skin bumps. If there is some question about the diagnosis, the doctor may do a biopsy, removing a small piece of a bump for examination under a microscope.\n",
      "Expected duration of molluscum contagiosum": "Individual bumps can last two to four months. But the disease can spread to other areas if the bumps come in contact with an uninfected area of skin, or if you touch a bump then touch an uninfected area. In most people, all lesions go away within six to nine months. However, in some people with weakened immune systems, the disease can last for years.\n",
      "Preventing molluscum contagiosum": "The only way to prevent molluscum contagiosum is to avoid close contact with people who have the disease.\n",
      "Treating molluscum contagiosum": "The infection may heal on its own after several months.\nHowever, you or your child may want treatment to decrease the risk of infecting others and spreading to other parts of the body. Your doctor can remove the bumps in the office. He or she can freeze them with liquid nitrogen or scrape them off the skin.\nIn people with HIV and other conditions that weaken the immune system, it's harder to get rid of the bumps. However, if the immune system is improved by treating the HIV with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), the lesions often go away on their own.\nFor people that continue to have molluscum, other possible treatments include cantharidin applied by a clinician in the office and laser surgery.\n",
      "When o call a professional": "See your doctor if you develop unexplained skin bumps. There are many different causes of skin eruptions, and a health professional can determine if you need treatment.\n",

      "What is Morton's neuroma?": "A Morton's neuroma is a benign (noncancerous) swelling along a nerve in the foot that carries sensations from the toes. The reason the nerve starts to swell is unknown. But once swelling begins, the nearby bones and ligaments put pressure on the nerve, causing more irritation and inflammation. This produces burning pain, numbness, tingling and other abnormal sensations in the toes. A Morton's neuroma also is called an interdigital neuroma, intermetatarsal neuroma or a forefoot neuroma.\n\nA Morton's neuroma usually develops between the third and fourth toes. Less commonly, it develops between the second and third toes. Other locations are rare. It also is rare for a Morton's neuroma to develop in both feet at the same time. The condition is much more common in women than men, probably as a result of wearing high-heeled, narrow-toed shoes. This style of shoe tends to shift the bones of the feet into an abnormal position, which increases the risk that a neuroma will form. Being overweight also increases the risk of a Morton's neuroma.\n",
      "Symptoms of Morton's neuroma": "A Morton's neuroma usually causes burning pain, numbness or tingling at the base of the third, fourth or second toes. Pain also can spread from the ball of the foot out to the tips of the toes. In some cases, there also is the sensation of a lump, a fold of sock or a \"hot pebble\" between the toes.\nTypically, the pain of a Morton's neuroma is relieved temporarily by taking off your shoes, flexing your toes and rubbing your feet. Symptoms may be aggravated by standing for prolonged periods, high impact activities (such as running), or by wearing high heels or shoes with a narrow toe box.\n",
      "Diagnosisng Morton's neuroma": "Your doctor will suspect that you have a Morton's neuroma based on the nature and location of your foot pain. He or she may ask questions about your shoes — what type of shoes you usually wear and whether these shoes have narrow toes or high heels. To rule out other causes of foot pain, your doctor may ask questions about your medical history, especially any history of arthritis, nerve and muscle problems or previous injury to your foot or leg.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will examine your feet. He or she will look for areas of tenderness, swelling, calluses, numbness, muscle weakness and limited motion. To check for a Morton's neuroma, your doctor will squeeze the sides of your foot. Squeezing should compress the neuroma and trigger your typical pain. In some cases, your doctor will find numbness in the webbed area between the affected toes. Pain in two or more locations on one foot, such as between both the second and third toes and the third and fourth toes, more likely indicates that the toe joints are inflamed rather than a Morton's neuroma.\nBased on the physical examination, your doctor usually can diagnose a Morton's neuroma without additional testing. A foot X-ray may be ordered to make sure that there isn't a stress fracture, but it will not show the actual neuroma. If the diagnosis is in doubt, your doctor may recommend an ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the foot.\n",
      "Expected duration of Morton's neuroma": "A Morton's neuroma will not disappear on its own. Usually, the symptoms will come and go, depending on the type of shoes you wear and how much time you spend on your feet. Sometimes, the symptoms will go away completely.\n",
      "Preventing Morton's neuroma": "It is not always possible to prevent a Morton's neuroma. However, you probably can reduce your risk by wearing comfortable shoes that have low heels, plenty of toe space and good arch support.\n",
      "Treating Morton's neuroma": "If your Morton's neuroma is painful, initial treatment is generally conservative (non-surgical), including:\n\nOther conservative treatments, such as topical capsaicin, shockwave therapy, or injections of botulinum toxin (Botox) may be helpful but are not well studied.\nIt can take six months or more for conservative treatment to provide significant benefit. If pain continues, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the neuroma or to widen the space through which the affected nerve travels. These types of surgery are often performed under local anesthesia. If your doctor removes a portion of the affected nerve along with the neuroma, you may develop permanent numbness between the toes.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment to see a health care professional if you have symptoms of a Morton's neuroma that do not improve when you wear comfortable, wide shoes.\n",
      "Prognosis": "More than 80% of people with a Morton's neuroma will respond to conservative treatment. For the minority of people who have persistent, disabling symptoms, surgery may be an option.\n",

      "What is it?": "Many types of bacteria can cause skin infections. Most cases are caused byStaphylococcus aureus(\"staph\") orStreptococcus pyogenes(\"strep\"). Strep infections still respond well to standard antibiotics. However, that is not true for all staph infections.\nOver the last few decades, it has become more common for a certain strain of drug-resistant staph bacteria to cause skin infections. Originally, these resistant staph infections were seen mostly in hospitals. But now they have spread into the general community. This strain of bacteria is named community-acquired methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus, or \"community-acquired MRSA.\"\nSkin infections include cellulitis, abscesses (boils), or a combination of the two.  MRSA bacteria can cause skin infections that don't look any different from those caused by common staph and strep. However, MRSA skin infections are more likely to show blisters or develop abscesses.\nSkin infections occur when strep or staph bacteria break through the skin's protective outer layer, typically at the site of an injury, such as a cut, puncture, sore, burn, or bite. Once beneath the skin surface, the bacteria multiply and make chemicals that cause inflammation in the skin.\nCellulitis most often occurs on the legs and feet. However, it can develop on any part of the body, including the trunk, arms, and face. It often develops where there is edema (swelling), poor blood flow, or a skin rash that creates breaks in the skin, such as a fungal infection between the toes (athlete's foot).\n",
      "Symptoms": "In cellulitis, the affected skin feels warm and is usually red, swollen, and painful. The redness can be slight or can stand out dramatically compared to the surrounding skin. The area of warmth can be felt with the back of the hand, especially when compared to surrounding skin. There may be a spreading network of red streaks in the skin, caused by infection in the vessels that carry lymph (tissue fluid), as well as enlarged lymph nodes (swollen glands) near the area of infection.\n\nIf you have blisters or pus on the surface of your skin rash, the cellulitis is more likely to be caused by MRSA.\nFever and a general feeling of sickness (malaise) often accompany cellulitis. Severe infections can cause abnormally low blood pressure if bacteria get into the bloodstream.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Many people who develop a skin infection have no other medical problems and no obvious injury or skin damage that allowed the infection to occur. This is also true for people with a MRSA skin infection. However, people in certain groups have a much higher risk than others that their skin infection is caused by MRSA:\nYour doctor can usually diagnose whether you have cellulitis, a boil, or a carbuncle based on your recent medical history, your symptoms, and a physical examination. Your doctor may also recommend tests to look for other conditions that could indicate something different or a deeper, more serious infection.\nIn most cases, your doctor will not be able to tell you which specific bacteria type has caused your skin infection. For simple boils, drainage is often sufficient without the need to take an antibiotic. Cellulitis, carbuncles, and large boils usually require treatment with antibiotics.\nMRSA skin infections look like infections caused by other types of bacteria. If your doctor is concerned about MRSA, he or she will choose an antibiotic that is recommended for MRSA skin infections.\nYour doctor may perform a culture of the pus in a boil or carbuncle to determine if it contains MRSA. Studies have shown that culture of the skin in people with cellulitis is not useful. Your treatment can be adjusted if you are not improving.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long a skin infection lasts depends on the extent of the infection, the bacteria that caused the infection, and your general health. Without proper antibiotic treatment, some skin infections can cause serious complications within a few days, even in otherwise healthy people.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent MRSA skin infections:\n",
      "Treatment": "Cellulitis is treated with antibiotics. An abscess usually needs to be treated with incision and drainage (I & D). Your doctor will choose a specific antibiotic depending on the site of your skin infection and how likely it is that MRSA caused it. Most cases of cellulitis improve quickly once you start taking antibiotics. Once an abscess is drained, the person will quickly begin to feel better. Your doctor may prescribe a course of antibiotics after the I & D.\nIf you have mild cellulitis, you can usually treat it at home with antibiotics taken by mouth. The oral antibiotics used most often are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline or clindamycin. However, keep in touch with your doctor to be sure that the infection is improving as expected. It also helps to apply warm compresses, such as a warm, moist washcloth, and elevate the infected area.\nIf you have severe cellulitis, you may need to be treated in the hospital with antibiotics given intravenously (into a vein), usually IV vancomycin.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever a skin injury becomes red, warm, swollen, or tender. Call your doctor promptly if you get a deep puncture wound, especially on a hand or foot, or if you are bitten by an animal or human.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, skin infections begin to improve within 24 to 48 hours after starting appropriate treatment. Very rarely, the infection may involve tissues below the skin. These deeper infections can be extremely serious and require intensive in-hospital treatment.\n",

      "What is it?": "Mumps is an infection with a virus that causes swelling of the parotid glands in front of each ear. The parotid glands make saliva. Mumps is caused by the mumps virus, a type of paramyxovirus that spreads from person to person through coughs, sneezes and saliva, as well as through contact with contaminated items and surfaces (used tissues, shared drinking glasses, dirty hands that touched a runny nose).\nOnce the mumps virus enters the body, it passes into the bloodstream and can spread to many different glands and to the brain:\nRarely, the mumps virus can affect other parts of the body, such as the joints, thyroid gland or lungs.\nWhen a pregnant woman develops mumps, there may be some increased risk of fetal death and miscarriage if the mother is in her first trimester. However, the infection probably does not increase the risk of birth defects.\nPeople with mumps are contagious during a period that begins 48 hours before and ends 6 to 9 days after the beginning of the mumps symptoms. Before an effective vaccine became available in the late 1960s, there were almost 190,000 reported cases of mumps each year in the United States. Now, thanks to the mumps vaccine, the number of annual cases has decreased by more than 99%.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In about 15% to 20% of patients, mumps does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they usually begin 14 to 18 days after exposure to someone with a mumps infection.\nIn about half of patients, symptoms of mumps infection may include fever, headache, sore throat, muscle aches, poor appetite and malaise (a general feeling of sickness). The mumps virus causes pain and swelling in front of the earlobe, called parotitis. Because of the pain of parotitis, chewing and swallowing may be very uncomfortable, and the patient may not feel like eating.\nInfrequently, male teenagers and adults with mumps can develop swelling and pain in one or both testes (orchitis). In women, the ovaries may be involved, which can cause lower abdominal pain.\nIn patients of either sex, but more commonly in adults than in children, there also may be more serious complications including:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your exposure to any person who is known to have mumps or facial swelling. Even if you did not have face-to-face contact with this person, your doctor will want to know if you attended the same school, lived in the same household or dormitory, or worked in the same building.\nYour doctor also will want to know whether you were immunized against mumps, when you were immunized, and the number of doses of mumps vaccine you received. Mumps vaccine often is given as part of the measle/mumps/rubella vaccine, or MMR, shot.\nYour doctor will suspect that you have mumps if you have had tender parotid swelling on both sides for at least two days and if you have a history of being exposed to someone with mumps. In patients without parotid swelling, the diagnosis can be confirmed with blood tests that measure specific antibodies (defensive proteins made by the immune system) against the mumps virus. Also, the mumps virus itself may be detected in samples of urine, saliva or cerebrospinal fluid (fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord), which is obtained with a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Symptoms of mumps generally last about 10 days. Once you recover, you usually are immune from getting the mumps virus for the rest of your life.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can almost always prevent mumps with the mumps vaccine, which is usually given as part of the MMR combination. This live-virus vaccine generally is not recommended for pregnant women or for patients who are taking certain medications or have medical problems that suppress the immune system.\nBecause patients with mumps are contagious for about 48 hours before they develop symptoms, it usually is not necessary to isolate them from other members of the household once symptoms begin. This is because family members probably were exposed to the virus during that 48-hour period before symptoms began.\nChildren with mumps usually are excluded from school or child care for five days after parotid gland swelling begins. Local public health officials usually are involved to help control outbreaks.\n",
      "Treatment": "In patients who are generally healthy, the symptoms of mumps are treated with:\nAspirin should not be used in children with mumps because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious brain problem that develops in children who have certain viral illnesses and have been treated with aspirin.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you or someone in your family develops symptoms of mumps, even if they have been vaccinated against mumps. Also, if a mumps outbreak occurs in your school or workplace, call your doctor to determine if you are immune to mumps. If you are a woman who is considering becoming pregnant, be certain that your immunizations are up to date.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People recover completely from mumps. In males, there is a small risk of sterility if the infection affects both testicles (bilateral orchitis), but this is unusual.\n",

      "What is it?": "A muscle strain is the stretching or tearing of muscle fibers. Most muscle strains happen for one of two reasons: either the muscle has been stretched beyond its limits or it has been forced to contract too strongly. In mild cases, only a few muscle fibers are stretched or torn, and the muscle remains intact and strong. In severe cases, however, the strained muscle may be torn and unable to function properly. To help simplify diagnosis and treatment, doctors often classify muscle strains into three grades, depending on the severity of muscle fiber damage:\nAlthough the risk of muscle strain is especially high during sports activities, you also can strain a muscle by lifting a heavy carton or by simply stepping off a curb.\nAlmost all types of athletic activity carry some risk of muscle strains, but these injuries tend to happen most often in contact sports, such as football, and in sports that require quick starts, such as basketball and tennis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of muscle strain include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will want to know what type of activity triggered your muscle pain and whether there was a pop in the muscle at the time of injury. The doctor will ask about your symptoms, especially any decrease in muscle strength or any difficulty moving.\nYour doctor will want to know whether you've had recent fever, weight loss, leg numbness, urinary or bladder problems, or other symptoms that may point to a more severe medical problem.\nAfter noting your symptoms and past medical history, your doctor will examine you, checking for muscle tenderness, spasm, weakness and decreased muscle movement. If this exam points to a mild or moderate muscle strain, you may not need any additional testing. However, if the diagnosis is in doubt, X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be helpful.\nIf you have back pain, your doctor may order additional tests to check for other causes of symptoms, such as a urinary tract infection or a problem involving the vertebrae (backbones), vertebral disks, spinal canal, or spinal cord.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long a sprain lasts depends on the location and severity of the injury. Symptoms of a mild back strain usually improve within one to two weeks and are gone within four to six weeks. In the legs, mild or moderate strains may take up to 8 to 10 weeks or more to heal. Symptoms of a severe (Grade III) strain may persist until the torn muscle heals or is repaired surgically.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent muscle strains:\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have a Grade I or Grade II strain, your doctor will ask you to follow the RICE rule:\nTo help relieve muscle pain and swelling, your doctor may suggest that you take acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others). For someone with a painful back strain that does not improve with NSAIDs or acetaminophen (Tylenol), prescription pain medications or muscle relaxants may be appropriate.\nIf you have a severe Grade II or Grade III strain, your doctor may refer you to an orthopedic specialist. Depending on the severity and location of your muscle strain, the orthopedist may immobilize the injured muscle in a cast for several weeks or repair it surgically.\nMild strains may heal quickly on their own, but more severe strains may require a rehabilitation program.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly if:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Recovery depends on the location and severity of your muscle strain. In general, almost all Grade I strains heal within a few weeks, whereas Grade II strains may take two to three months or longer.\nAfter surgery to repair a Grade III strain, most people regain normal muscle function after several months of rehabilitation.\n",

      "What is myasthenia gravis?": "Myasthenia gravis is a chronic (long-lasting) and rare disease that affects the way muscles respond to signals from nerves, leading to muscle weakness. The disease can occur at any age, but it mainly affects women between ages 20 and 40. After age 50, men are more likely to get the disease.\nNormal muscle movement relies on chemical signals from the nerves. Nerve signals cause the nerve endings to release a chemical called acetylcholine into the small space between the nerve and the muscle. This chemical binds to special acetylcholine receptors on the muscle cells and causes the muscle to contract.\nMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's defense mechanism, the immune system, begins to attack the body's own tissues instead of foreign invaders, such as viruses. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system attacks the acetylcholine receptors with specific antibodies. Some of the receptors are destroyed or blocked, which means that the chemical message cannot be received. Therefore, muscles do not contract properly and become weak. It has been estimated that up to 80% of a person's acetylcholine receptors can be damaged due to this disease.\nNormally, the amount of acetylcholine available to be released to muscle cells diminishes with repeated, prolonged or strenuous activity. In a person with myasthenia gravis, that normal decrease combined with fewer working receptors causes increasing weakness, or myasthenic fatigue. Muscles that may seem normal at first become weak with continued use. This is why a person with myasthenia gravis will feel strongest immediately after waking up or resting and weakest at the end of the day when muscles have been in continual use.\nMyasthenia gravis typically strikes muscles in the face first. Muscles that control the eyelids and eye movements usually are affected early in the disease. Later, facial weakness can make smiling, chewing, swallowing and talking difficult.\nIn most people, the disease eventually spreads to other areas and can affect the muscles of the arms and legs. Sometimes, the disease affects the muscles that control breathing. In some situations, such as during a respiratory infection, this weakness becomes severe. The person may need a breathing tube and a ventilator. It's known as a myasthenic crisis.\nNo one knows what causes the body to attack its own cells. The thymus, a gland located in the chest just above the heart, is involved in immunity early in life. The thymus gland is thought to be the site of abnormal antibody production in myasthenia gravis, although its precise role is not yet understood. The thymus is abnormal in about 80% of people with myasthenia gravis; enlargement is the most common abnormality but about 10% to 15% of people with the disease have a benign (noncancerous) tumor of the thymus.\nAlthough myasthenia gravis is not believed to be inherited or contagious, babies born to mothers who have myasthenia gravis have an increased risk of having the disease at birth. This probably is because the baby acquires the antibodies that attack the body's cells from the mother during gestation. Usually, the baby's symptoms go away within a few weeks after birth.\n",
      "Symptoms of myasthenia gravis": "The primary symptoms of myasthenia gravis are that muscles are weak and tire quickly. These symptoms can take many forms, and the symptoms may be more or less severe for different people. Symptoms may include some or all of the following:\nSudden, severe weakness (myasthenic crisis) may develop without warning, sometimes triggered by an infection or other stress, causing breathing and swallowing problems. Ocular myasthenia gravis is limited to the eye while generalized myasthenia gravis may affect muscles throughout the body.\n",
      "Diagnosing myasthenia gravis": "Your doctor will ask detailed questions about your symptoms and will examine you. He or she will test your muscle strength and reflexes, eyelid strength and eye movements.  If you are experiencing drooping eyelids as part of your weakness, your doctor may apply a bag of ice to your eyelids to see if the drooping improves (because weakness tends to improve with direct cooling of the weak muscles).  If the results suggest myasthenia gravis, some specific tests may be done to confirm the diagnosis. These include:\nIn addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or computed tomography (CT) scans may be done to look for abnormalities of the thymus. Pulmonary function tests, which measure breathing strength, also may be recommended, because they can alert doctors to any potential breathing problems. Additional testing, including blood tests or other imaging tests, often is suggested to exclude other possible explanations for a person's symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration of myasthenia gravis": "Myasthenia gravis is a chronic (long-lasting) disease that usually worsens slowly over time. Although symptoms may fluctuate in severity over the years, the disease rarely goes away on its own. It is likely to return even after periods when the disease has not been active.\n",
      "Preventing myasthenia gravis": "Because the cause of myasthenia gravis is unknown, there is no way to prevent it. However, once the disease has developed, there may be ways to prevent episodes of worsening symptoms or flare-ups:\n",
      "Treating myasthenia gravis": "There are many possible treatments for myasthenia gravis. You and your doctor should work together to determine the best treatment for you.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you experience any unexplained muscle weakness or fatigue.\nIf you have been diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, it is critically important to be prepared to seek help in case of a myasthenic crisis. If the muscles that control your breathing are affected, call your doctor if you develop a respiratory infection or even a small breathing difficulty. Seek immediate help if you have significant difficulty with breathing or swallowing.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Myasthenia gravis is a chronic disease, although there may be periods of remission, when symptoms disappear. Current treatments, however, can allow most people with myasthenia gravis to live normal or near-normal lives. People with ocular myasthenia gravis (without progression over several years) have a better prognosis than those with generalized disease.\nOther autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) or rheumatoid arthritis, may be associated with myasthenia gravis and may develop either before or after the weakness is noticed.\n",

      "What is myocarditis?": "Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle that may decrease the ability of the heart to pump blood normally. It can be caused by:\n",
      "Symptoms of myocarditis": "The symptoms of myocarditis depend on the cause and severity. For example, many people with uncomplicated myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus don't have any symptoms. Other people have fever, chest pain, cardiac arrhythmias (abnormally fast, slow, or irregular heartbeats), sudden loss of consciousness (syncope), or symptoms related to heart failure (shortness of breath, leg swelling).\n",
      "Diagnosing myocarditis": "Your doctor may suspect myocarditis based on your medical history and symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will examine you, paying special attention to your heart. This will be followed by an EKG (a test that measures the heart's electrical activity), a chest x-ray, an echocardiogram (a test using sound waves to assess heart function), and blood tests.\nIn some patients, your doctor may order tests to determine if a virus or other infectious agent is the cause. These tests may include blood tests or attempts to detect certain types of viruses from stool, throat washings, or other body fluids.\n",
      "Expected duration of myocarditis": "How long myocarditis lasts depends on the cause and the person's general health before the heart problems began. For example, in many healthy adults with uncomplicated coxsackievirus myocarditis, symptoms can start to improve over a couple of weeks; in other cases, the heart takes a few months to recover. Sometimes, the damage to the heart muscle is permanent, and heart failure persists even after the inflammation has resolved.\n",
      "Preventing myocarditis": "Myocarditis caused by certain infections can often be avoided by vaccination and by practicing good hygiene, especially washing your hands often. HIV can be prevented by following safe sex practices and avoiding intravenous drug use. Myocarditis caused by insect-borne Chagas' disease can be prevented by using effective insecticides in Latin American countries where the illness is common.\n",
      "Treating myocarditis": "Treatment of myocarditis depends on the cause and severity. For example, people with only mild viral myocarditis may recover completely with only a period of rest. They will be advised not to smoke or to drink alcohol, and to limit strenuous activities.\nPeople with myocarditis that causes heart failure symptoms or irregular heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmias) will be treated in a hospital. There they may receive one or more of the following:\n",
      "When to all a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you have chest pain, even if you think that you are too young to have heart problems (as people of any age can get myocarditis).\n",
      "Prognosis": "In many people with uncomplicated viral myocarditis, the heart muscle improves without specific therapy, and myocarditis-related EKG and echocardiogram abnormalities eventually disappear. However, more severe forms of myocarditis may cause permanent damage to the heart muscle, leading to long-term heart failure and significant abnormalities of heart rhythm.\n",

In other cases, it is part of a chronic (long-term) condition. Chronic forms of myositis can lead to muscle atrophy (wasting and shrinking) and severe disability.\nThere are many different types of myositis, including:\n",

      "Diagnosing myositis": "Your doctor will ask you to describe your symptoms. It is especially important to describe the exact location of any weakness or muscle pain, and how long you have had it. The doctor also will review your medical history and current medications.\nNext, your doctor will examine you, paying special attention to your muscles and nerves. Depending on what your doctor finds, he or she may order diagnostic tests. Common tests used to diagnose muscle problems include:\n",

      "What are nabothian cysts?": "Nabothian cysts are cysts filled with mucus that look like tiny bumps on the surface of the cervix. They are usually 2 millimeters to 10 millimeters in diameter, and they contain mucus that ranges in color from pale yellow to amber.\nIn most cases, nabothian cysts occur when new tissue regrows on the cervix after childbirth. This new tissue blocks the openings of the cervix's nabothian glands, trapping their mucous secretion in tiny pockets under the skin. Nabothian cysts are a normal finding on the cervix of women who have had children. They also are seen in menopausal women whose cervical skin has thinned with age. Less often, nabothian cysts are related to chronic cervicitis, a long-term infection of the cervix.\nNabothian cysts also are called nabothian follicles, epithelial inclusion cysts, and mucinous retention cysts.\n",
      "Symptoms of nabothian cysts": "Nabothian cysts do not cause any symptoms unless they become very large.\n",
      "Diagnosing nabothian cysts": "In most cases, your doctor discovers that you have nabothian cysts during a routine gynecological exam. They almost always are considered to be normal.\nRarely, when there is something unusual about the cyst's size or appearance, your doctor may do a procedure called a colposcopy, which uses a magnifying instrument to examine the surface of the cervix closely. If the cyst looks abnormal during this exam, your doctor may do a biopsy to check for rare forms of mucus-producing cancer. In a biopsy, a small piece of tissue from the cervix is removed and examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration of nabothian cysts": "Nabothian cysts are usually a long-term condition. Over time, some cysts may get bigger.\n",
      "Preventing nabothian cysts": "Because nabothian cysts are considered to be normal, it is not necessary to prevent them.\n",
      "Treating nabothian cysts": "Usually, no treatment is needed. However, in some cases, your gynecologist may choose to remove the cyst. This can be done one of two ways:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Because nabothian cysts are normal and do not cause any symptoms, you probably will not know they are there. However, if you are an adult woman who is sexually active, it is important to visit your gynecologist at least once a year for a routine checkup.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis is excellent.\n",

      "What is nail trauma?": "A fingernail or toenail can be injured by a blow to the nail or by closing the finger or toe in a door or drawer. This kind of trauma commonly results in blood under the nail, a condition called subungual hematoma. Nails also can be accidentally torn or split, or a splinter can get under the nail.\nRepeated trauma to toenails, caused by ill-fitting shoes, can lead to deformities in the nails. The deformities may resemble a fungal infection; nails can be thickened or discolored and can lift away from the nail bed, which causes cosmetic concerns.\nHabits such as nail biting and cuticle biting also can cause trauma to the nails. Nail biting is a main cause of acute paronychia, a type of infection in which bacteria get underneath the tissue at the side of the nail and cause swelling and irritation. Repetitive picking at your thumb's nail and cuticle with your index finger can produce a line of horizontal hatch marks in the middle of the nail. In extreme cases, the nail can split.\n",
      "Symptoms of nail trauma": "A subungual hematoma appears dark red under the nail. The finger or toe is painful and may throb.\n\nOther nail trauma also may be painful, and the nail can split, crack, or lift away from the nail bed.\n",
      "Diagnosing nail trauma": "Your doctor can examine any nail trauma to decide what course of action is best. Depending on the trauma, your doctor may want to have X-rays taken.\n",
      "Expected duration of nail trauma": "Nail injuries can be noticeable until the damaged nail grows out. Fingernails usually regrow completely in about two months. Toenails take about four months. If injury includes the base of the nail, some cosmetic changes may be permanent.\n",
      "Preventing nail trauma": "To help prevent nail trauma:\n",
      "Treating nail trauma": "Treatment for a subungual hematoma is aimed at relieving pressure by draining the blood trapped under the nail. For a small hematoma, you can heat a needle or the end of a paper clip until it is red-hot. Using gentle pressure, the hot tip can penetrate the nail, creating a small hole through which blood can drain. The nail may remain discolored after the procedure.\nSome people do not feel comfortable doing this at home. Your physician can provide the same treatment in his or her office using a sterile blade or needle. If blood takes up more than half of the area under your nail, a physician should evaluate the nail. Occasionally, the nail may need to be removed so a deep tear can be repaired with stitches.\nIf the nail is torn or jagged, you should trim it to avoid snagging it on things and further injuring it.\nIf your nail lifts completely off the nail bed, it may be most comfortable initially to replace the nail and hold it in place with a bandage. Nails will not reattach themselves to the nail bed after they have separated from it, but in most cases new nail will slowly regrow.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If blood under the nail occupies more than half of the nail area, a physician should evaluate the finger because it could signify an underlying bone fracture or tissue tear. Your doctor also should evaluate bleeding under the nail that is not caused by trauma.\nIf you experience a nail injury, make sure that your tetanus vaccination is up to date.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is excellent. If the trauma to the nail injures the nail matrix (the tissue inside the cuticle at the base of the nail where new nail is formed), a ridge or split can develop. If the matrix heals normally, this deformity eventually will disappear as the nail regrows.\n",

      "What is narcolepsy?": "Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep. These episodes can occur often and at inappropriate times, for example while a person is talking, eating, or driving. Although sleep episodes can happen at any time, they may be more frequent during periods of inactivity or monotonous, repetitive activity.\nNarcolepsy usually appears between ages 15 and 30, but the condition can appear earlier or later. Once it appears, narcolepsy is present for life. Men and women are affected equally.\nAbout 50% of people with diagnosed narcolepsy have the combination of marked daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of muscle weakness (called cataplexy). The muscle weakness can be so severe that a person with narcolepsy will collapse to the floor, but not become unconscious. This type of narcolepsy is associated with a shortage of a brain-stimulating protein called orexin (also known as hypocretin).\nThe cause of other types of narcolepsy is unknown. A genetic (inherited) predisposition appears to play a role.\nPeople with narcolepsy don't require extra hours of sleep, but they do need daytime naps because they have difficulty staying awake for long periods. During the night, healthy people normally progress through several stages of sleep before entering or leaving the state of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM). During REM sleep, your brain waves resemble those of an awake person, visual dreams occur, and muscle tone is slack. In narcolepsy, the brain-wave pattern can skip some or all of the other sleep stages, causing the person to move from the awake state immediately to REM sleep, or to awaken directly from the REM sleep stage.\n",
      "Symptoms of narcolepsy": "The earliest symptom of narcolepsy is usually daytime sleepiness, which may be extreme. However, it may take years to recognize the disorder because other, more common causes of daytime sleepiness often are blamed for the symptoms.\nNarcolepsy has four main symptoms. It is common for people with narcolepsy to have more than one symptom, but it is rare for a person with the disease to experience all four:\nSymptoms usually begin during adolescence or young adulthood. People with narcolepsy complain of fatigue, experience impaired performance at work and school, and may have difficulty in social relationships. Excessive daytime sleepiness can be disabling and may greatly diminish a person's quality of life. Memory lapses and visual disturbances may be particularly upsetting.\nMore than 50% of people with narcolepsy experience periods of memory lapse or blackouts caused by very short periods of sleep called microsleeps. Microsleeps are not unique to people with narcolepsy, and they can be experienced by anyone who is severely sleep deprived. They are periods of sleep that last only a few seconds, and usually are not noticed. During such episodes, a person may get lost while walking or driving, write or speak nonsense, misplace objects, or bump into things. Later in the course of narcolepsy, a person also can develop insomnia (difficulty sleeping) during normal sleeping hours.\n",
      "Diagnosing narcolepsy": "To diagnose narcolepsy, your doctor will ask you about your history of typical episodes and will have you undergo an overnight sleep study. The sleep study checks for other explanations that could account for daytime sleepiness, such as sleep apnea or other causes of sleep interruptions. The sleep test measures brain waves, eye movements, muscle activity, heartbeat, blood oxygen levels, and breathing.\nA specific study called a multiple sleep latency test is a necessary part of the evaluation for narcolepsy. This test must be done after the person has had an adequate night's sleep. A multiple sleep latency test consists of four 20-minute opportunities to nap, which are offered every two hours throughout the day. Patients with narcolepsy fall asleep in approximately five minutes or less, and move into REM sleep during at least two of the four naps. Normal, well-rested sleepers take about 12 to 14 minutes to fall asleep for a daytime nap, and don't fall directly into REM sleep.\n",
      "Expected duration of narcolepsy": "Narcolepsy cannot be cured and does not go away. In most cases, symptoms can be diminished with medications, regularly scheduled naps, and good sleep habits.\n",
      "Preventing narcolepsy": "There is no way to prevent narcolepsy. For people who have the condition, avoiding conditions that bring on narcolepsy episodes may help to reduce their frequency. If you have narcolepsy and your symptoms are not controlled with medicines, you should never smoke because you could fall asleep with a lit cigarette, and you should never drive.\n",
      "Treating narcolepsy": "The main symptom of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, can be partially relieved with medications that stimulate the central nervous system. Doctors often prescribe a trial of modafinil (Provigil) first. Other potential choices include armodafinil (Nuvigil), pitolisant (Wakix), or solriamfetol (Sunosi).\nregularly scheduled time for exercise and short naps during the day also helps reduce daytime sleepiness.\nCataplexy and sleep paralysis can be treated with a variety of medicines that can make you more resistant to entering REM sleep. Most of these medicines were developed for use as antidepressants. Examples of potentially effective medications include venlafaxine (Effexor), fluoxetine (Prozac), and protriptyline (Vivactil).\nCataplexy also can be treated with sodium oxybate (also called gamma hydroxybutyrate or Xyrem), although the use of this drug is tightly controlled because it has been abused recreationally. For reasons that are not well understood, a low dose of this medicine reduces cataplexy attacks and improves daytime sleepiness in people who have narcolepsy with cataplexy, even though the drug causes sedation in most people without narcolepsy.\nPsychological counseling may be important for difficulties associated with self-esteem and for emotional support, especially since people with narcolepsy have difficulty doing tasks that require concentration, and may be regarded as unmotivated by family and peers.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call a doctor if you are excessively sleepy during the day. You should be evaluated as quickly as possible if episodes occur while you are driving a car or operating machinery.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People with narcolepsy have a significantly higher risk of death or serious injury resulting from motor vehicle or job-related accidents, and they must take care to avoid situations where such accidents might occur.\n",

      "What is it?": "A nasal polyp is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that grows from the lining of the nose or sinuses. These polyps usually occur in both the right and left nasal passages and obstruct the flow of air. They can make your nose feel stuffy, and can decrease your sense of smell. Not all growths in the nose are polyps.\nNasal polyps may result from chronic (long-lasting) inflammation of the lining of the nose, although they often occur for no apparent reason. People with chronic hay fever (allergic rhinitis) are more likely than others to develop nasal polyps. In addition, nasal polyps commonly develop in children with cystic fibrosis.\nPeople with nasal polyps and asthma often are allergic to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen. They may experience a sudden, severe shortness of breath if they take one of these drugs.\nIf you have nasal polyps and asthma, avoid medications containing aspirin or other NSAID. Remember that aspirin and other NSAIDs are present in many over-the-counter pain pills and cold and flu remedies. They also are present in some skin creams.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The key symptoms of nasal polyps are:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history. He or she probably will ask if you have a history of hay fever, allergic rhinitis, asthma or an allergy to aspirin.\nThe doctor, most commonly an otolaryngologist (ear nose and throat specialist) will examine your nose and look for translucent grapelike masses colored yellow to gray. He or she usually can detect polyps by examining your nasal passages with a special instrument called a nasal endoscope, a small, flexible tube connected to a camera. Sometimes, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be used to determine the location and size of the polyps. CT scanning also will tell if the polyps are coming from the nose or from the sinuses.\nNasal polyps almost always occur on both sides. If a polyp is seen only on one side, a CT scan should be done to make sure that the growth is not something more serious. The scan also can accurately show the size of the growth.\nIn addition to examining your nasal passages, your doctor will ask about your medical history. He or she probably will ask if you have a history of hay fever or allergic rhinitis, asthma or an allergy to aspirin.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Unless treatment is started, polyps will persist as long as the cause is present. Treatment (see below) will shrink or eliminate the polyps. Prolonged treatment is usually necessary to prevent recurrence.\n",
      "Prevention": "Prevention can come in a number of ways. One can eliminate the cause for polyps such as eliminating allergens through environmental controls. One can block the stimulating cause through desensitization treatments. Or one can use maintenance therapy with anti-inflammatory medications such as steroid nasal sprays or leukotriene inhibitors. Many times a combination is necessary for optimal prevention.\n",
      "Treatment": "If the nasal polyps are small, your doctor may prescribe a nasal spray containing corticosteroids, perhaps along with a course of corticosteroid pills, such as prednisone. People with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps not responding to other therapies may be candidates for treatment with one of the FDA approved monoclonal antibodies.\nLarge polyps that do not respond to medical therapy usually require surgery. In most cases the surgery is an outpatient procedure. The surgeon may use a small tube called an endoscope to do the surgery. This avoids the need to make an external incision on the face. The surgeon will send some of the polyp tissue to a lab for closer examination. In rare cases, what appeared to be a polyp may turn out to be something else.\nFor unilateral polyps, a biopsy usually should be done or they should be removed to make sure they are benign.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you experience:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many people with nasal polyps can have their symptoms controlled with medication and allergy treatments. When this fails, surgery can remove the polyps and improve the breathing. Continued medical therapy is usually still necessary after surgery to prevent a recurrence.\n",

      "What is it?": "Nausea is a general term describing a queasy stomach, with or without the feeling that you are about to vomit. Almost everyone experiences nausea at some time, making it one of the most common problems in medicine. Nausea is not a disease, but a symptom of many different disorders. It is caused by problems in any one of three parts of the body, including:\nNausea also is a common side effect of some body chemical changes:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Nausea is difficult for many people to describe. It is a very uncomfortable, but not painful, feeling that is felt in the back of the throat, the chest, or the upper abdomen. The feeling is associated with distaste for food or an urge to vomit. When the body prepares to vomit, the following sequence may occur:\nWhen a person vomits, the stomach contents are expelled through the esophagus and mouth.\nAs a result of these body actions, when you have nausea you experience retching. Retching is repeated rhythmic contractions of respiratory and abdominal muscles that occur without your control. You may or may not vomit. Profuse sweating sometimes accompanies nausea.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Because nausea occurs for such a wide variety of reasons, your doctor will seek clues to the cause of nausea in your medical history, including your medication use. It is especially helpful for you to report other symptoms that you might be having, or activities (such as eating) that trigger your nausea. If you are a sexually active woman of childbearing age, tell your doctor whether there is a possibility that you could be pregnant, the date of your last menstrual period, and any type of birth control you use.\nYour doctor will examine you. The exam may include blood pressure testing, an abdominal examination, neurological examination, or other tests, depending on your recent symptoms and other medical history. Blood tests may be done. For any woman who could be pregnant, a pregnancy test should be done. If you have had a recent head injury, you may require a brain imaging test, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan.\n",
      "Expected duration": "The cause of nausea will determine how long it lasts or how often it occurs. When the cause can be traced to spoiled food, motion sickness, or a viral illness, nausea is usually short-lived and should not be a cause for concern. In most cases, the queasy feeling lasts no more than minutes to a few hours and usually goes away on its own within 24 hours.\n",
      "Prevention": "Some causes of nausea are not easily prevented. While the cause of your nausea is being determined, you can minimize episodes of nausea by following some basic guidelines:\n",
      "Treatment": "Nausea does not always require treatment, but sometimes treatment is helpful. There are several things you can do on your own to help, including:\nSome over-the-counter medications can help to relieve nausea, including:\nIf you continue to feel nauseated, several prescription medications are available to help relieve nausea. Most anti-nausea medicines have drowsiness as a side effect. Women who are pregnant, or who think they might be pregnant, should be evaluated by a physician before taking any drug, including over-the-counter medicines.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should call your doctor if nausea lasts for more than three days. You should contact your doctor sooner if your nausea is associated with\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the cause of the nausea. Most people recover completely within a few hours or a day.\n",

      "What is it?": "A nephrectomy is the surgical removal of a kidney, the organ that filters waste from the blood and produces urine. There are two kidneys, right and left. Each is about four to five inches long. They are located at the back of the abdomen, just below the diaphragm, behind the liver on the right and the spleen on the left. A portion of each kidney is protected by the lowest one or two ribs and by the muscles that cover the back and side of the body.\nDepending on the reason for a nephrectomy, all or part of one kidney or both kidneys will be removed:\nA nephrectomy can be done by conventional open surgery. For a simple nephrectomy, laparoscopic surgery is also available at a growing number of medical centers.\nIn aconventional open nephrectomy,the surgeon removes the kidney through a standard incision (surgical cut) between eight and 12 inches long. When possible, this incision is made in the side of the body to allow the surgeon access to the kidney while only minimally disturbing the abdominal organs. However, depending on the reason for the nephrectomy and the health of the patient, an incision may be made in the front of the abdomen or in the back.\nIn thelaparoscopic procedure,four small incisions are made in the wall of the abdomen. The doctor uses a laparoscope (a rod-shaped instrument with a camera for viewing inside the body) to guide the surgical instruments and to free the kidney. If the kidney is being removed for donation, one incision must be enlarged to between 6 and 9 centimeters so that the kidney can be removed in one piece. Usually, this larger incision is next to the navel or, in women, along the bikini line in the lower abdomen.\nBoth conventional open nephrectomy and laparoscopic nephrectomy are done with the patient under general anesthesia, so that the patient is not awake during the procedure. Laparoscopic nephrectomy usually causes less pain during recovery than a conventional nephrectomy, and allows a quicker recovery and less obvious scarring. However, laparoscopic nephrectomy takes a longer time under anesthesia than an open nephrectomy, and requires a surgeon who is skilled in laparoscopy. A laparoscopic nephrectomy is not practical for people with significant scarring around the kidney or people who need a radical nephrectomy.\n",
      "What it's used for": "A nephrectomy may be used to remove a kidney for the following reasons:\n",
      "Preparation": "About one week before surgery, you will need to stop taking aspirin and other blood-thinning medications. Beginning at midnight on the night before surgery, you must not eat or drink anything. This reduces the risk of vomiting during surgery. As part of the general preparations for surgery, your doctor will review your allergies and medical and surgical histories. If you are a woman, and there is any chance that you might be pregnant, you must tell your doctor before surgery.\n",
      "How it's done": "The medical team inserts an intravenous (IV) line into one of your veins to deliver fluids and medications. You will receive general anesthesia.\n",
      "Follow-up": "About one week after you return home from the hospital, you will visit your doctor for follow-up. At this visit, your doctor will check the healing of your incision and will tell you when you can resume your normal activities. For most people who have had conventional open surgery, full recovery takes about six weeks. When a surgeon does a laparoscopic nephrectomy, a person typically can return to work after about four weeks.\nIn most healthy people who have only one kidney removed, the remaining kidney can function well enough to handle the needs of the body. Life expectancy is normal. People who have both kidneys removed will need a kidney transplant or dialysis, a mechanical procedure that does the filtering work of the missing kidneys.\n",
      "Risks": "The risks of the procedures depend on the type of nephrectomy (simple, radical, bilateral, laparoscopic) and on the surgical approach (location of the incision). Some risks include:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Once you return home from the hospital, call your doctor immediately if:\n",

      "What is it?": "The inside of the nose is covered with moist, delicate tissue (mucosa) that has a rich supply of blood vessels near the surface. When this tissue is injured, even from a minor nick or scratch, these blood vessels tend to bleed, sometimes heavily. Nosebleeds near the front of the nose, called anterior nosebleeds, are very common since this is the most accessible area to injury. The most frequent location is the nasal septum, the wall between the two sides of the nose. In most cases, this type of nosebleed is not serious. It usually can be stopped with some local pressure and a little patience.\nOnly rarely is a nosebleed life threatening or fatal. In these cases, the hemorrhage (severe bleeding) is usually from an artery in a posterior location, higher and deeper in the nose. Posterior bleeds usually drain down the back of the throat, but can also bleed out of both nostrils. Also, in most cases of severe nosebleeds, the person has another health problem, such as high blood pressure or a bleeding disorder, or the person takes a blood-thinning medication that slows down the blood-clotting process.\n\nCertain people are more likely to get nosebleeds because of their environment, work history, health problems or use of medications that increase the tendency to bleed. Common risk factors for nosebleeds include:\nNosebleeds also commonly are caused by trauma, such as nose picking, forceful blowing of the nose or severe facial trauma from an automobile accident or contact sports.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Nosebleeds usually involve one nostril, but occasionally both nostrils are involved. If one nostril becomes partially blocked with a blood clot, the blood might flow out the other nostril or down the back of the throat. In a posterior nosebleed (higher up in the nose), large amounts of blood typically flow down the back of the throat. The amount of bleeding from a nosebleed can vary with posterior bleeds usually bleeding significantly more.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "In otherwise healthy people, most mild anterior nosebleeds can be self-diagnosed and treated at home. If your nosebleed is severe and does not respond to first-aid measures, you will need to see a doctor immediately.\nThe doctor will review your health history and current medications. He or she also will ask you to estimate the amount of blood you've lost, which usually is based on how long you've been bleeding and the number of soaked towels or tissues you've used. Next, the doctor will examine your nose to determine where the bleeding is located. If necessary, he or she may insert a lighted, tube-like instrument called an endoscope into your nose to see the site of bleeding. Blood tests may be done to check for any bleeding abnormalities.\n",
      "Expected duration": "When done correctly, simple first-aid measures usually will stop an uncomplicated anterior nosebleed within minutes.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent nosebleeds by:\n",
      "Treatment": "If you are bleeding from the front of your nose, begin by trying the following first-aid measures:\nAt the same time, use your other hand to apply an ice pack or a plastic bag of crushed ice to the bridge of your nose to slow blood flow.\n\nWhen simple first aid does not stop a nosebleed, your doctor may treat the problem by:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you cannot stop a nosebleed by using the first-aid measures, call your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room.\nAlso, contact your doctor if blood continues to ooze from your nose, especially if you also have persistent nasal stuffiness or a foul-smelling nasal discharge. In older people, especially smokers, these can be symptoms of a tumor inside the nose or sinuses. In a young child, these may be signs that a foreign object is lodged in a nostril.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With a little patience and pressure, almost all uncomplicated nosebleeds respond to simple first-aid measures. Even the nosebleed that requires a doctor's care usually can be treated successfully with cauterization, packing or other options.\nSome people who have excessive bleeding, multiple medical problems or who are taking anticoagulant medications may need to be hospitalized for treatment of a nosebleed.\n",

      "What is it?": "Obesity is an excess of body fat.\nIt is difficult to directly measure body fat. Body mass index (BMI) is a popular method of defining a healthy weight. BMI should be used as a guide, along with waist size, to help estimate the amount of body fat.\nBMI estimates a healthy weight based on your height. Because it considers height as well as weight, it is a somewhat better guide than body weight alone.\nTo calculate your BMI:\nThen use the chart below to see what category your BMI falls into.\nBMI\nCategory\nBelow 18.5\nUnderweight\n18.5 – 24.9\nHealthy\n25.0 – 29.9\nOverweight\n30.0 – 39.9\nObese\nOver 40\nMorbidly obese\nObesity can shorten your life. It can also put you at risk of developing a number of conditions. These include:\nMany other health risks are higher for people who are obese. These risks may increase as the degree of obesity increases.\nWhere you carry the extra weight is also important. People who carry extra weight around their waist may be more likely to experience health problems caused by obesity than those who carry it in their legs and thighs.\nPeople become obese for a number of reasons. Often, several of these factors are involved.\nSome of the most common reasons for obesity are:\n",
      "Symptoms": "The primary warning sign of obesity is an above-average body weight. If you are obese, you may also experience:\nObesity increases your risk for:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Obesity is diagnosed by calculating your BMI. BMI is based on your height and weight. A BMI of 30 or more defines obesity. In general, this means your body weight is 35% to 40% more than your ideal body weight.\nYour body fat also can be calculated by using skin calipers. Calipers are an instrument that measures the thickness of your skin.\nBody shape is also important. People who carry most of their weight around the waist (apple shaped) have a greater risk of heart disease and diabetes than do people with big hips and thighs (pear shaped).\n\nWaist circumference is a good measure of abdominal obesity. Ideally your waist size should be no more than one-half of your height. Women with a waist more than 35 inches or men with a waist more than 40 inches are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, fatty liver and type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Obesity is often a lifelong problem. Once excess weight is gained, it is not easy to lose. Once lost, you will have to work at maintaining your healthier weight.\nThe length of time it takes to reach your weight goal depends on:\nDiseases and conditions caused by obesity often improve as you lose weight.\n",
      "Prevention": "To prevent obesity and maintain a healthy body weight, eat a well-balanced diet and exercise regularly.\nPreventing obesity is important. Once fat cells form, they remain in your body forever. Although you can reduce the size of fat cells, you cannot get rid of them.\n",
      "Treatment": "Weight reduction is achieved by:\nStructured approaches and therapies to reduce weight include:\nTypes of surgical procedures include:\n\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you need help losing weight. Also call if you have any of the symptoms or complications of obesity.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Others, however, find it difficult to maintain the weight loss for long. Most people return to their pretreatment weight within five years.\n",

      "What Is It?": "In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a person is troubled by intrusive, distressing thoughts (obsessions) and feels the pressure to carry out repetitive behaviors (compulsions).\nNeuroscientists believe that the brain pathways involved with judgment, planning and body movement are altered in OCD. Environmental influences, such as family relationships or stressful events, can trigger or worsen OCD symptoms.\nOCD affects up to 3% of people worldwide. A childhood onset form can start around 10 years of age, more commonly in boys than girls. Most of the remainder of people with OCD have their first symptoms before they turn 25 — in this group, women outnumber men. OCD symptoms don't usually develop after age 30.\nThere is strong evidence that the illness has a genetic (inherited) basis, particularly in the childhood onset type.\nSometimes people with OCD manage their obsessions without giving any external sign that they are suffering. Usually, however, they try to relieve their obsessions by performing some type of compulsion: a repeated behavior or mental action that is aimed at soothing the fears. For example, a woman who has the obsession that her hands are dirty may develop the compulsion to wash them 50 times a day. A man who fears that his front door is unlocked may feel compelled to check the lock 10 or 20 times each night.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The two defining symptoms of OCD are obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions. The symptoms are bad enough to be time-consuming, cause functional impairment or be significantly distressing.\nObsessions are persistent, repeated, anxiety-provoking or distressing thoughts that intrude into a person's consciousness. Obsessions vary and can relate to any kind of fear. Here are some common ones:\nOften, an adult with OCD will recognize that the obsessive thoughts are not realistic and will try to ignore them or suppress them. Temporary relief may come by performing a compulsive action.\nCompulsions are persistent, repetitive behaviors or mental acts. The goal is to reduce the anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts. The compulsions are not realistically connected to the source of anxiety. Examples include:\nAnyone may feel compelled to recheck a locked door or wash hands to assure cleanliness. By themselves, such behaviors do not mean a person has OCD.\nIn OCD, the obsessions and compulsions are excessive and distressing. They are time-consuming, sometimes eating up several hours each day. They may interfere with personal relationships, as well as performance at work or school. Some compulsions may cause physical injury. For example, compulsive hand washing can lead to chapped hands and dermatitis, while excessive tooth brushing can cause torn, bleeding gums.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Some people with OCD seek help from a primary care physician when symptoms begin to affect their health or interfere with life. An adult with compulsive hand washing may visit a dermatologist because of cracked, bleeding fingers, or a parent may consult a pediatrician when a child with OCD begins to be controlled by particularly intense rituals (for example, counting or checking).\nDepressed mood is very common in OCD. In fact, a person may talk about feeling depressed instead of discussing OCD symptoms that are embarrassing or otherwise difficult to describe.\nYour primary care doctor will likely refer you to a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment.\nA mental health clinician will diagnose OCD by asking you about\nMost people with OCD know that their thoughts and behaviors are unrealistic. A significant minority have poor insight into their symptoms and a few have no insight. OCD with poor or no insight is harder to treat.\nA significant minority of people with OCD have symptoms of a tic disorder or may have had a tic disorder in the past.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "OCD rarely disappears spontaneously, and the symptoms may last for years if not treated properly. In fact, it is common for a person with OCD to have the problem for 5 to 10 years before seeing a psychiatrist. Getting help sooner can reduce the impact of the illness.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent OCD, but the negative effects can be limited if the illness is detected and treated early.\n",
      "Treatment": "The most effective treatment for OCD is to combine psychotherapy and medications.\nYour doctor may also offer treatment for any other conditions that may be contributing to the problem, such as a medical problem or depression. You may need to try more than one approach before you find the one that is right for you.\n",
      "Psychotherapy": "A number of psychotherapy techniques may be helpful, depending on the person's preference, events that may have triggered the problem, and the availability of family and other social support. It's important for a person suffering with OCD to be educated about the illness and to get support from friends, family or support groups.\nThe available research suggests that exposure and response prevention (ERP) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) work best. CBT is designed to help a person with OCD recognize the unreasonableness of the fearful, obsessive thinking. ERP is one of several techniques aimed at extinguishing compulsions.\nPsychodynamic, insight-oriented or interpersonal psychotherapy can help a person sort out conflicts in important relationships or explore the history behind the symptoms, though insight itself is not likely to have an impact on severe symptoms.\nFamily therapy and group therapy also have been used in OCD. Since this disorder can be very disruptive to family life, family therapy may be particularly helpful.\n",
      "Antidepressant Medications": "Some antidepressants are effective for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Doses used are usually higher than the doses used to treat other illnesses like depression or anxiety. It also commonly takes longer before a person gets relief.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluvoxamine (Luvox), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro) are most commonly used.\nTricyclic antidepressants also can be effective. The one most used for OCD is clomipramine (Anafranil). Although this drug may be slightly more effective than the SSRIs for treating OCD, it sometimes has side effects that are more difficult to tolerate. Nonetheless, it is a good option.\nEspecially for people with poor or no insight into their illness, the doctor may offer an antipsychotic medication in addition to an antidepressant. Possible options are risperidone (Risperdal) and aripiprazole (Abilify). Such medications may also be used for severe OCD that hasn't gotten better with antidepressant treatment.\n",
      "Neurostimulation": "Deep-brain stimulation is used in the rare cases when OCD is resistant to all of the above treatments. In this technique, a neurosurgeon implants ultra-thin electrodes deep in the brain in order to stimulate a specific region thought to be involved with OCD symptoms.\nThis treatment is only offered for a person who has persistent incapacitating symptoms after receiving several ERP sessions, several adequate trials of antidepressants and augmentation with an antipsychotic.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Since the symptoms of OCD seldom disappear without treatment, you should contact your primary care doctor whenever obsessive thoughts or compulsions cause you significant distress or discomfort, interfere with your ability to have a normal life at home or work, or cause you injury. Your primary care doctor will refer you to a psychiatrist for appropriate and effective treatment.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Since OCD can be a chronic (long-lasting) condition, ongoing treatment may be necessary.\nThe outlook however is good. Most patients improve and some recover completely.\n",

      "What is it?": "Onycholysis is the separation of a fingernail or toenail from its pink nail bed. The separation occurs gradually and is painless.\nThe most common cause of onycholysis is trauma. Even slight trauma can cause onycholysis when it happens repetitively — for example, the daily tapping of long fingernails on a keyboard or counter. Onycholysis also can be caused by manicure tools that are pushed beneath the nail to clear dirt or smooth the nail.  Too much moisture also can cause the problem.\nSome medical conditions can cause onycholysis, generally by changing the nail's shape or the contour of the soft tissue bed beneath it. In these situations, the nail cannot attach smoothly to the nail bed.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A nail that has lifted from its bed at its end can have an irregular border between the pink portion of the nail and the white outside edge of the nail. A greater portion of the nail is opaque, either whitened or discolored to yellow or green. Depending on the cause of onycholysis, the nail may have collected thickened skin underneath the edge of its nail plate, and the nail plate may have a deformed shape with pits or indentations in the nail surface, a bent nail edge or coarse thickening of the nail.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will be able to confirm that you have onycholysis by examining your fingernails or toenails. If the cause of onycholysis is not obvious, your doctor will note additional characteristics of your nails, such as their shape and color, the presence of indentations in the nail surface, and the appearance of the skin under and around the nail. He or she also will examine you to check for evidence of skin rashes or thyroid problems.\nIf your doctor suspects that a fungal infection is the cause of nail changes, he or she might scrape a sample of tissue from beneath the nail plate. This sample can be tested in a laboratory to check for fungus.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Nails are slow to grow and take time to repair themselves. The portion of nail that has separated from the skin surface beneath it will not reattach. Onycholysis only goes away after new nail has replaced the affected area. It takes four to six months for a fingernail to fully regrow, and twice as long for toenails. Some nail problems are difficult to cure and may affect the nail appearance permanently.\n",
      "Prevention": "Some preventive measures will make onycholysis less likely to occur:\n",
      "Treatment": "Because the portion of nail that has lifted away from its bed may catch on edges when you move abruptly, it is a good idea to trim the nail close to the place where it separates from the nail bed. A physician can help you do this.\nTreatment for onycholysis depends on the cause of the problem:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Onycholysis is not an urgent problem and can be discussed with your doctor during a routine visit.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Nail changes are usually not permanent, but they can take many months to go away even after effective treatment.\n",

      "What is it?": "Papilledema is the swelling of the optic nerve as it enters the back of the eye due to raised intracranial pressure. Fluid surrounding the brain is constantly produced and reabsorbed, maintaining just enough intracranial pressure to help protect the brain if there is blunt head trauma.\nWhen you have a headache or unexplained nausea and vomiting, your doctor will look into your eye with an ophthalmoscope. This handheld instrument shines a bright light into your eye. Changes in the appearance of the optic nerve and the blood vessels that pass through it can be seen through the ophthalmoscope and might be related to the source of your symptoms.\nThe anatomy of the optic nerve makes it a sensitive marker for problems inside the brain. This nerve connects the back of each eyeball and its retina to the brain. In its short span between the brain and the eye, the optic nerve's whole surface is bathed in cerebral spinal fluid. This fluid protects the nerve from sudden movement.\nHowever, even slight increases in the pressure of this fluid, from swelling of the brain, can compress the optic nerve around its whole circumference in a \"choking\" manner. When this nerve is exposed to high pressure, or when it develops inflammation on its own, it can bulge into the back wall of the eyeball, causing papilledema.\n\nDoctors have commonly used the term to describe the appearance independent of the underlying cause. The term papilledema ideally should be reserved for swelling of the nerve head when the swelling is caused by elevated intracranial pressure. Other conditions can have a similar appearance to papilledema caused by high intracranial pressure.\nSome important causes of increased pressure from cerebral spinal fluid and papilledema are brain tumors and brain infections, such as a brain abscess, meningitis, or encephalitis. A significant proportion of people who are diagnosed with brain tumors have some evidence of papilledema. A pressure increase resulting from bleeding or from very high blood pressure also can cause papilledema.\nOne condition can cause increased pressure in the cerebral spinal fluid without associated swelling of the brain or ventricles. This condition, called idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri, is caused when the body makes too much spinal fluid. It is more common in women who are obese and of childbearing age. The condition seems to be triggered at times that the body is adjusting to hormone changes, such as pregnancy, the start of birth control pills, the first menstrual period, or menopause.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms related to papilledema caused by increased pressure include headache and nausea with vomiting and a machinery-like sound. Twenty-five percent of people with advanced severe papilledema also will develop some visual symptoms. Typically, the visual changes are recurring brief episodes lasting less than 30 seconds in which the vision turns gray or black, sometimes described as if a veil has fallen over the eyes. The symptoms usually affect both eyes at once.\nVisual blackouts often are triggered by a change in position, such as by standing up very suddenly, or they may be triggered by coughing or straining in the chest or abdomen. Occasionally, people with papilledema can have an experience of flashing lights, often seen in an arc shape. Other visual changes occur over time, including a smaller field of vision with a larger blind spot and, ultimately, blindness, if successful treatment is not given.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The front end of the optic nerve is visible at the back of the eye when your doctor or an eye specialist looks through the pupil with an ophthalmoscope. The round, front end is just over 1.5 millimeters in size. Normally, the end of the nerve, called the optic disc, has a crisp outline and is indented slightly. If the optic disc appears elevated and has a blurred outside edge, your doctor can diagnose papilledema. The pressure within the nerve can cause the draining veins in your eye to become congested.\nAlso, very tiny pulsations that normally are seen in the eye's veins tend to disappear. When papilledema is severe, small red spots from local bleeding or spotty color changes on the retina from accumulated debris or from damaged retina cells may be seen. Papilledema due to raised intracranial pressure is almost always bilateral.\nThe physical exam also will include a check of your field of vision. Papilledema causes each eye to have a wider blind spot near the nose, and it narrows the peripheral (edge) vision. To check your visual field, your doctor may compare your vision abilities to his or her own by sitting across from you and moving fingers in and out of view. Visual fields can be tested more formally by an ophthalmologist using vision grids.\nFindings that show you have papilledema indicate a very abnormal problem that usually needs immediate medical attention. The concern is less about vision loss. Papilledema from increased brain pressure usually does not damage the optic nerve, except when it is high pressure over a long time. The concern is damage to the brain; the brain swelling can sometimes be life-threatening. Brain imaging should be performed urgently either with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nIf there is no abnormality on the brain scan, most patients will need to have a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) done so that the pressure of the cerebral spinal fluid can be measured. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) is a common cause of papilledema when the brain scan is normal.\n",
      "Expected duration": "After the cause of papilledema is identified and treated, and any pressure increase in the spinal fluid has returned to normal, optic disk swelling gradually will go away over six to eight weeks. When a pressure increase requires longer treatment, as in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, symptoms can take longer to clear.\n",
      "Prevention": "Many of the causes of papilledema cannot be prevented. Steps to help prevent some causes of papilledema include:\n",
      "Treatment": "The choice of treatment of papilledema depends upon its cause.\nIf a brain tumor is diagnosed, a biopsy (by surgery) may be required as the first step. Treatment of a brain tumor depends on the location and size. Treatment might include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or a combination of these. High blood pressure should be managed as an emergency in the hospital if it results in papilledema.\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension can be treated with repeated spinal taps to remove excess spinal fluid, or with a medication called acetazolamide (Diamox and other brand names). This medicine causes the body to make less cerebral spinal fluid and returns the central nervous system's pressure to normal. Weight loss is encouraged and is helpful. A few patients will require surgery to help extra spinal fluid drain if they do not do well with initial treatment. Because idiopathic intracranial hypertension is often a long-lasting condition that has the potential to damage vision, monitoring by an ophthalmologist is an important part of the treatment.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have a headache that is accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and you do not know the cause, it is important for you to contact your doctor immediately. It is particularly important to have these symptoms evaluated if you have a fever, high blood pressure, or if you have recently started taking birth control pills or are pregnant.\n",
      "Prognosis": "You may have mild papilledema for months or years and still not lose significant vision. However, once you begin to lose vision, it can become permanent within days or weeks, and requires urgent treatment.\n",

      "What is it?": "Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common, temporary condition that causes knee pain in older children and teenagers, especially those who play sports and apply excessive stress to the patellar tendon (which connects the lower end of the knee cap to the upper part of the lower leg).\nDuring activities that include a lot of jumping and bending — hockey, basketball, volleyball, soccer, skating, gymnastics, or ballet — the quadriceps muscle (thigh muscle) pulls tightly against the kneecap and the kneecap's anchor, the patellar tendon. The fibers of the patellar tendon are attached to the shinbone (tibia). With repeated pulling against these fiber connections, the tendon can become inflamed at or near its bone attachment. The result is pain and swelling at the tibial tuberosity, which is a raised area at the top of the shinbone. The tibial tuberosity is where the patellar tendon attaches to the bone.\nThis connection between the tendon and tibia is particularly vulnerable to stress and injury during times when the bone is growing rapidly and the patellar tendon is relatively short. For this reason, symptoms of Osgood-Schlatter disease usually appear between the ages of 9 and 14, during or after the teenage growth spurt. Overall, about 10% of children ages 12 to 15 experience Osgood-Schlatter disease, but it may affect up to 20% of adolescent athletes. The problem is more common in boys, though it appears to be increasing in frequency among girls as their participation in sports increases. In most cases, symptoms of Osgood-Schlatter disease develop gradually as a result of repeated stress on the patellar tendon. Less often, the condition is caused by a single trauma to the knee.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of Osgood-Schlatter disease include:\nThe pain from Osgood-Schlatter disease can be a mild pain that lasts only while playing sports, or it can be a constant pain that severely limits regular participation in athletic activities. Pain can occur during stair climbing, kneeling, squatting or kicking. Pain usually appears in only one knee, although in about 20% to 30% of cases, both knees are affected.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may suspect that you have Osgood-Schlatter disease because of your age, your knee symptoms and, in many cases, your sports history. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will examine your knee to look for pain, tenderness, swelling and redness, and to check the range of movement that you have in your joint. He or she also will check the range of motion of your hip.\nIf the diagnosis is not obvious, your doctor may order knee X-rays. These X-rays might show tiny bone fragments that have separated from the top of your shinbone or abnormal areas of calcium deposits in the patellar tendon. If your pain is constant, or your knee tenderness is not confined to one spot, your doctor also may use these X-rays to look for other problems, such as a fracture, tumor or infection.\nIn some cases, your doctor may order an ultrasound or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to further evaluate the patellar tendon.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Pain from Osgood-Schlatter disease can be very temporary for some people, but most people have symptoms for months. It is typical for this condition to last six to 18 months.\n",
      "Prevention": "You may help to prevent tendon injury by doing warm-up exercises before playing sports, especially exercises that stretch your thigh (quadriceps), hamstring and calf muscles. Use of appropriate sports equipment, proper technique, modifications in training intensity and avoiding \"specialization\" in a single sport at a young age may be helpful.\n",
      "Treatment": "Osgood-Schlatter disease eventually goes away on its own. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms.\nAlthough it may be uncomfortable for you to participate in activities that cause knee pain, it is not dangerous for you to do so. Continuing your activity can help you to maintain strength in your quadriceps and hamstring muscles, which is an important part of your recovery. During activities, you can do the following to help to limit your symptoms:\nIf your knee pain is constant, it may be necessary for you to stop playing sports for a while, or to wear a brace for six to eight weeks. Casts and other immobilizers are avoided whenever possible, because they may cause muscles to weaken and this can delay your eventual recovery. Consultation with a physical therapist may be recommended.\nAn injection of hyperosmolar dextrose may be recommended; these are usually performed by a sports medicine specialist or orthopedic surgeon.\nSurgery may be helpful if conservative treatments are not effective.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you have symptoms that are typical for this condition, so that your diagnosis can be confirmed. Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist or an orthopedic doctor for continued care.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Major symptoms from Osgood-Schlatter disease typically go away before age 18, or when a teenager's growth spurt ends and the bones mature. The condition may leave a permanent painless bump below the knee. In the years after recovery, about 60% of adults who once experienced Osgood-Schlatter disease have some pain with kneeling.\n",

      "What is it?": "Inside a joint, a tissue called cartilage cushions the joint and prevents the bones from rubbing against each other. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage of a joint erodes (breaks down). Bones begin to rub against each other, causing pain and difficulty moving the joint. Osteoarthritis also can affect nearby bones, which can become enlarged in places. These enlargements are called bone spurs or osteophytes.\nAlthough the term arthritis means joint inflammation, there is relatively little inflammation in the joints of most people with osteoarthritis. For this reason, and because this type of arthritis seems to be caused by age-related degeneration of the joints, many experts and health care professionals prefer to call it degenerative joint disease.\nOsteoarthritis can range from mild to severe. The pain associated with osteoarthritis can be significant and it usually is made worse by movement. Osteoarthritis can be limited to one joint or start in one joint usually the knee, hip, hand, foot or spine or it can involve a number of joints. If the hand is affected, usually many joints of the fingers become arthritic.\nOsteoarthritis probably does not have a single cause, and, for most people, no cause can be identified. Age is a leading risk factor, because osteoarthritis usually occurs as people get older. However, research suggests that joints do not always deteriorate as people age. Other factors seem to contribute to osteoarthritis. Sports-related injuries or repeated small injuries caused by repeated movements on the job may increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis. Genetics also plays a role. Obesity seems to increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis of the knees.\n\nOther factors that increase the risk of osteoarthritis include:\nOne theory is that some people are born with defective cartilage or slight defects in the way joints fit, and as these people age, they are more likely to have cartilage in the joint break down.\nWomen are affected by osteoarthritis slightly more often than are men.\nOsteoarthritis is one of the most common medical conditions, affecting an estimated 15.8 million people in the United States. In many people, it goes unrecognized. It is estimated that as many as half of all those who have osteoarthritis do not know that the pain and stiffness they are experiencing are symptoms of osteoarthritis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of osteoarthritis include:\nPeople who have osteoarthritis often complain of a deep ache, centered in the joint. Typically, the pain is aggravated by using the joint and relieved by rest. However, as the disease worsens, the pain becomes more constant. Often, when the pain is significant during the night, it interferes with sleep.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may ask about osteoarthritis in your parents, because osteoarthritis appears to have a genetic component.\nHe or she will examine you, looking for tenderness, warmth and swelling around the joint or joints. Your doctor may order X-rays, but osteoarthritis may not be apparent in its earliest stages and many people have osteoarthritis by x-ray in joints despite having no symptoms. Your health care professional also may order blood tests to look for evidence of another arthritic condition.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Osteoarthritis is a long-lasting condition that usually gets worse slowly over time.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no reliable way to prevent most cases of osteoarthritis. However, you may be able to control some factors that increase the risk of developing the disease. You can\nIt may also help to prevent or treating any conditions that might contribute to joint damage, such as hemochromatosis, gout, or infection.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment focuses on managing pain and maintaining the ability to use the joint.\nAn over-the-counter painkiller, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), can help to ease pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn and others) also may help. However, NSAIDs may be unsafe for people at high risk of developing ulcers, including people who have had ulcers in the past and the elderly. For these people, newer medications called cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, such as celecoxib (Celebrex), may be less irritating to the stomach and intestines but has similar effectiveness as older medicines. Stomach problems, including ulcers, are the most common side effects of these medications but there are others, including an increased risk of cardiovascular problems.\nIn some instances, when inflammation is significant, your health care professional may remove fluid from the joint and inject the joint with a corticosteroid drug. However, these drugs can damage the joint if they are used too much, so your health care professional will limit their use.\nAnother approved treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee is hyaluronate injections. Hyaluronate is a natural substance in joints that provides lubrication.  The injectable hyaluronate drugs are synthesized forms that can be injected one time or weekly for three to five weeks. Some studies suggest that these injections help, although others have found no benefit.\nStudies also suggest that an over-the-counter supplement called glucosamine sulfate is safe and may provide modest benefit to people with osteoarthritis of the knees. However, there is no compelling evidence that joint deterioration can be slowed or stopped by treatment with glucosamine. Over-the-counter creams containing capsaicin applied to the skin over painful joints also may help.\nApplying heat or cold can relieve pain temporarily. Your doctor also can advise you on the use of heating pads, hot baths and ice packs to ease the discomfort.\nYour doctor likely will suggest that you perform certain exercises to reduce stiffness and improve your ability to move the joints. Because extra pounds put pressure on sensitive joints, it is important that you lose excess weight. In addition, if you have osteoarthritis of the spine, it is important to maintain good posture to distribute weight and pressure evenly throughout the body.

      "What is it?": "Osteoporosis is a bone disorder. The bones become thinner. They lose some of their strength and are more likely to break. People with osteoporosis have a higher risk of fractures.\nBones can fracture even during everyday movements, such as bending or coughing. The most common osteoporotic fractures occur in the wrist, hip and spine.\nOsteoporosis can cause a great deal of suffering, including loss of independence. Death may even occur as the result of complications of an osteoporotic hip fracture.\nOsteoporosis is much more common in women than in men. This is because of the hormonal changes that occur during menopause.\nOsteoporosis is not a form of arthritis. However, it can cause fractures that lead to arthritis.\n\n",
      "Risk factors": "You are more likely to develop osteoporosis if you:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most people with osteoporosis do not have any symptoms. They do not know they have osteoporosis until they have a bone density test or a fracture.\nOne early sign can be a loss of height caused by curvature or compression of the spine. Curvature or compression is caused by weakened vertebrae (spine bones). The weakened vertebrae develop tiny breaks called compression fractures.\nCompression fractures cause the spine bones to collapse vertically. When this happens, the vertebrae become shorter. The shape of each single vertebra goes from a normal rectangle to a more triangular form.\nCompression fractures can cause back pain or aching. But the loss of height usually does not cause any symptoms.\n\nOsteoporosis usually does not cause pain unless a bone is fractured.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "During a physical exam, your doctor may find that you are shorter than you thought you were. Or, your doctor may notice a \"dowager's hump.\" This is a curve of the spine in the upper back that produces a hump.\nX-rays may show that your bones are less dense than expected. This could be caused by osteoporosis. But there are also other possible causes, such as not enough vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency is common and easily diagnosed with a blood test.\nYour doctor will suspect osteoporosis if you have had a fragility fracture or other risk factors for the disease.\nA bone density test can confirm an osteoporosis diagnosis. Several techniques measure bone density.\nThe most accurate bone density test is DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). DEXA takes 10 to 15 minutes and is painless. It uses minimal amounts of radiation and generally is done on the spine and hip.\nOther tests are available to screen for osteoporosis, though they are not in widespread use. These include ultrasound of the heel and quantitative computed tomography.\n\n",
      "Expected duration": "Osteoporosis is a long-term (chronic) condition. But proper treatment can lead to significant improvements in bone mass. It can decrease the likelihood that a fracture will occur.\nBone mass usually does not return to normal after treatment. But the risk of fracture may decrease dramatically after treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent osteoporosis by:\nIf you are a woman who has recently entered menopause, talk to your doctor about being evaluated for osteoporosis.\n",
      "Preventive medications": "There are several medications to prevent menopause-related osteoporosis. These include:\nEstrogen slows the breakdown of bone. The loss of estrogen during menopause leads to bone loss. Estrogen therapy helps to counteract this process. However, estrogen replacement therapy has fallen out of favor. That is because of side effects, including an increased risk of heart disease and stroke when taken by women more than 10 years past menopause.\nAlendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid are bisphosphonates. This family of drugs slows down the breakdown of bone. They can help bone to become thicker.\nIf a bone density test shows signs of a problem, it may help you to decide whether to begin taking a preventive medication. You should also measure your height every year, especially if you are a woman older than age 40.\nToo much thyroid medication may lead to osteoporosis and other medical problems. Monitor thyroid medication regularly if you take it.\nIf you take prednisone, work with your doctor to reduce the dose to the lowest possible amount or to discontinue the medication.\n",
      "Treatment": "Doctors initially treat osteoporosis by:\nFor women, many medications are available to treat osteoporosis. These include:\nLong-term estrogen therapy can help slow the breakdown of bone. However, it is rarely recommended solely for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis because the risks usually outweigh the potential benefits. The risks of long-term estrogen therapy include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, and gallstones.\nAmong men, advanced age and low levels of testosterone are the most common risk factors for developing osteoporosis. Testing can reveal if testosterone levels are low. In this case, other tests will look for the cause so that treatment can be started, including testosterone therapy. Men also can be treated with a bisphosphonate or teriparatide.\nYour doctor will monitor how well your treatment is working. He or she will do this by taking bone density measurements every one to two years.\n",
      "Treating fractures": "If a person with osteoporosis fractures a hip, surgery may be needed. Surgery will realign and stabilize the hip.\nA wrist fracture may heal well simply by being put in a cast. Sometimes surgery may be needed to restore proper alignment of the bones.\nOther treatments for fracture include pain medication and rest for a short time.\nCalcitonin injections may reduce spine pain from a new compression fracture.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Review your options for evaluation and treatment with your doctor if you have:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for people with osteoporosis is good, especially if the problem is detected and treated early. Bone density, even in severe osteoporosis, generally can be stabilized or improved. The risk of fractures can be substantially reduced with treatment.\nPeople with mild osteoporosis have an excellent outlook. Those who have a fracture can expect their bones to heal normally. The pain usually goes away within a week or two.\nIn some people, osteoporosis has a clear cause. The outlook is especially good if the cause is identified and corrected.\n",

      "What is Paget's disease?": "Bones in your body continuously break down and form again in a natural and tightly balanced process called bone remodeling. Bone remodeling also occurs in response to stress or injury placed on the bone. For example, weight-bearing exercise leads to increased bone formation.\nIn Paget's disease, more bone breaks down than usual and more new bone forms than usual. These changes in the bone can lead to bone enlargement and deformity. The new bone growth tends to be softer and more fragile than normal bone and can develop in a haphazard pattern. Because of this, the bone can fracture. The long bones, especially the legs, tend to bow, and the skull may enlarge, particularly the forehead.\nPaget's disease is the second most common bone disorder in people over 50, after osteoporosis. It is rarely diagnosed in young adults.\nAlthough the cause is unknown, genetics may play a role because the disease sometimes runs in families. Research suggests a slow-growing virus may trigger the disease; some cells in the bone of people with Paget's disease look like they are infected with a virus. However, no virus has been identified.\nThe condition is rare in certain parts of the world, such as Japan, but more common in the United States and Australia. In the United States, an estimated 10% of people older than age 80 have Paget's disease.\nIn about 20% of people with Paget's disease, only one area of the body – the spine, pelvis, thigh, lower leg, or skull – is affected. The rest have many areas involved. In serious cases, complications can include deafness, congestive heart failure (caused by the extra blood flow required by the diseased bone), an elevated calcium level, and cancer of the bone.\n",
      "Symptoms of Paget's disease": "An estimated 70% of people with Paget's disease do not have any symptoms. Symptoms are more likely to occur in people who have many areas of the body affected. Symptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing Paget's disease": "Because many people with Paget's disease do not have symptoms, the condition often is not discovered until an x-ray or blood test (called the alkaline phosphatase) obtained for other reasons suggests the disease may be present.\nIf your doctor thinks you may have Paget's disease, specific blood and urine tests can measure the levels of certain byproducts of bone formation and breakdown. More detailed x-rays or a bone scan also may be done.\nIn rare instances, a doctor may recommend a bone biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other possibilities. In a bone biopsy, a small piece of bone is removed with a needle so it can be examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration of Paget's disease": "Paget's disease cannot be cured, but treatment (if necessary) can control the symptoms.\n",
      "Preventing Paget's disease": "There is no way to prevent Paget's disease.\n",
      "Treating Paget's disease": "Most people with Paget's disease do not need treatment, as treatment is generally reserved for people with symptoms. In some cases a doctor may recommend treatment even if you don't have symptoms, if imaging tests (such as a bone scan) and blood tests detect enough disease, especially if it is in areas of bone where complications may be likely (such as the skull, spine, or near joints).\nMedications, including aspirin, mild pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory drugs can help treat pain and inflammation. In advanced cases, your doctor may recommend medications such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), zoledronic acid (Reclast, Zometa), or calcitonin (Miacalcin) to reduce the activity of cells that remodel bone.\nSurgery to correct deformities is rarely necessary. If Paget's disease causes significant damage to a hip, hip replacement surgery may be considered. Hearing aids may be helpful if Paget's disease affects the bones inside the ear.\nA person with Paget's disease will be monitored carefully for complications such as heart failure or an elevation in blood calcium, and these conditions will be treated if necessary.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if you experience any of the symptoms of Paget's disease for more than two weeks.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Paget's disease is a long-lasting (chronic) condition. The outlook is generally good, especially if the condition is diagnosed and treated before major changes in bones have occurred.\n",

      "What is it?": "You accidentally touch a hot stove. In a millisecond, you jerk your hand away. What just happened?\nYou have pain receptors throughout your body, both outside and within. These receptors send electrical messages through your spinal cord to the brain. You only become aware of pain after your brain receives and interprets these electrical messages. In some cases, such as when you touch a hot stove, the body can spring into defensive action even before the brain knows what is happening. That's because pain messages that reach the spinal cord can cause an automatic reflex response, making muscles near the source of the pain contract to get away from the pain.\nPain receptors and nerve pathways differ throughout the body. Therefore, the sensation of pain differs, too, depending on where the message comes from and how it travels. At times, the source of pain is difficult to locate. For example, some people feel the pain from a heart attack in the neck or jaw. People also differ in their ability to tolerate pain and how they respond to pain medication.\nPain is classified into two types:\nAcute pain is generally useful. It's a clear sign of danger. Examples include touching a hot surface, stubbing your toe or being cut.\nChronic pain can outlive its usefulness; the message has been sent and received, but keeps being sent over and over. Examples include arthritis, cancer and back injuries.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Pain is the symptom. Acute pain often has a clear source and may be described as  sharp, radiating, stabbing or boring. Chronic pain is more persistent, lasting months or years, and it may or may not have an obvious source and more often described as throbbing or aching. In some cases, it is accompanied by numbness or tingling.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "To diagnose the cause of pain, doctors usually try to determine the intensity of the pain and what's causing the pain. This can be challenging. No laboratory test can prove that pain exists, and describing pain in words can be difficult. Also, each person experiences pain differently.\nYour doctor may ask you questions about the history of your pain. He or she may ask you to describe your pain using a scale, such as 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain), or use other scales and measurements. Once your doctor determines whether your pain is acute or chronic, and uncovers the source of the pain, he or she can determine the best way to treat it. However, doctors often begin treating pain before they identify the cause.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long pain lasts will depend on its source and severity.\n",
      "Prevention": "Trying to prevent pain before it happens can be dangerous. Acute pain is an important message that is essential to survival. Some people are born with a rare disorder (congenital analgesia) and do not feel pain. They live in great danger because they miss warning signals that could mean life or death.\nOnce the cause of pain is diagnosed, it may be possible to prevent the pain from coming back. For instance, a person diagnosed with a stomach ulcer can take medications to heal the ulcer and prevent continuation of the pain.\n",
      "Treatment": "Your doctor probably will treat your pain while he or she tries to figure out the cause. Many drugs are helpful, though how well they work depends on the patient and the nature of pain.\nAnalgesics (painkillers) are the most common pain remedy. Acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brand names) interferes with pain messages. Aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) work in two ways: 1) by interfering with pain messages, and 2) by reducing inflammation, swelling and irritation that can make pain worse. Topical pain relievers (such as lidocaine patches, IcyHot, Aspercreme or BenGay) may lessen pain by numbing the area, reducing inflammation or  causing a form of skin irritation that \"distracts\" the brain from focusing on pain.\nNarcotic pain relievers, such as morphine and codeine, are the most powerful pain treatments. These usually are reserved for the most intense pain. They can cause serious side effects, can be addictive and often cause constipation.\nOther drugs such as anesthetics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and corticosteroids may work against certain types of pain.\nSometimes medications are injected directly into the region of pain or near a nerve to interrupt the pain signal.\nNon-drug treatments for pain include:\nNon-drug treatments may be especially useful for people with chronic pain. In some cases, these treatments may stimulate natural painkillers, called endorphins, which are created within the body. In other cases, non-drug treatments work directly on nerves to interfere with pain messages. Sometimes, it isn't clear why the pain stops.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Pain means some kind of problem exists. And while different people tolerate different degrees of pain, you should never ignore pain. Consult a doctor if you cannot determine why you are experiencing pain, if pain continues or if it doesn't respond to simple treatment.\n",
      "Prognosis": "For people with acute pain, the outlook is usually good. Many drugs are effective in relieving pain. When the cause of the pain is removed, the pain subsides.\nPeople with chronic pain may have a more difficult time. The sources of pain can be hard to find and difficult to treat, and pain may continue even after its causes are addressed. Chronic pain can cause complications such as sleep disorders, loss of appetite and depression. Doctors are learning more about the causes and treatment of chronic pain, but chronic pain sufferers may need to learn to cope with pain for a long time. Lifestyle changes and non-drug treatments may need to become a part of daily life.\n",

      "What is it?": "Pain during or after sexual intercourse is known as dyspareunia. Although this problem can affect men, it is more common in women. Women with dyspareunia may have pain in the vagina, clitoris or labia. There are numerous causes of dyspareunia, many of which are treatable. Common causes include the following:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Women with dyspareunia may feel superficial pain at the entrance of the vagina, or deeper pain during penetration or thrusting of the penis. Some women also may experience severe tightening of the vaginal muscles during penetration, a condition called vaginismus.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Dyspareunia typically is diagnosed based on your symptoms. Your medical and sexual history and your physical examination will help your doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms.\nDistinguishing pain that occurs with touching the genitals or early penetration from pain that occurs with deeper penetration is a clue to the cause of your symptoms. Therefore, your doctor will ask you questions about the exact location, length and timing of your pain. He or she also will ask you:\nIn addition:\nDuring the physical examination, your doctor will check your vaginal wall for signs of dryness, inflammation, infection (especially yeast or herpes infection), genital warts and scarring. Your doctor also will do an internal pelvic examination to look for abnormal pelvic masses, tenderness or signs of endometriosis. He or she also may suggest that you speak with a counselor to determine whether a history of sexual abuse, trauma or anxiety may be contributing to your symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long your symptoms last depends on the cause. If you have vaginal dryness from inadequate lubrication, the symptoms will improve rapidly if you use a commercially available lubricant or if you are more aroused before intercourse. If you have vaginal dryness from atrophic vaginitis, your symptoms will improve with an estrogen cream placed in the vagina. You should discuss this with your physician.\nOral estrogen therapy can increase the risk of breast cancer and heart disease, but vaginal formulas are considered safe for most people. If you have a urinary tract or vaginal yeast infection, the dyspareunia typically goes away within one week of antibiotic or antifungal therapy. If you have a sexually transmitted disease, you may need longer, more intensive treatments with antibiotics to clear the condition. Skin diseases usually will improve with the use of steroid creams, but often require long-term treatment. If you have had symptoms of dyspareunia for months or years, and psychological factors play a role, you may need prolonged counseling before your symptoms are relieved.\n",
      "Prevention": "Although some causes of dyspareunia, such as a history of sexual abuse or trauma, can't be avoided, other causes can be prevented:\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cause of dyspareunia:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Although sexual intercourse may be uncomfortable the very first time, it should never be painful. If you suddenly begin having pain before, during or after intercourse, see your doctor. It is important to seek care early, before you begin to avoid sexual intercourse or feel anxious in anticipation of your partner.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many causes of dyspareunia are rooted in a physical condition that can be cured or controlled with proper medical care. However, women with longstanding dyspareunia or a history of sexual abuse or trauma may need counseling to help manage the symptoms.\n",

      "What is it?": "Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, the large gland located behind the stomach. Pancreatitis can be acute, chronic, or recurrent.\nThe main function of the pancreas is to produce digestive enzymes and hormones, such as insulin, that regulate blood sugar levels.\nMost cases of pancreatitis are caused by:\nOther causes of pancreatitis include:\nSometimes the underlying cause of chronic pancreatitis cannot be identified.\nAcute pancreatitis.In acute pancreatitis, enzymes that normally are released into the digestive tract stay within the pancreas and begin to damage it. The pancreas becomes swollen and inflamed. More enzymes are then released into the surrounding tissues and bloodstream.\nAs a result, digestion slows down and becomes painful. Other body functions can also be affected.\nIn some uncommon cases, a single, severe episode of acute pancreatitis can cause enough damage that the disease becomes chronic.\nChronic and recurrent pancreatitis.The pancreas can become permanently damaged and scarred if attacks are severe, prolonged, or frequent.\nDamage to the pancreas can cause problems with digestion, absorption of nutrients, and production of insulin. As a result, people with chronic pancreatitis can lose weight, experience diarrhea, become malnourished with vitamin deficiencies, or develop diabetes. It usually takes several years for permanent changes and symptoms to occur.\nMost cases of pancreatitis are caused by overuse of alcohol. It is generally thought that people who continue to drink after one or more bouts of alcohol-related acute pancreatitis are more likely to develop chronic pancreatitis. However, only a small minority of people that drink alcohol, even in large amounts, develop chronic pancreatitis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is upper abdominal pain. It can range from tolerable to severe.\nOnce the pain begins, it quickly reaches its maximum intensity, often within 30 minutes. In alcohol-induced pancreatitis, the pain tends to begin one to three days after a binge.\nIt may be difficult to find a comfortable position. Bending over or lying on your side may reduce the pain. Eating usually makes the pain worse.\nOther symptoms of acute pancreatitis include\nIn severe cases, fever, difficulty breathing, weakness, and shock may develop.\nThe symptoms of chronic pancreatitis are similar but usually less severe. The pain can occur daily or off and on, and can be mild or intense. As the disease gets worse and more of the pancreas is destroyed, pain may actually become less severe. During an attack, the pain often is made worse by drinking alcohol or eating a large meal high in fats.\nBecause a damaged pancreas can't produce important digestive enzymes, people with chronic pancreatitis may develop problems with digesting and absorbing food and nutrients. This can lead to weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, diarrhea, and greasy, foul-smelling stools. Over time, a damaged pancreas can also fail to produce enough insulin, which results in diabetes.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will diagnose acute pancreatitis based on\nThere is no single test that can be used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis. If you have long-lasting abdominal pain or signs that your food is not being properly absorbed, such as weight loss or greasy stools, your doctor will ask you about alcohol use and other factors that increase your risk of chronic pancreatitis and other digestive problems.\nThe diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis can be made based upon\n",
      "Expected duration": "Mild to moderate acute pancreatitis often goes away on its own within one week. But severe cases can last several weeks.\nIf significant damage is done to the pancreas in a single severe attack or several repeat attacks, chronic pancreatitis can develop.\nOnce the cells of the pancreas have been destroyed, they do not regenerate easily. For this reason, diabetes and any other problems associated with chronic pancreatitis require long-term treatment.\nSome people with chronic pancreatitis also develop chronic pain. It is unclear why this happens, but once chronic pain develops, it tends to be long-lasting or even lifelong. Many patients require long-term medications for pain.\n",
      "Prevention": "Since most cases of pancreatitis are associated with alcohol use, the best way to prevent the problem is to avoid or limit alcohol use. Anyone who has had an episode of alcohol-related acute pancreatitis should stop drinking entirely to lower the possibility of developing chronic pancreatitis. People who have been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis can prevent further damage by eliminating alcohol use.\nMost first episodes of acute pancreatitis that are not related to alcohol use cannot be prevented. However, taking steps to prevent gallstones may help to prevent gallstone-related acute pancreatitis. To help prevent gallstones, maintain a normal weight and avoid rapid weight loss.\nIf the cause is gallstones, gallbladder surgery will usually be recommended to prevent future attacks.\n",
      "Treatment": "Most people who develop acute pancreatitis are admitted to the hospital. They are treated with pain relievers and intravenous fluids.\nYou will not be allowed to eat or drink until your symptoms begin to improve. In most cases, nothing can be done to speed healing or shorten an episode. If the episode is prolonged, and a patient cannot eat for longer than a week, nutrition may be given intravenously.\nBecause chronic pancreatitis cannot be cured, treatment is directed toward relieving pain, improving food absorption, and treating diabetes if it has developed. Pain management can be very challenging and require the help of a pain specialist.\nProblems absorbing food, and the resulting vitamin deficiencies, can be helped by taking supplemental digestive enzymes in pill or capsule form. Your doctor also may recommend seeing a dietician or nutritionist to help design an eating plan. Once digestive problems are treated, people often gain weight and their diarrhea improves.\nDiabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis almost always requires treatment with insulin.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor or proceed to urgent care if you have intense abdominal pain that lasts longer than 30 minutes, or persistent vomiting.\nMake an appointment with your doctor if you have\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, acute pancreatitis goes away on its own after a couple of days. People with severe pancreatitis may need to remain in the hospital for a week or longer. A small percentage of patients develop complications, such as an infected pancreas or bleeding inside the abdomen.\nPancreatitis caused by heavy drinking is likely to come back if drinking continues. Over time, permanent damage may be done to the pancreas.\nAlthough chronic pancreatitis is an incurable condition, the severity, frequency, and type of symptoms can vary. Some people — especially those who quit drinking alcohol entirely — have very mild or occasional symptoms that are easily managed with medications. Other people — especially those who continue to drink alcohol — can have disabling, daily pain and may require frequent hospitalizations.\n",

      "What is it?": "Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder. A person with panic disorder has panic attacks. These are repeated, unexpected episodes of intense fear and anxiety accompanied by physical symptoms that are similar to the body's normal response to danger.\nIf you are truly in danger (for example, if you are confronted by a criminal with a gun), your body readies itself for \"fight or flight.\" Heart rate increases. Blood rushes to arm and leg muscles, causing a trembling or tingling sensation. You may sweat and become flushed. You become intensely fearful, aroused and very alert. For people having a panic attack, these changes occur even though there is no physical threat. At the height of a panic attack, there may be a frightening feeling that the environment has somehow become unreal or detached. The person may worry about dying, having a heart attack, losing control or \"going crazy.\"\nSome people with panic disorder have several panic attacks every day, while others go weeks or months between attacks. Since panic attacks occur without warning even during sleep people who suffer from panic disorder are usually anxious that an attack may begin at any moment. They worry not only about the psychological pain and physical discomfort of the panic attack, but also that their extreme behavior during a panic episode might embarrass them or frighten others. This unshakable fear and anticipation eventually may lead to avoiding public places where it would be difficult or embarrassing to make a sudden exit.\nThis fear is called agoraphobia. People who have agoraphobia may, for example, avoid attending a performance in a crowded stadium or movie theater; waiting in line at a store; traveling on a bus, train or plane; or driving on roads that have bridges or tunnels. If this symptom is pronounced enough, a doctor may assign \"agoraphobia\" as an additional diagnosis.\nAlthough researchers do not completely understand why some people develop panic disorder, they believe that the illness involves a disturbance in brain pathways that regulate emotion. Also, it is possible that people with panic disorder may have inherited a \"fight or flight\" response that is either more sensitive than normal or responds more intensely than usual.\nStudies of close relatives of people with panic disorder show that this disease has a genetic (inherited) basis. These relatives are four to eight times more likely to develop the illness than people with no family history of the problem. Women are two times more likely than men to have panic disorder, and about three times more likely to develop agoraphobia. On average, symptoms start at around age 25, but panic disorder and agoraphobia can affect people of all ages.\nSome people with panic disorder first develop symptoms after a stressful life event, such as divorce, job loss or a death in the family. Scientists still do not understand exactly how panic attacks are triggered, but there is growing evidence that stress early in life makes a person more likely to develop panic symptoms.\nPeople who have panic disorder have a relatively high risk for developing other types of psychiatric problems. In fact, at the time of diagnosis, more than 90% of people with panic disorder also have major depression, another anxiety disorder, a personality disorder or some form of substance abuse.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A panic attack is defined by having at least four of the following symptoms:\nBetween panic attacks, someone with panic disorder usually has persistent worries that a new attack will occur. These worries may cause the person to dramatically change his or her behavior or lifestyle to avoid the embarrassment of \"losing control\" while with other people.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If you develop panic disorder, you may consult a primary care doctor first because the physical symptoms often make the person feel like they're having a heart attack, a stroke or a breathing problem. Many medical illnesses can cause symptoms that mimic panic attacks, including heart disease, asthma, cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy, hormone abnormalities, infections and disturbances in levels of certain blood chemicals.\nSymptoms of a panic attack can also be triggered by the use of amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, hallucinogens, alcohol and other drugs, as well as by certain prescription medications.\nA doctor may do tests to rule out medical problems, but the results of these tests will usually be normal. The doctor may then ask you questions about your family history; psychiatric history; current anxieties; recent stresses; and daily use of prescription and nonprescription drugs, including caffeine and alcohol. If your doctor suspects that the problem is panic disorder, he or she will refer you to a mental health professional for care.\nA mental health professional will do a full evaluation that includes:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Panic disorder can be long-lasting, especially if it is not treated. Fortunately, it is a very treatable illness. With proper care, many people find long-term relief from their symptoms.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent panic disorder. However, if you have been diagnosed with panic disorder, you may be able to prevent panic attacks by cutting down on caffeine, alcohol or other substances that might be triggering your symptoms. Once a diagnosis is made, treatment often eliminates panic attacks or makes them less intense.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have panic attacks, there are several treatment options both medications and psychotherapy.\nAntidepressants– Despite their name, many of these drugs are very effective for anxiety. They are used very commonly to treat generalized anxiety disorder. The popular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft) and escitalopram (Lexapro) are often the first choice. Antidepressants that have a different mechanism of action work too. Examples are mirtazapine (Remeron), venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta). Older antidepressants are also effective, but may have more troublesome side effects. They include tricyclic antidepressants (for example, nortriptyline, imipramine) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs, for example, phenelzine).\nSince antidepressants often take several weeks to work, your doctor may also prescribe a fast-acting benzodiazepine for relief.\nBenzodiazepines– These drugs affect a chemical messenger that works in the brain's fear response system. The first two benzodiazepines — chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium) — were discovered in the early 1960s. Common, newer benzodiazepines are clonazepam (Klonopin) and lorazepam (Ativan). They are reasonably safe when taken as directed and often bring quick relief from symptoms of anxiety. Since they act immediately, they may be prescribed during the first weeks of treatment while waiting for an antidepressant medication to take hold.\nAnother reason these drugs are prescribed for a relatively short time is that the body sometimes becomes accustomed to the effect. That is, benzodiazepines may provide less relief as time goes on. If you need to stop taking these drugs, do so gradually under a doctor's direction, because withdrawal reactions can occur.\nThe FDA requires all benzodiazepines to carry the strongest warning regarding the risks of dependency, addiction, or withdrawal symptoms. The FDA also emphasized the importance of not combining a benzodiazepine drug with an opioid because it can stop a person's breathing.\nCognitive therapy– This nondrug therapy is designed to help a person with panic attacks recognize the unreasonableness of the fears that cause panic. The therapist will often teach specialized techniques to help manage the attacks.\nBehavior therapies– These treatments include in vivo exposure, a form of behavior therapy that gradually exposes the person to fear-provoking situations;respiratory training, a technique that focuses on breath control as a way of fighting panic; andapplied relaxation, a method that teaches the patient to control his or her anxiety level by using muscle control and imagination. For many patients, the most effective approach is a combination of one or more medications, plus some form of cognitive or behavior therapy.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "If you have symptoms of a panic attack, and you have never been diagnosed with panic disorder, seek medical help immediately. Remember, symptoms of a panic attack can mimic those of many life-threatening medical illnesses. For this reason, a doctor should evaluate your problem comprehensively.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With appropriate treatment, the prognosis is good. Between 30% and 40% of patients become symptom-free for extended periods, while another 50% continue to experience only mild symptoms that do not significantly affect daily life.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disease of the central nervous system. It causes problems with body motions, including:\nTremor (shakiness)\nRigidity (muscle stiffness)\nSlowed body movements\nUnstable posture\nDifficulty walking\nPD develops when certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain die. These are neurons that produce a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine helps relay messages between areas of the brain that control body movement.\nWhen these neurons die, abnormally low levels of dopamine are produced. This makes it difficult to control muscle tension and muscle movement.\nHaving a parent or sibling diagnosed with the disease at a younger age increases your risk of getting PD. The same is not true if the affected family member was older when diagnosed.PD usually occurs in middle age. It typically begins around age 60. A small number of patients have early onset PD. They are younger than 40 years old when symptoms begin.\n",
      "Symptoms": "PD usually begins as a slight tremor or stiffness. It occurs in the arm or leg on one side of the body. The tremor is most obvious at rest. It is regular, typically occurring three to six times per second.\nThe PD tremor:\nUsually worsens under stress\nImproves when the arm or leg is moved voluntarily\nMay disappear entirely during sleep\nAt first, PD may be evident only as a tremor involving the thumb and index finger. It looks as if the person is manipulating a small object.\nAs the illness worsens, tremors may become more widespread. They eventually affect limbs on both sides of the body. Handwriting may become small, shaky and eventually illegible.\nPD often causes stiffness or rigidity in the arms or legs. In addition, there is a slowing of body movements, called bradykinesia.\nRigidity and bradykinesia can be the most disabling aspects of the disease. They can impair the person's ability to walk. They can make it difficult to perform daily activities. These may include washing, dressing or using utensils.\nProblems with unsteady balance and posture may make it hard to sit down in a chair, or to rise from one. Walking is accomplished with small, shuffling steps and a stooped posture.\nBradykinesia can affect the facial muscles. It can decrease spontaneous facial expressions and normal eye blinking.\nOther symptoms of PD may include:\nDepression\nAnxiety\nDisturbed sleep\nMemory loss\nSlurred or abnormally soft speech\nDifficulty chewing or swallowing\nConstipation\nImpaired bladder control\nAbnormal regulation of body temperature\nSexual dysfunction\nCramps, numbness, tingling or pain in the muscles\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will examine you. He or she will pay extra attention to the neurological examination.\nYour doctor will look for symptoms of PD, especially:\nThe classic PD tremor\nSlowness of movement\nRigidity\nGait problems\nThere is no specific diagnostic procedure or laboratory test to establish a Parkinson's diagnosis. Doctors diagnose the disease based on the symptoms and physical and neurological exams.\nIf a patient's symptoms improve after taking PD medication, the diagnosis is probably correct.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "PD is a chronic, often progressive illness.\n",
      "Prevention": "Doctors are not sure what causes PD. There is no known way to prevent it.\n",
      "Treatment": "There is no cure for PD. But its symptoms can be treated with several different types of medication.\nWhen symptoms are not overly troublesome, medication may not be necessary. Early treatment may even increase the chance of developing side effects and other complications later.\nTreatment usually is started when:\nSymptoms interfere with:\nWork\nManagement of household affairs\nOther activities\nDifficulty with walking and balance becomes significant\nMedicationsMedications used to treat PD either:\nBoost the levels of dopamine in the brain\nor\nMimic the effects of dopamine\nThe most commonly used medication for PD is levodopa. Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the brain.\nLevodopa usually is prescribed in combination with another drug called carbidopa. The second drug increases the amount of active drug that reaches the brain. It also limits side effects. The two drugs, levodopa and carbidopa, are combined in one pill (Sinemet).\nNearly all patients with PD improve after they start taking levodopa. However, long-term use eventually causes side effects and complications. Doctors often need to adjust the frequency and dose of levodopa so the person can continue taking it.\nSeveral medications can be used either alone or in combination with levodopa to treat symptoms.\nFor mild symptoms in early PD, amantadine (Symmetrel) helps release stored dopamine in the brain.\nAnticholinergic medications also help relieve mild symptoms in early PD. There are several choices, including trihexyphenidyl (Artane, Trihexane, Trihexy), benztropine (Cogentin), biperiden(Akineton), or procyclidine(Kemadrin). Anticholinergic drugs are particularly effective against tremor. But they can cause side effects. These include confusion and hallucinations, especially in elderly patients.\nAnother treatment option for early PD is a monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor, such as selegiline (Carbex, Eldepryl) or rasagiline (Azilect). MAO-B inhibitors boost the effectiveness of the dopamine that the brain is still making. They may delay the need for stronger drugs. Eventually, though, people taking an MAO-B inhibitor will need a levodopa-containing drug.\nDopamine agonists mimic the effects of dopamine. Some of the commonly used dopamine agonists are pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip) and transdermal rotigotine (Neupro)—may be used to delay the need for levodopa. Older patients can be especially sensitive to these drugs. They can cause confusion, hallucinations and weakness due to low blood pressure. Also some people develop impulse control disorder, such as a new gambling problem.\nDrugs called COMT inhibitors also can be used in combination with levodopa. COMT inhibitors, such as entacapone (Comtan) and tolcapone (Tasmar), prolong the action of dopamine in the brain. They also increase the effectiveness of levodopa. When a COMT inhibitor is added, the doctor usually lowers the levodopa dose.\nDepression is a fairly common problem among people with PD. Many patients can benefit from treatment with antidepressant medications.\nRegular exercise and a balanced diet also may help to improve a patient's overall sense of well-being and body control.\nSurgerySurgery is considered when patients stop responding well enough to medications. Surgical options include:\nDeep brain stimulation. The electrodes are placed after brain mapping.\nPrecise destruction of targeted areas in the brain. Destroyed areas are responsible for the most troubling symptoms.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Call your doctor if you develop any of the symptoms of PD.\nAlso call if you:\nNotice a persistent tremor or stiffness anywhere in your body\nHave trouble walking\nHave trouble rising from a chair\nHave any symptoms of depression\n",
      "Prognosis": "There is no cure for PD. But a well-constructed treatment plan allows many patients to lead active lives.\n",

      "What is it?": "A paronychia is an infection of the skin that surrounds a toenail or fingernail. There are two different types of paronychia, acute and chronic:\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "An acute paronychia causes throbbing pain, redness, warmth and swelling in the skin around a nail. In some cases, a small collection of pus forms under the skin next to the nail, or underneath the nail itself. Often, only one nail is affected.\nA chronic paronychia usually causes less dramatic symptoms than an acute paronychia. Typically, the area around the nail is tender, red and mildly swollen; the cuticle is missing; and the skin around the nail feels moist or \"boggy.\" Several nails on the same hand may be affected at the same time.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If you have a mild acute paronychia, you usually can make the diagnosis yourself. Look for throbbing pain, swelling and redness in an area of damaged skin around a nail.\nIf you are diabetic, have several affected fingers or toes, or have severe symptoms (pus, fever, severe pain), you must be evaluated by a doctor. In most cases, your doctor can make the diagnosis by examining the affected area. However, if there is an accumulation of pus, the doctor may take a sample of the pus to be tested in the laboratory for bacteria or fungi.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long a paronychia lasts depends on the type of paronychia. With proper treatment, an acute paronychia usually heals within 5 to 10 days. A chronic paronychia may require several weeks of antifungal medication. Even after proper medical therapy, a paronychia may return if you injure the skin again or forget to keep the nail area dry.\n",
      "Prevention": "To prevent paronychia, try the following:\n",
      "Treatment": "The type of treatment depends on the type of paronychia:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have symptoms of a paronychia and:\n",
      "Prognosis": "With proper treatment, the outlook is usually very good. In most cases, an acute paronychia heals within 5 to 10 days with no permanent damage to the nail. Rarely, very severe cases may progress to osteomyelitis (a bone infection) of the finger or toe.\nAlthough a chronic paronychia may take several weeks to heal, the skin and nail usually will return to normal eventually. However, you must remember to apply medication as directed, and to keep the affected area dry.\n",

      "What is pelvic inflammatory disease?": "Pelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. It most often affects sexually active women during their reproductive years.\nPelvic inflammatory disease is the most common preventable cause of infertility in the United States. The infection can cause tissue inside the fallopian tubes to become scarred, which can damage the fallopian tubes or block them completely and cause difficulty becoming pregnant. This can also increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The more often a woman gets this infection, the greater her risk of complications. In addition, even one episode of PID can lead to persistent pelvic pain.\nPelvic inflammatory disease is a major reason for hospitalization in young women. Most cases develop from sexually transmitted infections. The two types of bacteria most likely to be associated with pelvic inflammatory disease are gonorrhea and chlamydia. Gonorrhea and chlamydia cause damage to the protective mucous barrier that the cervix usually provides, allowing additional harmful bacteria to find their way into the uterus and beyond.\nPelvic inflammatory disease typically develops in a two-stage process. First, the organisms infect the cervix (opening of the uterus). Then, in about 10% of women, bacteria migrate up to the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. Sometimes pelvic inflammatory disease can develop if bacteria get into the upper portions of the reproductive tract after childbirth. Less commonly, the condition can develop after inserting an intrauterine device (IUD) or after a dilation and curettage of the uterus. While these procedures carry some risk of infection, especially if the patient also has a sexually transmitted infection at the same time, infections can be prevented by taking antibiotics at the time of the procedure.\nPelvic inflammatory disease is most common in women younger than age 25 who have more than one sex partner. Women who have had a sexually transmitted infection have a higher risk of getting pelvic inflammatory disease, as do those who have had a pelvic infection in the past. Any woman whose sex partner has more than one sex partner is also at increased risk of pelvic infection.\n",
      "Symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease": "Symptoms can be severe, minor or nonexistent. The most common symptoms include:\n",
      "Diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease": "Your doctor will ask you to detail your symptoms and when they started. Knowing the sexual habits of both you and your partner or partners and what methods you use for birth control and prevention of sexual transmitted infections will help her to make a plan for treatment. Your doctor will perform a pelvic examination, during which she can gently move your cervix to see if it causes an increase in pain and also feel for tender areas in your pelvic region.\nThe diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease is not always easy because the site of infection cannot be examined easily. Also, the symptoms sometimes mimic symptoms of other conditions, such as appendicitis.\nDuring the pelvic examination, your doctor may take a sample of fluid from the inside of your cervix with a sterile, cotton-tipped swab, or may ask you to provide a urine sample. A laboratory will test the sample for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Your doctor may order a blood test to see if your white blood cell count is high, which may indicate that the pelvic inflammatory disease is more severe.\nYour doctor will likely order a pelvic ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan to provide details of the location of the infection and to see if an abscess has formed.\n",
      "Expected duration of pelvic inflammatory disease": "Most cases of pelvic inflammatory disease clear up after 10 to 14 days of antibiotic treatment. More severe cases may need to be treated in a hospital.\n",
      "Preventing pelvic inflammatory disease": "Other than avoiding unprotected sexual intercourse, there is no guaranteed way to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease. However, women who are in monogamous sexual relationships have very little risk if neither person was infected with an STD from a previous partner. Condoms provide protection against STDs. Although oral contraceptives can prevent pregnancy, women with more than one sex partner also should make sure their partners use condoms every time they have vaginal intercourse.\nBecause most cases of pelvic inflammatory disease are linked to sexually transmitted infections, treating a woman's sex partners is essential to prevent repeat infections. All recent sex partners of a woman with pelvic inflammatory disease should be treated as if they had both gonorrhea and chlamydia. A woman with pelvic inflammatory disease should not have sex again until her sex partners have been treated.\n",
      "Treating pelvic inflammatory disease": "The primary treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease is antibiotics, and in most cases, antibiotics alone can cure the infection. Because pelvic inflammatory disease often is caused by more than one type of organism, two or more antibiotics may be necessary. Antibiotics can be taken by mouth or intravenously (through a vein). If you use oral antibiotics, it is important to finish all of the medication, even if the symptoms go away. This is because the infection can still be present after the symptoms disappear. In most cases, antibiotics must be taken for 10 to 14 days.\nIf you are being treated for pelvic inflammatory disease, your doctor may ask you to call two to three days after beginning treatment to report your progress. If your condition is not improving, you will need to visit your doctor again to have another examination.\nSome women with a severe infection need to be hospitalized to receive antibiotics intravenously. If fever and pain do not improve after several days, you may need a pelvic ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan to see if an abscess has formed. If you have an abscess, you may need surgery or a minor procedure to place a drain in the abscess, in addition to antibiotics to cure the infection.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience any symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease, see your doctor promptly.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Getting prompt treatment and follow-up care can cure pelvic inflammatory disease and keep it from causing further problems. Follow your doctor's advice closely, finish all your medication and return to your doctor for all scheduled checkups. To avoid reinfection, your sex partner(s) also should be treated, and you should follow all of the recommendations for prevention.\n",

      "What is it?": "The eardrum is a thin membrane that separates your ear canal (the part that is open to the outside) from your middle ear. The eardrum, also called the tympanic membrane, is involved in hearing. Sound waves cause your eardrum to vibrate. This begins the process of converting the sound waves into an impulse that travels to your brain, where it is recognized as sound.\nThe eardrum is delicate and can be torn (perforated) easily, most often by an infection of the middle ear (otitis media) but also by other types of trauma, including:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a perforated eardrum include:\nThe level of hearing loss depends on the size of the perforation and what caused it. Trauma to the ear or head can injure the middle ear, inner ear or both, and can cause severe hearing loss. If an explosion has torn the eardrum, you may have ringing in your ears (tinnitus) for several days, as well as hearing loss. If the perforated eardrum becomes infected, the hearing loss may worsen.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will look into your ear using an instrument called an otoscope to see if the eardrum is torn. He or she also will test your hearing. If the doctor suspects you have a ruptured eardrum but cannot see the perforation easily, he or she may confirm the diagnosis by blowing pressurized air into your ear using a special machine.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Most perforated eardrums heal in a few weeks. Some take up to two months. Exposure to water or further trauma can slow the healing. Also, if the ear gets infected during the healing phase, the perforation is less likely to close on its own. Larger tears, or tears that do not heal on their own, may require surgery.\n",
      "Prevention": "There are several steps you can take to prevent a perforated eardrum:\n",
      "Treatment": "If the hole is small, your doctor may allow it to heal on its own, and may have you take antibiotics to prevent infection while the eardrum heals. Keep water out of the injured ear, and avoid blowing your nose, which can cause pressure changes in the ear and disrupt healing.\nSome holes may be patched in the office of an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat doctor). A thin paper patch is placed over your eardrum in combination with a chemical that encourages the eardrum to heal.\nIf your eardrum has not healed after two months, your doctor may recommend a surgery called tympanoplasty, which involves using tissue from another area to patch the eardrum. This is usually an outpatient procedure and has a high success rate.\nWhile your ear is healing from the surgery, keep your ear dry by using cotton balls covered with Vaseline to protect your eardrum from water during showers or baths. Also, avoid blowing your nose, which can damage the healing tissue. Warm compresses, such as a warm, damp washcloth, or a heating pad can relieve some discomfort. Your doctor also may prescribe pain-relieving medication or recommend that you use over-the-counter pain medications.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Any time you have hearing loss, you should contact your doctor. If you are being treated for a perforated eardrum and have symptoms for more than two months, see your doctor for a follow-up evaluation. See your doctor sooner if you develop drainage from the ear.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is excellent. Most perforated eardrums heal within two months without complications. Hearing loss is usually temporary, though some people experience some level of permanent hearing loss. Occasionally, a chronic (long-lasting) infection may cause the perforation to become permanent along with some degree of hearing loss.\n",

      "What is it?": "Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the saclike membrane that surrounds the heart. Pericarditis can be triggered by a number of different medical conditions. Often the exact cause cannot be identified. Doctors call this idiopathic pericarditis.\nIn many people with pericarditis, the initial trigger is a viral infection. However, the inflammation may not be a direct result of the infection. Instead, the virus may stimulate the immune system to attack and inflame the pericardium.\nOther medical conditions associated with pericarditis include:\nOther rare causes of pericarditis include radiation therapy to treat cancers in the chest, cancer in the chest area, a fungal infection or a parasitic infection.\nPericarditis can be:\nThe inflammation of pericarditis usually causes fluid to weep into the pericardial sac. This is known as a pericardial effusion. If the pericardial effusion is large enough, it can interfere with the heart's ability to fill normally and to pump blood, a condition called cardiac tamponade.\nSometimes, pericarditis leads to scarring of the lining around the heart. The inflamed pericardium thicken can thicken and contract around the heart, interfering with heart function. This condition is called constrictive pericarditis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The classic symptoms of acute pericarditis are chest pain and fever. This chest pain can be either brief and sharp or steady and constricting. It is usually under the breastbone, but it also can spread to the neck or shoulders. In many patients, chest pain becomes more severe if they take a deep breath, swallow, cough, or lie down. Sitting up or leaning forward may relieve the pain.\nPatients with cardiac tamponade can have low blood pressure and shortness of breath. Patients with constrictive pericarditis also can have breathing difficulties, together with edema (swelling) of the ankles, legs and abdomen.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will review your medical history. He or she will specifically want to know if you have:\nYour doctor also will ask you to describe your chest pain, including its location, what triggers it (cough, swallowing, deep breath), how long it lasts and what relieves it. He or she will ask about other symptoms especially fever, joint aches and any new rash.\nThe nurse or medical assistant will take temperature, and measure your heart rate and blood pressure. The doctor's exam will focus on the heart. Your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for a characteristic grating, leathery sound that can appear in patients with pericarditis. This sound is called a pericardial friction rub.\nIf your doctor is concerned that the chest pain is related to a heart attack, he or she will likely call an ambulance to take you to the hospital.\nTests commonly used to help diagnose pericarditis include:\nIf a pericardial effusion has developed, a sample of the fluid may be removed (aspirated) from around your heart with a sterile needle and examined in a laboratory. Also, depending on the suspected cause of the pericarditis, you may need a skin or blood test for tuberculosis or additional blood testing to look for signs of infection, heart attack, or autoimmune disease.\n",
      "Expected duration": "The symptoms of acute pericarditis usually improve within a few days of starting treatment. Acute pericarditis most often resolves completely without damage to the heart or the pericardium.\nPericarditis in people with autoimmune disease is more likely to recur and/or persist.\n",
      "Prevention": "Because pericarditis can be the result of so many very different illnesses, there are no routine guidelines to prevent the condition. You can help prevent pericarditis caused by infections by practicing good hygiene, especially washing your hands often, and by keeping up with recommended immunizations.\nTo prevent pericarditis caused by heart attack, you can reduce your risk of coronary artery disease by not smoking, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, lowering LDL cholesterol and controlling blood pressure.\nTo reduce your risk of trauma-related pericarditis, you should wear a seat belt whenever you drive and wear appropriate chest-protecting equipment when you play contact sports.\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of acute pericarditis depends on the cause. You will be told to rest and to take aspirin or an anti-inflammatory drug.\nFor viral and idiopathic acute pericarditis, doctors often prescribe a combination of colchicine and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve, generic versions) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, generic versions). The NSAID dose is usually higher than the dose indicated on the over-the-counter preparations.\nYour doctor may decide to treat with you a corticosteroid, such as prednisone, especially if you have a known autoimmune disease.\nPatients with tuberculous pericarditis will need anti-tuberculosis medication.\nThose with a bacterial infection will need strong antibiotics and removal of any infected fluid around the heart.\nPatients with uremic pericarditis caused by kidney failure will need hemodialysis, a mechanical procedure to clean the blood.\nIf you have cardiac tamponade, excess fluid around your heart will be withdrawn with a sterile needle in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.\nWhen constrictive pericarditis interferes with heart function, the thickened pericardium may be removed surgically in a procedure called a pericardiectomy.\nFor patients with idiopathic or recurrent pericarditis, daily colchicine can reduce the frequency and severity of future attacks.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Always seek medical attention for new and unexplained chest pain.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people with acute pericarditis recover within 2 to 4 weeks. Recurrence of acute pericarditis occurs in about 20 percent of the people who have unexplained pericarditis.\nPericarditis in people with autoimmune disease may come and go, depending on course of the underlying medical illness.\n",

      "What is it?": "In peripheral arterial disease (previously called peripheral vascular disease), not enough blood flows to the legs. The condition usually is caused by fatty deposits called plaques that build up along the walls of blood vessels. This buildup shrinks the size of the passageway and reduces the amount of blood that can flow through. This is a condition called atherosclerosis.\n\nThe risk factors for getting peripheral arterial disease are similar to the risk factors for coronary heart disease, and include:\n",
      "Symptoms": "The most common symptom of peripheral arterial disease is intermittent claudication – pain or cramping in the legs or buttocks that starts when you exercise and goes away when you rest. Often the pain is described as a deep ache, especially in the calf muscle. The pain may extend to the foot or up toward the thigh and buttock. Sometimes, there is just numbness in the leg or a sense that one leg gets tired when you walk. A foot or toes also may feel cold or numb.\nIf the arteries are severely narrowed, you could experience leg pain at rest, when you are not exercising. If blood flow stops completely (usually because a blood clot forms in the narrowed vessel), parts of the leg may become pale or turn blue, feel stone cold to the touch and eventually develop gangrene.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will review your personal risk factors for atherosclerosis and your family history. Your doctor will ask if you or any family members have heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure or any other circulation disorder. During the physical examination, your doctor will feel the pulse in your upper leg (near the groin), on the inside of your ankle, the top of your foot and the back of your knee. Any weakness in a pulse may be a sign of narrowed arteries.\nUsually the doctor can diagnose peripheral arterial disease based on your symptoms, risk factors, the examination of your legs and the strength of your pulses. Your doctor may measure the blood pressure in your legs and compare it to the blood pressure in your arm to calculate the ankle-brachial index, or ABI. The ratio the blood pressure measured at your ankle is compared to the blood pressure measured at your elbow. Normally blood pressure is the same or a little higher in the legs so the ratio is 1.0 or higher.\nA ratio of less than 0.95 in either leg indicates narrowing of the arteries in that leg. People who have symptoms of peripheral arterial disease usually have a ratio of 0.8 or less.\nYour doctor may order ultrasound of the legs to measure blood flow. The test is non-invasive and painless, using sound waves to create the pictures. If your doctor suspects that you need a procedure to help open a blocked blood vessel, you may need a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your arteries or an angiogram, which is an X-ray test that uses dye in the narrowed arteries to reveal the pattern of blood flow and spot blockages.\n\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once you have peripheral arterial disease, your arteries usually will remain narrowed. However, even though your arteries are narrowed, your symptoms can decrease and even go away with treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent peripheral arterial disease by modifying your risk factors:\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment for peripheral arterial disease includes:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you consistently suffer from cramps, aching, numbness or disproportionate fatigue in your leg muscles or buttocks when you exercise. Call immediately if you have these symptoms at rest or when any part of your leg or foot suddenly turns numb, cold, pale or a bluish color.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most people with peripheral arterial disease, leg symptoms remain stable. About 10% to 15% of patients improve, and about 15% to 20% get worse. The outlook is better for people who are able to remain tobacco-free, stay on a healthy diet, keep their blood cholesterol under control and exercise regularly.\n",

      "What Is It?": "The peritonsillar space lies between each tonsil and the wall of the throat. An infection can cause a pus-filled swelling (abscess) to develop in this space. Peritonsillar abscesses, also called quinsy, usually occur as a complication of tonsillitis. They most often are caused by \"strep throat\" bacteria (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci).\nIf a peritonsillar abscess is not treated promptly, the infection can spread to the neck, roof of the mouth and lungs. The swelling can push the tonsil closest to it into the center of your throat and move the uvula (the flap of tissue hanging in the back of your throat) from the center toward the unaffected side of your throat. In severe cases, the swelling can make breathing difficult or can close your airway.\nPeritonsillar abscesses most often are found in older children, adolescents and young adults. They are less common than in the past because tonsillitis now often is treated with antibiotics, which destroy the infection-causing bacteria.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will examine your throat, mouth and neck, and swab your throat. Material on the swab is sent to the laboratory for a culture, which can identify the type of bacteria causing the infection. Your doctor may want to look at your throat by using a small telescope on flexible lighted tube, called an endoscope.  He or she may also order an x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan to better see the extent of infection in the soft tissues of the neck.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "After treatment, symptoms should disappear within five to seven days.\n",
      "Prevention": "Tonsillitis should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible to help prevent a peritonsillar abscess from developing.\n",
      "Treatment": "Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. In severe infections, these antibiotics may be given intravenously (into a vein).\nMany abscesses will not respond to antibiotics alone, and will need to be drained. This can be done with a needle or by making a small incision and suctioning out the fluid. This often is done in a doctor's office or emergency room, but occasionally may need to be done in an operating room, especially if the infection has extended down into your neck. Your doctor will provide adequate sedation and pain medication to make you comfortable during this procedure. Because the symptoms make it difficult to eat or drink, some people may need intravenous fluids (injected into a vein) to treat or prevent dehydration.\nIf tonsillitis or a peritonsillar abscess keeps coming back, you may need to have your tonsils removed surgically in a procedure called a tonsillectomy.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Call your doctor if:\nIf you have been treated for a peritonsillar abscess, but you still have symptoms after two to three days, visit your doctor again.\n",
      "Prognosis": "After treatment, the outlook is usually excellent. Peritonsillar abscess can come back, however. Possible complications of a severe abscess include pneumonia, fluid around the lungs or heart, airway obstruction and skin infection of the neck or jaw.\n",

      "What is it?": "Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious bacterial infection that causes violent coughing. The coughing makes it hard to breathe and produces a deep \"whooping\" sound.\nPertussis is caused by the Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis bacteria. Droplets of the bacteria move through the air when an infected person sneezes, coughs or talks. This is how pertussis spreads from person to person.\nPertussis can occur at any age. Serious illness is most common in infants and young children. Older children, adolescents and adults usually have milder symptoms.\nThe number of pertussis cases in the United States has increased in recent years.\n",
      "Symptoms": "On average, symptoms begin about 7 to 10 days after the pertussis bacteria enter your body. Initial symptoms usually resemble the common cold. Other symptoms may include:\nInfants under 6 months of age, adolescents and adults may have a cough that lasts many weeks without the characteristic whooping sound. If you have a cough that lasts more than a week without improvement, contact your doctor.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine you. However, the examination is often not remarkable. Most people with pertussis don't have fever by the time they see the doctor.\nYour doctor will suspect the diagnosis based on:\nIf your doctor thinks you have pertussis, a swab from your nose or throat can confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "Prevention": "A vaccine is available for both children and adults. Children up to age 7 years old receive an immunization called DTaP, which includes pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. Babies under 6 weeks old cannot receive DTaP.\nDoctors recommend 5 total doses of the DTaP vaccine for all infants and children, unless there is a medical reason to withhold vaccination. Children are usually immunized at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months and 4 to 6 years.\nVaccines are also available for older children and adults. These age groups receive a pertussis vaccine called Tdap. This should be given at age 11 or 12 and every 10 years thereafter.\nIf you live with or have close contact with someone who has pertussis, contact your doctor to ask whether you should take an antibiotic.\nIf you have whooping cough, avoid contact with infants, young children and pregnant women.\nAll pregnant women should be vaccinated against pertussis. Even if you have been vaccinated within the prior couple years before pregnancy, your doctor may recommend you receive it again to protect your newborn. Also be sure everyone in your household is up-to-date with Tdap vaccine.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have whooping cough, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics. Antibiotics are most effective in the early stages of the infection. You will no longer be contagious after about five days of antibiotics. However, your cough may continue for weeks even if you have taken antibiotics.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you or your child has a prolonged cough or develops other symptoms of pertussis.\nCall 911 or go to an emergency room if you or your child has any of the following symptoms:\n",
      "Prognosis": "In older children and adults, the outlook is generally very good. It may take a few months for the cough to entirely clear up. Infants need careful monitoring to avoid complications.\n",

      "What are phimosis and paraphimosis?": "In an uncircumcised male, the head of the penis is covered by a sheath of skin known as the foreskin. Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin is tightly stretched around the head of the penis and cannot be pulled back freely. Phimosis can occur naturally. For example, in boys younger than age 4, it is normally hard to pull back the foreskin. However, in older boys and men, phimosis is often related to an infection under the foreskin (balanitis) and appears to be more common in men with diabetes.\nParaphimosis occurs when a tight foreskin is pulled back behind the head of the penis and then becomes stuck. It cannot be placed forward again to its usual position covering the tip of the penis. This can cause swelling, pain, and loss of blood flow to the tip of the penis. If the foreskin cannot be pushed back into its natural position, serious harm can occur.\n",
      "Symptoms of phimosis and paraphimosis": "Phimosis is usually painless. However, a very tight foreskin may interfere with urination or sexual function. In addition, phimosis may make it difficult for a man to clean under the foreskin, which can make infection of the skin more likely.\nParaphimosis usually results in painful swelling of the foreskin and head of the penis. Severe loss of blood flow to the head of the penis may be signaled by a deep purple color, which usually indicates a medical emergency.\n",
      "Diagnosing phimosis and paraphimosis": "A doctor can diagnose phimosis and paraphimosis during a physical examination.\n",
      "Expected duration of phimosis and paraphimosis": "Phimosis in a young child is likely to improve on its own. In adults, phimosis will not go away unless surgery is performed or an infection is treated.\n",
      "Preventing phimosis and paraphimosis": "Phimosis may be prevented by good hygiene. This includes fully pulling back the foreskin, so you can clean under it during bathing.\nParaphimosis can be prevented by carefully replacing the foreskin every time it is pulled back. If paraphimosis occurs, circumcision may be recommended to prevent it from happening again.\n",
      "Treating phimosis and paraphimosis": "Phimosis without any symptoms does not require treatment. This is especially true in children. If a boy does not outgrow phimosis or there are problems with urination or hygiene, treatment with certain medicated creams, such as hydrocortisone, may be effective.\nIn some older boys and men with phimosis, good hygiene and prompt treatment of infections may be all that is needed to prevent problems. In other men, persistent symptoms occur, and corrective surgery (circumcision) needs to be performed.\nIt is an emergency if paraphimosis occurs and the foreskin cannot be pushed back into its normal position. A physician may need to do an emergency procedure to create a slit in the foreskin, or perform circumcision.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you:\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most men, phimosis is not a serious problem and will not require treatment. However, it is not expected to improve on its own.\nAs noted above, paraphimosis is sometimes a medical emergency, and the penis may become permanently damaged if you do not seek immediate medical attention.\n",

      "What is phobia?": "A phobia is a persistent, excessive, unrealistic fear of an object, person, animal, activity, or situation. It is a type of anxiety disorder. A person with a phobia either tries to avoid the thing that triggers the fear, or endures it with great anxiety and distress.\nSome phobias are very specific and limited. For example, a person may fear only spiders (arachnophobia) or cats (ailurophobia). In this case, the person lives relatively free of anxiety by avoiding the thing he or she fears. Some phobias cause trouble in a wider variety of places or situations. For example, symptoms of acrophobia (fear of heights) can be triggered by looking out the window of an office building or by driving over a high bridge. The fear of confined spaces (claustrophobia) can be triggered by riding in an elevator or by using a small restroom. People with these phobias may need to alter their lives drastically. In extreme cases, the phobia may dictate the person's employment, job location, driving route, recreational and social activities, or home environment.\nThe most common types of phobias include:\nChildhood phobias occur most commonly between the ages of 5 and 9, and tend to last a short while. Most longer-lasting phobias begin later in life, especially in people in their 20s. Adult phobias tend to last for many years, and they are less likely to go away on their own, unless they are treated. Phobia can increase an adult's risk of other types of psychiatric illness, especially other anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse.\n\n",
      "Symptoms of phobia": "The symptoms of phobia are:\n",
      "Diagnosing phobia": "A mental health professional is likely to ask about current symptoms and family history, particularly whether other family members have had phobias. You may want to report any experience or trauma that may have set off the phobia – for example, a dog attack leading to a fear of dogs.\nIt may be helpful to discuss how you react – your thoughts, feelings, and physical symptoms – when you are confronted with the thing you fear. Also, describe what you do to avoid fearful situations, and how the phobia affects your daily life, including your job and your personal relationships.\nYour doctor will ask about depression and substance use because many people with phobias have these problems as well.\n",
      "Expected duration of phobia": "In children, specific phobias can be short-term problems that disappear within a few months. In adults, about 80% of new phobias become chronic (long-term) conditions that do not go away without proper treatment.\n",
      "Preventing phobia": "There is no way to prevent a phobia from starting. However, treatment can reduce the negative impact of the disorder.\n",
      "Treating phobia": "Treatment usually includes some combination of psychotherapy and medication depending on the type of phobia:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible if you are troubled by fears or anxieties that are disturbing your peace of mind, interfering with your personal relationships, or preventing you from functioning normally at home, school, or work.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is very good for people with specific phobia or social phobia. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 75% of people with specific phobias overcome their fears through cognitive-behavioral therapy, while 80% of those with social phobia find relief from medication, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or a combination.\nWhen agoraphobia occurs with panic disorder, the prognosis is also good. With appropriate treatment, 30% to 40% of patients become free of symptoms for extended periods, while another 50% continue to experience only mild symptoms that do not significantly affect daily life.\n",

      "What is conjunctivitis?": "Conjunctivitis, also called pink eye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the transparent membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the whites of the eyes. Conjunctivitis can be triggered by allergies, by contact with irritating chemicals, or by infections with either a virus or bacteria.\nImage: dtimiraos/Getty Images\n",
      "Symptoms of conjunctivitis": "Symptoms of conjunctivitis include:\nIf it's viral conjunctivitis, this eye discharge tends to be thin, clear and watery. The eye discharge from bacterial conjunctivitis it is often thick, discolored (yellow or greenish), cloudy and sticky. Sometimes, the discharge is so sticky that the eyelids stick to one another. This is most likely to happen after waking up from sleep. With allergic conjunctivitis, both eyes usually are involved, itching is more intense and the eyes may swell.\nIf you wear contact lenses, you are more likely to develop severe conjunctivitis, which can damage the eye. Stop wearing contact lenses if you develop a red eye. Contact your primary care doctor or an eye doctor immediately if you have any pain.\n",
      "Diagnosing conjunctivitis": "Your doctor will suspect conjunctivitis if you have an itchy, red eye with a discharge or increased tearing. If your doctor suspects bacterial conjunctivitis, he or she may take a sample of your eye discharge and send it to a laboratory to be tested.\n",
      "Expected duration of conjunctivitis": "Even without treatment, most cases of viral conjunctivitis will go away within seven days.\nBacterial conjunctivitis requires antibiotics. Eye redness usually begins to clear up within a couple of days after you start taking antibiotics. Make sure you take all your antibiotics, even if you start to feel better. Otherwise the medicine may not kill all the bacteria.\n",
      "Preventing conjunctivitis": "It is possible to prevent infectious conjunctivitis. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes. At home, never share towels, washcloths or facial cosmetics with others, especially eye makeup.\nTo prevent conjunctivitis in newborn babies, all pregnant women should be tested and, if necessary, treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia infections. As another preventive measure, newborns routinely are treated at birth with antibiotic eye drops.\n",
      "Treating conjunctivitis": "For uncomplicated viral conjunctivitis, your doctor may suggest nonprescription eye drops, which relieve eye symptoms while your body fights off the viral infection.\nFor bacterial conjunctivitis, you'll need prescription ointment or eye drops containing antibiotics. Use these for as many days as your doctor tells you, even if your symptoms clear up within a day or two. You also can apply warm compresses, such a washcloth, to your eyes for 20- to 30-minute periods, several times a day. Gently wipe away eye discharge and dry, crusty material with a clean, moist cotton ball or tissue.\nFor allergic conjunctivitis, antihistamine eye drops and cool compresses can help to relieve itching.\nNewborns that develop gonorrheal or chlamydial conjunctivitis are treated with antibiotics that can be put on the eye, taken by mouth or injected into a vein, depending on the severity. Their mothers should be examined and treated for gonorrhea or chlamydia infections.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if your eyes become red, watery and itchy, especially if there is a thick eye discharge that crusts on your eyelids. Call your doctor immediately if you have pain or swelling in your eyes, or if you develop blurred vision or a high fever or become sensitive to light. Call your doctor immediately whenever an infant, especially a newborn, shows symptoms of conjunctivitis.\nIf you are taking antibiotics to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, call your doctor if your eye redness continues after three days.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most cases of uncomplicated viral or bacterial conjunctivitis get better without causing permanent eye damage.\n",

It is protected by a cradle of bone called the sella turcica, which is located above the nasal passages, almost directly behind the eyes. The pituitary gland sometimes is called the master gland because it produces hormones that regulate many bodily functions, including the production of:\n\nWhen tumors develop in the pituitary gland, they are usually small, localized, slow-growing masses that start in one type of hormone-producing pituitary cells. Although these tumors almost always are benign (noncancerous), they have the potential to cause significant symptoms by:\nA pituitary tumor is classified as one of four main types, based on whether it overproduces pituitary hormones and the specific type of hormone produced:\nIn the United States, pituitary tumors are diagnosed in 1 to 15 of every 200,000 people each year, most commonly in women between the ages of 15 and 44. However, autopsy studies suggest that a much larger percentage of the population — perhaps as high as 11% — may have very tiny pituitary tumors that never cause symptoms.\n",
      "Symptoms of pituitary tumors": "A pituitary tumor causes symptoms based on:\n",
      "ACTH-producing tumor": "This tumor causes symptoms of Cushing's disease, a condition caused by prolonged overproduction of adrenal glucocorticoids and androgens. Symptoms of Cushing's disease include obesity that is most noticeable on the trunk of the body, thin skin, easy bruising, red or purple lines (striae) on the skin of the abdomen, a moon-shaped face, muscle wasting, excess body hair in women, acne, absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) and psychiatric symptoms, such as depression and psychosis. Cushing's disease also can trigger osteoporosis, high blood pressure (hypertension), and diabetes.\n",
      "Prolactin-producing tumor": "This tumor occasionally causes a woman who is not pregnant or nursing to produce breast milk, a condition called galactorrhea. Much more often, it causes absent periods (amenorrhea). In men, it causes impotence and decreased sex drive.\n",
      "Growth hormone-producing tumor": "If this tumor develops before puberty, then the child typically has the following symptoms of giantism (also called gigantism): abnormally rapid growth, unusually tall stature, a very large head, coarse facial features, very large hands and feet, and sometimes, behavioral and visual problems. If the tumor develops after puberty, then the person has the following symptoms of acromegaly: thick, oily skin; coarse features with thick lips and a broad nose; prominent cheekbones; a protruding forehead and lower jaw; a deep voice; enlargement of the hands and feet; a barrel-shaped chest; excessive sweating; and pain and stiffness in the joints.\n",
      "Nonfunctioning pituitary tumor": "These tumors do not produce excessive amounts of hormone. They may be found:\nProlactin-producing tumors and nonfunctioning tumors can depress the pituitary's ability to make and release other hormones. Sex hormones usually are depressed first followed by thyroid hormone and then adrenal hormones. Symptoms related to low sex hormone levels include loss of sexual drive, erectile dysfunction, and absence of menstrual periods. If a tumor keeps growing, the person may develop fatigue and lightheadedness because the thyroid and adrenal glands aren't functioning properly.\nA very large pituitary tumor that grows beyond the sella turcica can cause headaches, loss of peripheral vision and partial paralysis of the eye muscles.\n",
      "Diagnosing pituitary tumors": "Your doctor will review your symptoms, medical history and current medications. This information is very important because certain medical conditions and/or prescription drugs can have significant effects on your levels of body hormones. For example, psychiatric drugs called neuroleptics can increase blood levels of prolactin, and prescription glucocorticoids (even therapeutic injections of dexamethasone — Decadron and other brand names — into injured joints) can cause high blood levels of glucocorticoids.\nDuring a physical examination, your doctor will look for the signs that show your body is overproducing a particular pituitary hormone. For example, your doctor may look for breast milk production caused by a prolactin-producing tumor or a moon-shaped face and abdominal marks caused by an ACTH-producing tumor.\nIf your doctor suspects that you have a pituitary tumor, the first step usually is a blood test for hormone levels. Your doctor probably will order an MRI scan of your head to obtain detailed images of the pituitary gland. Usually this test involves an injection of a dye called gadolinium, which is used to highlight brain structures.\nIf you are having any visual symptoms or the MRI shows a large pituitary tumor, your doctor will refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for a comprehensive eye exam, including special eye tests that detect visual loss in specific visual fields.\n",
      "Expected duration of pituitary tumors": "In most cases, a pituitary tumor will continue to slowly grow until it is treated. Sometimes, however, a prolactin-secreting tumor will stabilize, or even improve, without treatment.\n",
      "Preventing pituitary tumors": "Because doctors do not know why pituitary tumors develop, there is no way to prevent them.\n",
      "Treating pituitary tumors": "Doctors have two main goals in treating pituitary tumors: to reduce the abnormally high levels of hormones and to shrink the tumor to prevent pressure damage to the optic nerves and brain. Treatment depends on the type of pituitary tumor:\nTranssphenoidal hypophysectomy is a safe and effective procedure that is popular for cosmetic reasons. However, not all pituitary tumors can be removed by using this surgical approach, either because the tumor is too large or because it is in a position that is difficult to reach through the nose. Instead, the surgeon must do a procedure called a craniotomy, which removes the tumor through an incision in the front portion of the skull.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment to see your doctor if:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the type of pituitary tumor, the size of tumor at the time of diagnosis and the extent of injury to the optic nerves and other parts of the body:\n",

      "What is it?": "Pityriasis rosea is a harmless skin disease that causes scaly patches that sometimes itch over the torso, neck, arms and legs. Anyone can get it, but it is most common in people ages 10 to 35.\nTypically, the disease begins with the appearance of a single large, pink, scaly, oval patch, called the \"herald patch.\" This patch is approximately 1 inch to 2 inches long. It tends to have a salmon-colored center surrounded by a darker pink ring, which some people mistake as a sign of ringworm.\n\nWithin about two weeks, many smaller patches appear, sometimes hundreds of them. They appear mainly on the abdomen and back. On the back, the patches tend to line up along the ribs, giving the rash a distinct \"Christmas tree\" pattern. The rash goes away on its own, usually within two months. Any skin discoloration from the rash will fade after another few months.\nThe exact cause of pityriasis rosea is unknown. There is some evidence to suggest it is caused by a reactivation of human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7). It seems to occur most often in spring and autumn. It is not thought to be contagious, and it does not lead to any other disorder.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptoms of pityriasis rosea are the appearance of the herald patch followed by a more diffuse rash of smaller patches. The patches tend to be oval, scaly, and dry to the touch. They may be pink, red or brown and generally appear on the abdomen, back, neck, arms and legs. Only rarely do the patches appear on the face.\nUsually there are no other symptoms. However, some people experience itching that can be intense.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "In most cases, a physician or dermatologist can diagnose pityriasis rosea simply by looking at it. Although there is no specific blood test to diagnose pityriasis, blood testing may be ordered to exclude other diagnoses. If there is any question of a skin fungus, a scraping of the edge of a spot will be placed on a slide and examined under the microscope. Rarely, a skin biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of tissue is removed and sent to a laboratory to be examined.\n",
      "Expected duration": "After the initial rash, or herald patch, appears, the secondary rash of smaller patches appears within about 2 to 14 days. This more widespread rash generally lasts 3 to 8 weeks but may linger for months.\n",
      "Prevention": "Because no one knows what causes pityriasis rosea, there is no way to prevent it. It does not appear to be contagious.\n",
      "Treatment": "Itching, if present, can be treated in several ways. An over-the-counter a lotion that cools the skin (such as one with camphor or menthol) or corticosteroid cream (such as Cortizone-10 or Cortaid) may be enough to provide relief. For more severe itching, your doctor may advise an oral antihistamine or prescribe a stronger corticosteroid cream.\nIn very severe cases, or if the rash lasts longer than usual or the rash covers a large part of the body, ultraviolet (UV) light therapy may be recommended. Doses of UV-B rays, similar to the sun's rays, are given by exposing the skin to the light rays for short periods of time over several days. The skin may turn slightly red, similar to a mild sunburn.\nAlso, there is some evidence that oral acyclovir might shorten the duration of the rash.\nThe red spots may appear more prominently after a hot shower or bath and after heavy physical activity. The condition doesn't get worse. The rash simply becomes more noticeable.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See a health care professional if you or your child develops an unexplained rash. Although treatment is not necessary for pityriasis rosea, its symptoms are similar to other skin diseases, such as ringworm, that need to be treated. Your physician can diagnose the problem and recommend appropriate treatment.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is excellent. Most cases clear up within two months. The rash rarely returns. Although some people, especially those with dark skin, experience some skin discoloration from the rash spots, it usually fades with time. Generally, there are no lasting effects.\n",

      "What is it?": "Plantar fasciitis is a painful inflammation of the plantar fascia, a fibrous band of tissue on the bottom of the foot that helps to support the arch. Plantar fasciitis occurs when this band of tissue is overloaded or overstretched. This causes small tears in the fibers of the fascia, especially where the fascia meets the heel bone.\nPlantar fasciitis is common in obese people and in pregnant women, perhaps because their extra body weight overloads the delicate plantar fascia. It is also more common in people with diabetes, although the exact reason for this is unknown.\nPlantar fasciitis also can be triggered by physical activities that overstretch the fascia, including sports (volleyball, running, tennis), other exercises (step aerobics, stair climbing), or household exertion (pushing furniture or a large appliance). In athletes, plantar fasciitis may follow intense training, especially in runners who push themselves too quickly to run longer distances.\nWorn or poorly constructed shoes can contribute to the problem if they do not provide enough arch support, heel cushion, or sole flexibility.\nDespite what is known about risk factors and triggers of plantar fasciitis, many people who develop this condition have no identifiable risk factors or trigger.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of plantar fasciitis can occur suddenly or gradually. When they occur suddenly, there is usually intense heel pain on taking the first morning steps, known as first-step pain. This heel pain will often subside as you begin to walk around, but it may return in the late afternoon or evening. When symptoms occur gradually, a more long-lasting form of heel pain will cause you to shorten your stride while running or walking. You also may shift your weight toward the front of the foot, away from the heel.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A health care professional will ask you whether you have the classic symptoms of first-step pain and about your activities, including whether you recently have intensified your training or changed your exercise pattern.\nYour doctor often can diagnose plantar fasciitis based on your history and symptoms, together with a physical examination. If the diagnosis is in doubt, your doctor may order a foot X-ray, bone scan, or nerve conduction studies to rule out another condition, such as a stress fracture or nerve problem.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once an appropriate treatment program begins, it may take six to eight weeks before the pain begins to be relieved. Total pain relief may not happen for several months.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent plantar fasciitis by maintaining a healthy weight, by warming up before participating in sports, and by wearing shoes that support the arch and cushion the heel. In people who are prone to episodes of plantar fasciitis, exercises that stretch the heel cord (known as the Achilles tendon) and the plantar fascia may help to prevent plantar fasciitis from returning. Ice massage also can be used on the bottom of the foot after stressful athletic activities. It is possible that strict control of blood sugar will prevent plantar fasciitis in people with diabetes, although this has not been proven.\n",
      "Treatment": "Most doctors recommend an initial six-to-eight-week program of conservative treatment, including:\nIf this conservative treatment does not help, your doctor may recommend that you wear a night splint for six to eight weeks. While you sleep, the night splint will keep your foot in a neutral or slightly flexed (bent) position to help maintain the normal stretch of the plantar fascia and heel cord.\nIf the night splint doesn't work, your doctor may inject corticosteroid medication into the painful area, or place your foot in a short leg cast for one to three months.\nA number of unproven therapies have sometimes been recommended to treat plantar fasciitis. These include shock wave therapy, radiation therapy, botulinum toxin injections, laser therapy, and whole blood or platelet-rich plasma injections. Their benefit is uncertain and they are not considered standard or routine treatment options.\nIf all else fails, your doctor may suggest surgery. But this is rare, and surgery is not always successful.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have significant foot or heel pain, especially if this pain makes it difficult for you to walk normally.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is excellent for most people with plantar fasciitis. At least 90% of patients respond either to the first six to eight weeks of conservative therapy, or to conservative therapy followed by six to eight weeks of wearing night splints.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Pleurisy means inflammation of the pleura, the membrane that lines the lungs within the chest cavity. Depending on its cause, pleurisy can be associated with an accumulation of fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall (called a pleural effusion) or it can be dry pleurisy, which has no fluid accumulation.\nPleurisy can develop many ways, including:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Pleurisy typically causes a sharp chest pain (pleuritic chest pain) that worsens with breathing in or coughing. The pain may start and remain in one specific area of the chest wall, or it may spread to the shoulder or back. To ease chest pain from pleurisy, a person with pleurisy often lies on the affected side as a way of limiting movement of the chest wall. In rare cases, the chest pain of pleurisy is a fairly constant, dull ache.\nDepending on the specific cause of pleurisy, other symptoms may be present. For example, a person with pneumonia may have a high fever, shortness of breath and a cough that produces thick, yellow or dark sputum (mucus). A pulmonary embolus may be associated with shortness of breath, a low-grade fever and a cough that brings up small amounts of blood. A person with lung cancer may have unexplained weight loss and cough.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history, including your history of smoking. He or she also may ask whether you have been anywhere where you may have been exposed to tuberculosis.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, he or she will examine you, paying special attention to your lungs. Your doctor will check for signs of pleural effusion by gently tapping your chest wall. He or she also will listen with a stethoscope to check for a pleural friction rub, the rough, scratchy sound of the inflamed layers of pleura sliding past each other during breathing. Depending on the results of your physical examination and the suspected cause of your pleurisy, the doctor then may recommend:\nDepending on the results of these preliminary tests, additional tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. For example, in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, a lung scan or CT scan of the lungs may be used to confirm the diagnosis. A patient with confirmed pleural effusion may require a procedure called thoracentesis, in which some chest fluid is removed and sent to a laboratory to be tested.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "How long pleurisy lasts depends on its cause. For example, pleurisy caused by pleurodynia may come and go over a few days. In rare cases, a person with pleurodynia may have several episodes of pleuritic chest pain over several weeks before the illness finally goes away. In patients with bacterial pneumonia or rheumatic fever, pleurisy typically goes away when the infection is cured with antibiotics. In patients with lung cancer or connective tissue disease, the chest pain of pleurisy may persist for longer periods.\n",
      "Prevention": "In some cases, you can prevent pleurisy by preventing the medical condition that causes it. For example, some types of pneumonia can be prevented by vaccination. The risk of lung cancer is reduced by not smoking.\nNot all cases of pleurisy can be prevented.\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of pleurisy depends on its underlying cause:\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Call your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room if you experience any form of severe or persistent chest pain or any difficulty breathing. Chest pain can be a symptom of many different disorders, some of which are potentially life threatening.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In patients with pleurisy, the outlook depends on the underlying medical illness.\n",

      "What is it?": "Pneumoconiosis is a lung condition that is caused by inhaling particles of mineral dust, usually while working in a high-risk, mineral-related industry. At first, irritating mineral dust can trigger lung inflammation, which causes areas of the lung to be temporarily damaged. Over time, these areas can progress to form tough, fibrous tissue deposits. This stage of pneumoconiosis is called fibrosis. Fibrosis stiffens the lungs and interferes with the lung's normal exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\nThere are several different types of pneumoconiosis. In the United States, the most common types include:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Pneumoconiosis sometimes does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms develop, they can include:\nIf pneumoconiosis causes severe lung fibrosis, breathing can become extremely difficult. When this happens, the patient's lips and fingernails may have a bluish tinge. In very advanced disease, there also may be signs of leg swelling caused by too much strain on the heart.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your exposure to mineral dusts, the number of years you were exposed, and whether you used protective clothing and equipment. Your doctor will examine you, paying special attention to your chest. This will be followed by a chest X-ray, which will be compared to a set of standard X-rays published by the International Labor Office for the evaluation of pneumoconiosis. Your doctor may order breathing tests, called pulmonary function tests. In some patients, a more detailed computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is necessary. Less often, a doctor will order a test called a bronchoscopy with a lung biopsy. In this test, a flexible tube is inserted into a lung and a small piece of lung tissue is removed to be examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Pneumoconiosis causes permanent lung changes. However, you can stop it from getting worse.\n",
      "Prevention": "Pneumoconiosis almost always can be prevented. To reduce your risk, you can:\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have pneumoconiosis and you develop breathing problems, your doctor will advise you to avoid further exposure to the mineral dust. He or she may prescribe one or two medicines that are inhaled to decrease inflammation in your airways and to help keep your bronchial tubes open. If the oxygen level in your blood is below 90%, you may need to breathe additional oxygen at home. Also, to help protect your damaged lungs against respiratory infections, your doctor will recommend immunization with the influenza (flu) and pneumococcal vaccines. If you develop a respiratory infection, you may need to be treated with antibiotics.\nWhen pneumoconiosis causes extreme breathing problems, a lung transplant is the only cure.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly if you have symptoms of pneumoconiosis and you have worked at a job where there is a high risk of exposure to mineral dust.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for this disease depends on the specific type of pneumoconiosis, the length of exposure to mineral dust, the level of exposure and whether the patient is a smoker.\nIn the long term, people with asbestosis and talc pneumoconiosis have an increased risk of lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma (cancer of the membranes lining the lungs and abdominal cavity). The risk of lung cancer is especially high in smokers with asbestosis.\nBecause male workers fill most of the jobs that carry high risks of pneumoconiosis, the majority of deaths from pneumoconiosis occur in men.\n",

Therefore your doctor will need to treat it with antibiotics.\nThere are multiple antibiotics that treat pneumonia. The initial choice of drug(s) is made based on the category of pneumonia you most likely have. The two major categories are community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and health care associated pneumonia (HCAP).\nCommunity acquired pneumonia refers to pneumonia in a person that has not recently stayed in the hospital or a nursing home. The most common bacterial cause of CAP isStreptococcus pneumoniae.\nHealth care associated pneumonia refers to pneumonia that develops in a person that is in the hospital now or has recently been in the hospital or a nursing home. These pneumonias tend to be more serious. The organisms found in a hospital often become resistant to many antibiotics. Also hospitalized patients are often weakened by other illnesses and are less able to fight off the infection.\nA type of pneumonia called aspiration pneumonia develops when chemical irritants and bacteria from the mouth or stomach are inhaled into the lungs. It is more common in people who have had strokes or a neurological condition that results in difficulty controlling their swallowing reflexes. People who are unconscious as a result of alcohol or other drug overdose are also at high risk of aspiration pneumonia.\nIn people with compromised immune systems, the organisms that cause pneumonia are different than those seen in the other types of pneumonia.\n",
      "Symptoms of pneumonia": "Most types of pneumonia cause fever, cough with sputum (coughed-up mucus), shortness of breath and fatigue. In older patients, fatigue or confusion can be the only or most noticeable symptom. In viral pneumonia, a dry cough without sputum is more common.\n",
      "Diagnosing pneumonia": "Your doctor first will ask about your symptoms. During the physical exam, your doctor will check to see if you are breathing rapidly. He or she also will look for confusion and a purplish hue in your lips, fingernails or hands because these symptoms can indicate that you have low levels of oxygen in your blood. Using a stethoscope, a health care professional can listen through your back for abnormal sounds from the lungs. The diagnosis of pneumonia most often is confirmed by a chest X-ray.\n\nYour doctor may order blood tests to look for an elevation of infection-fighting white blood cells and to make sure your electrolytes and kidney function are normal. A sample of your sputum or blood may be sent to a laboratory to help identify the specific cause of your pneumonia. Identifying the infectious organism can help your doctor to choose the best antibiotic to treat the infection. Even though most of the time no single germ is identified, the pneumonia still can be treated successfully with antibiotics.\n",
      "Expected duration of pneumonia": "How long pneumonia lasts can vary from a few days to a week or longer, depending on how early you start antibiotics and what other medical problems you may have. Antibiotic treatment for pneumonia usually lasts from 5 to 14 days. Many people find that it takes a few weeks to several weeks to regain the level of energy they had before the pneumonia.\n",
      "Preventing pneumonia": "Vaccination against the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia calledS. pneumoniaehelps protect adults age 65 and older and those younger people at increased risk of pneumonia from developing this infection. High risk people includes those with:\nChildren younger than age 5 should receive the full vaccination series. Although it is used mostly to reduce the risk of meningitis and ear infections in children, it also lowers the risk of pneumonia.\nEveryone should stay current with their age appropriate vaccination schedule to prevent other infections, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19.\n",
      "Treating pneumonia": "The main treatment for pneumonia is one or more antibiotics. A younger or healthier person can be treated safely with antibiotics at home and can feel better in a few days. Some people are at higher risk of complications and may need to be hospitalized. They include people who are older than 60 or have other diseases such as heart failure, active cancer, chronic kidney disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nIn addition to antibiotics, other treatments for pneumonia include rest, adequate fluid, and supplemental oxygen if needed to maintain a safe blood oxygen level.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "A simple cold or bronchitis caused by a virus can share many of the same symptoms as pneumonia. Pneumonia is possible when your cough produces sputum with a green or brown color, you are having shaking chills and/or high fever, or you are having trouble breathing. In these cases, you should promptly call your doctor.\nAlso, if you have been diagnosed with a cold or bronchitis and symptoms are getting worse or persist after a week, you should call your doctor's office for another evaluation.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most pneumonia is treated successfully, especially if antibiotics are started early. Pneumonia can be fatal. The very old and frail, especially those with many other medical conditions, are most vulnerable.\nPneumonia usually does not cause permanent damage to the lungs. Rarely, pneumonia causes infected fluid to collect around the outside of the lung, called an empyema. The empyema may need to be drained with a special tube or surgery. With aspiration pneumonia, the affected lung may develop a lung abscess that needs many weeks of antibiotic therapy.\n",

      "What is it?": "A pneumothorax is commonly known as a collapsed lung. Normally, the outer surface of the lung sits next to the inner surface of the chest wall. The lung and the chest wall are covered by thin membranes called pleura.\nA collapsed lung occurs when air escapes from the lungs or leaks through the chest wall and enters the space between the two membranes (pleural cavity). As air builds up, it causes the nearby lung to collapse.\nA collapsed lung may be caused by an injury to the lungs or chest wall, such as:\nOccasionally, a lung will collapse without any direct injury to the lung or chest. This is called a spontaneous pneumothorax. This is more likely to happen in people with lung disease.\nIt is particularly common in emphysema, which causes air-filled sacs, called blebs, to form. When one of these sacs bursts, air is released into the pleural cavity, causing the lung to collapse. It also occurs in people with asthma, cystic fibrosis and pneumonia.\nA spontaneous pneumothorax also can develop in people who don't have any obvious lung disease. It's most common in tall, thin men between the ages of 20 and 40 and smokers.\nIn most cases of pneumothorax, some air can move in and out through the tear in the lung or chest wall. If air can only move into the chest cavity, but not out, pressure builds up inside the pocket of trapped air. This is called a tension pneumothorax.\nA tension pneumothorax can cause complete collapse of the nearby lung and can push the heart and major blood vessels to the other side of the chest. This is a life-threatening emergency. Tension pneumothorax most commonly occurs in people with penetrating chest injuries.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a collapsed lung include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may suspect you have a collapsed lung if you suddenly develop shortness of breath or chest pain, especially if you have had trauma to the chest. He or she will ask about your symptoms, your medical history and your smoking habits.\nYour doctor will examine you, focusing on your general appearance, your vital signs (temperature, pulse, breath rate, blood pressure), and your lungs. The following signs can indicate that you have a collapsed lung:\nA chest X-ray is the best way to confirm that you have a collapsed lung. The X-ray will show the collapsed lung as a dark area in the chest. A computed tomography (CT) scan may be needed to find a small collapsed area of a lung or for people with extensive lung disease.\nYour doctor may check the oxygen level in your blood with a handheld device called a pulse oximeter or may draw blood from an artery in the wrist (an arterial blood gas test) to directly measure the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. He or she also may order an electrocardiogram (EKG), an electrical test of the heart.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once the cause of a collapsed lung is treated, it usually will return to normal within 48 to 72 hours. Recovering from a collapsed lung may take up to several weeks.\n",
      "Prevention": "Most cases of collapsed lung cannot be prevented. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of developing the types of lung disease associated with this problem. Wearing your seat belt in the car and avoiding other activities that put you at risk of chest injuries can help you to avoid a collapsed lung caused by trauma.\n",
      "Treatment": "A collapsed lung can be treated in several different ways. Your doctor will choose the right treatment based on several factors, including the size and location of the collapsed lung and your medical condition.\nTreatment options include:\nIf you need to be admitted to the hospital for treatment, you will likely receive oxygen by nasal prongs or a mask for the first couple days.\nYou may be treated or observed for several days to make sure the collapsed lung re-expands. If you have had a serious chest injury or treatment does not expand your lung, your doctor will discuss the possibility of surgery to repair the lung and pleura. Sometimes damaged or scarred portions of lung are removed to allow the collapsed lung to heal. Traditional surgery requires the chest to be opened. But techniques using tiny cameras (thoracoscopy) are used more today because they result in less scarring and faster recovery times.\nPeople with who keep developing a collapsed lung may need treatment to prevent it from happening again. Options include:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have symptoms of a collapsed lung, especially if you have lung disease or have had a collapsed lung before. Even if your symptoms seem to improve, call your doctor. Some people with a collapsed lung notice that chest pain and shortness of breath improve in the first 24 hours, but the lung is still collapsed.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Once a collapsed lung has re-expanded and healed, there is usually no long-term effect on your health. However, up to 50% of people have a lung collapse again, especially within a few months of the first one. To decrease the risk of a second collapsed lung again:\n",

      "What is it?": "Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare, but potentially life threatening, inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis) that damages the walls of the body's small- and medium-sized arteries. This damage slows the supply of blood and nourishment to the arteries, causing nearby tissue in many parts of the body to be injured or even destroyed.\nThe disease most commonly affects the kidneys, the nerves of the arms and legs and the abdominal organs, although it can also involve the skin, joints, muscles, brain, heart, eyes and reproductive organs.\nIn individual organs, polyarteritis nodosa can have the following effects:\nIt is difficult to know exactly how many people have this illness because its symptoms can be confused with other diseases and other forms of vasculitis. One British study found that polyarteritis nodosa occurs in three or four of every 1 million people each year in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it may occur more often. According to one Minnesota study, it occurred in up to nine in every 1 million people.\nPolyarteritis nodosa can affect people of all races and age groups, but most commonly strikes adults between the ages of 40 and 50. Men are affected about twice as often as women.\nAlthough the cause of polyarteritis nodosa is unknown, some research has linked it to the presence of microscopic clumps of antibodies from the body's defense system, coupled with foreign proteins, such as portions of a virus. In some people with polyarteritis nodosa, the illness seems to be triggered by a viral liver infection, either hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\nIn some patients, researchers have found at least one autoantibody (an immune protein that attacks the body rather than a foreign invader) that appears to be related to the arterial damage of polyarteritis nodosa. This autoantibody, called antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, also has been found in the blood of patients with other vasculitic disorders, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, most patients with polyarteritis nodosa do not have this antibody in their blood or tissues, and many experts do not believe this antibody plays an important role in this condition.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In most people, polyarteritis nodosa develops gradually over weeks to months. The first symptoms include fever, weight loss, weakness, a generally sick feeling (called malaise), muscle aches, headaches or abdominal pain. These complaints are called nonspecific, because many illnesses and diseases produce the same symptoms. Eventually, these symptoms are followed by specific signs of arterial damage to one or more organs. Depending on the location and severity of the damage, any of the following symptoms can occur:\nBecause polyarteritis nodosa can cause such a wide variety of symptoms, no two people experience it in exactly the same way.  And it can be difficult to diagnose quickly.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will review your medical history and medications you take. If your doctor suspects that you have polyarteritis nodosa, he or she will ask whether you have been immunized against hepatitis B. Your doctor may ask if you live a lifestyle that increases your risk of hepatitis infection, such as whether you share needles for drug injections or have unprotected sex.\nAfter checking your body temperature and blood pressure, your doctor will examine you. Depending on your symptoms, the doctor will pay special attention to your skin, abdomen and heart, and to any neurological symptoms or signs. After the exam, your doctor may send you for tests to look for evidence of arterial inflammation and organ damage, especially in your kidneys. These tests may include:\nOther blood tests may be performed to check for other explanations for your condition.\nTo confirm that you have polyarteritis nodosa, your doctor may recommend that a sample (a biopsy) of the involved tissue be obtained so that it can be examined under a microscope to see if an artery is inflamed. For example, a skin biopsy may help to confirm the diagnosis.\nAs an alternative, your doctor may send you for an X-ray procedure called angiography, which can pinpoint aneurysms or other areas of arterial damage in the affected area. This is less accurate than a biopsy but in some cases, a biopsy may not be possible; for example, major arteries cannot be sampled without causing excessive bleeding or other complications. In such cases, an angiogram may be the best way to show evidence of vasculitis. Sometimes an angiogram using CT scan or MRI can show changes in blood vessels suggestive of vasculitis. Although a positive blood test for the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody may support the diagnosis in some patients, this test alone is usually not enough to confirm polyarteritis nodosa.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Some people respond promptly to therapy and can taper off treatment over many months. Others require long-term treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent most cases of polyarteritis nodosa.\nBeing vaccinated against hepatitis B, and avoiding activities that increase the risk of hepatitis, such as sharing needles during intravenous drug use or having unprotected sex, may prevent hepatitis-related polyarteritis nodosa.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have no evidence of hepatitis and your symptoms are relatively mild, the doctor usually will begin your treatment with a steroid drug, such as prednisone, a powerful medication that suppresses the immune system and reduces inflammation. However, if you have more severe symptoms involving your heart, nerves or kidneys, if you don't improve with initial treatment or if you have relapses after initial treatment, prednisone may be combined with an additional immunosuppressant medication, such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar) azathioprine (Imuran), methotrexate (Rheumatrex), mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) or rituximab (Rituxan). Full treatment usually takes at least one year.\nSometimes plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange) is recommended along with one or more medications (as noted above). Plasmapheresis is a process in which plasma is separated from the blood, cleaned of abnormal antibodies, and then replaced. The overall benefit of plasmapheresis for polyarteritis nodosa induced by viral hepatitis is not clear.\nIf polyarteritis nodosa is related to hepatitis B or hepatitis C, you may be treated with antiviral medications alone to fight the liver infection. Or antiviral treatment may be combined with prednisone to control arterial inflammation.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you develop any symptoms of polyarteritis nodosa. If you experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe abdominal pain or a combination of these symptoms, call or get to a hospital emergency room for an evaluation.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With proper treatment, at least 80% of people with polyarteritis nodosa survive for five years or more after diagnosis, often recovering completely. In one study, the risk of relapse after successful treatment was about 10%, although damaged blood vessels may cause problems, such as a heart attack, long after the inflammation has been treated. Without appropriate treatment, the prognosis is poor: only 10% of people survive for five years after they are diagnosed.\n",

      "What is polycystic kidney disease?": "Polycystic kidney disease causes numerous cysts (non-cancerous growths) to form in both kidneys. It is a genetic disease, meaning you inherit it from your parents. About 600,000 Americans have polycystic kidney disease.\nThe kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs that sit in the upper part of the abdomen. They filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood, which get passed out of the body in the form of urine. The kidneys also regulate the amount of certain vital substances in the body, such as electrolytes.\nWhen polycystic kidney disease causes numerous cysts to form in the kidneys, the kidneys get severely enlarged, and the cysts also take the place of normal kidney tissue. With less normal kidney tissue, the kidneys cannot function as well, and eventually the kidneys may fail. Cysts normally form in the kidneys as people age, but with polycystic kidney disease there are many more cysts than normal, and they cause problems in the body.\nIn about half of people with the most common type of polycystic kidney disease, the kidneys eventually fail. When that happens, the patient needs to get a kidney transplant or needs to go on regular dialysis, where a machine acts as the kidney and filters the blood. Usually a person can live with polycystic kidney disease for many years before the kidneys fail.\nThough its name makes it sound like it only affects the kidneys, polycystic kidney disease can also cause cysts in the liver and pancreas. It can also cause problems in other organs, such as aneurysms in the brain (bulges in the walls of blood vessels, which can leak and cause a stroke).\nThere are two major types of polycystic kidney disease:\n",
      "Symptoms": "",
      "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease": "The two most common symptoms are headaches and pain in the back and the sides, between the ribs and hips. The pain may be mild or severe; it may come and go or be persistent.\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can also cause\nMany people live with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease for several decades before symptoms develop. For this reason, you may hear the disease referred to as \"adult polycystic kidney disease.\"\n",
      "Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease": "Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease often causes symptoms in babies even before they are born. For this reason, it is often called \"infantile PKD.\" Children with this disease often experience:\nThe severity of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease varies. It can cause death in babies with the most severe forms, while other people live with it into adulthood without experiencing any symptoms.\n",
      "Diagnosing polycystic kidney disease": "Doctors use imaging studies to diagnose both types of polycystic kidney disease, usually ultrasound. Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce images of structures inside the body. On an ultrasound, a doctor can spot cysts on the kidneys that are one-half inch or bigger. Doctors can also use other imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI can measure the volume of cysts, and may help doctors track the progression of the disease.\nThrough blood tests, doctors can look for genetic mutations that are known to cause polycystic kidney disease. This test can diagnose the autosomal dominant version of the disease before large cysts develop, allowing someone with a mutation to do their best to preserve kidney function by eating well and keeping blood pressure under control. However, the test cannot predict when symptoms will start or how severe the disease will be. The test can be used by people with a family history of polycystic kidney disease to see if they will pass the gene on to their children.\n",
      "Expected duration of polycystic kidney disease": "Polycystic kidney disease is a life-long condition, but the severity of the disease varies a lot from person to person.\n",
      "Preventing polycystic kidney disease": "Since polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disease, there is nothing you can do to prevent it. Whether you get it is purely a matter of what genes you inherit from your parents.\n",
      "Treating polycystic kidney disease": "Since polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disease, there is nothing you can do to prevent it. Whether you get it is purely a matter of what genes you inherit from your parents.\n",
      "Pain": "Over-the-counter pain medications can help ease pain in the abdomen. Note, though, that it is important to talk to your doctor about which pain medications you should use — some over-the-counter and prescription pain medications can damage the kidneys. Surgery to shrink the cysts can also relieve pain.\nIf you have severe or recurring headaches, see your doctor before you try to treat them with over-the-counter medication. Headaches can be caused by high blood pressure, which would need to be treated in order to cure the headaches and prevent other health problems. A very severe headache might be caused by an aneurysm in the brain. An aneurysm is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.\n",
      "Urinary tract infections": "Antibiotics can treat urinary tract infections (UTIs),which occur frequently in people with polycystic kidney disease. If you have symptoms of a UTI, such as pain when you urinate or a frequent urge to urinate, see your doctor immediately. The infection needs to be treated quickly to prevent it from spreading from the urinary tract to the cysts in the kidneys, where infections are harder to treat.\n",
      "High blood pressure": "Keeping blood pressure under control is especially important for people with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease because it can slow the disease's effects on the kidneys. Eating a low-fat, low-salt diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products can help lower blood pressure. Also you should avoid tobacco products and exercise regularly.\nMedication is often needed for blood pressure control. The most effective treatment for people with this disorder is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). If blood pressure is still high, a diuretic and/or beta blocker can be added.\n",
      "Fluid intake": "There is some evidence that a very high total daily fluid intake, at least three liters per day, may slow progression of the condition. However, given that people are also restricting sodium intake, periodic blood tests to measure sodium concentration should be done to avoid a dangerously low level (hyponatremia).\n",
      "Tolvaptan": "Tolvaptan may be considered for some adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. This medication blocks can potentially help slow the formation of cysts and the progression of kidney damage.\n",
      "Kidney failure": "Polycystic kidney disease can eventually cause the kidneys to fail. When the kidneys stop working, either dialysis or kidney transplant is needed so that toxins continue to get filtered out of the blood. A person cannot live without this filtering activity.\nDialysis can be done in one of two ways, and it needs to be done regularly and continuously until a kidney transplant takes place.\nSurgery that transplants a healthy kidney into a person with polycystic kidney disease is the preferred treatment for kidney failure. After a transplant, cysts will not develop on the new, healthy kidney. However, receiving an organ transplant means that you need to take drugs to suppress the immune system for the rest of your life in order to prevent your body from rejecting the transplanted organ. These drugs make you more likely to get infections.\n",
      "Growth problems": "In children with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, eating increased amounts of nutritious food can improve growth. Growth hormone may also be used.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have pain in the abdomen, especially if it's accompanied by painful urinations or blood in the urine, see your doctor. If your baby has high blood pressure and pain or blood when urinating, tell your pediatrician. If you have polycystic kidney disease and experience a sudden severe headache, you need immediate medical evaluation to be sure this is not related to a brain aneurysm.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People with polycystic kidney disease can live for decades without it causing serious kidney problems. Keeping blood pressure under control by having a healthy lifestyle or taking medications can help ward off serious problems. However, especially with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, the disease's severity varies from person to person.\n",

      "What is it?": "Estrogen and progesterone are the female hormones produced by the ovaries. The levels of these hormones vary during the monthly menstrual cycle. They are essential to the development of follicles, which are fluid-filled pockets, containing an egg that is released each month.\nA third hormone, testosterone, also is produced by the ovaries in small amounts. Testosterone is in a broad class of hormones called androgens, and it is the dominant sex hormone in men. Between 4% and 7% of women produce too much testosterone in their ovaries. These women have a pattern of symptoms called polycystic ovary syndrome.\nWhen a woman has a high level of androgen hormones such as testosterone in her body, she can be unable to release eggs from their follicles in the ovaries. Since the fluid-filled follicles don't open and empty, they stay in the ovary and the ovaries appear to contain multiple small cysts. This is the reason for the term \"polycystic\" in the name of the disease. Women with this condition may have problems with fertility because egg release (ovulation) stops or happens only once in a while.\nIn addition to the problem of egg release during a monthly cycle, the woman's hormones don't change levels as they normally should. In reaction, the uterus manufactures a fragile inside lining that can cause her to have irregular bleeding. The lining is not shed all at once as during a normal menstrual period. Because of the abnormal hormone balance, the lining of the uterus is also at a higher risk of developing a cancer.\nIn women with polycystic ovary syndrome, the androgen hormones also cause cosmetic effects. Women with high levels of androgens can have acne and can have increased hair growth in a male pattern such as in the mustache area or on the face.\nCommonly, women with polycystic ovary syndrome not only have high levels of androgen hormones. They also have high levels of insulin and resistance to insulin's effects. The high insulin levels are a marker for other health concerns that occur with this disease.\nAs is true for anyone with high insulin levels, women with polycystic ovaries are more likely to become obese. And they are at a higher risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\nExcess insulin may trigger the ovaries to make extra androgen hormones. So insulin resistance — a change in how efficiently you metabolize food calories — may be a trigger for polycystic ovary syndrome in some women. However, experts are not sure that insulin is always the root of the problem.\nGenetics and the way that some of the body's glands are programmed (the ovaries, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal gland) also play a role in causing this condition.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Polycystic ovary syndrome usually does not cause symptoms before mid-puberty, when the ovaries begin to produce hormones in significant amounts. Women then can have some or all of the following symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If your periods are irregular, a pregnancy test should be done.\nChanges in the growth pattern of your hair or the development of acne may be enough for your doctor to determine that you have a high level of androgens, such as testosterone. If not, blood tests can detect high androgen levels.\nA blood test may also be used to check the level of prolactin, which is a hormone produced in the brain's pituitary gland. Very high prolactin levels can be caused by a pituitary gland tumor, and this problem can cause symptoms that resemble those of polycystic ovary syndrome.\nAs long as other causes of your symptoms have been excluded, your doctor will diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome if a blood test shows a high testosterone level and you are having infrequent or absent menstrual periods. Testosterone can't be tested reliably if you are currently taking birth control pills. Your doctor is likely to check the levels of other hormones that can be associated with high testosterone or can cause similar symptoms, to be more certain about your diagnosis.\nYour doctor may choose to look at your ovaries using ultrasound, especially if the ovaries feel enlarged during your pelvic examination. An ultrasound test is likely to show multiple cysts in the ovary. The test also can be misleading. Some women have all the typical hormone abnormalities of this condition, but their ovaries have not developed cysts. The diagnosis and treatment for these women is no different.\nBecause of the increased risk of diabetes and heart disease that goes along with this condition, it is very important to have your blood sugar and your cholesterol tested periodically. The American Diabetes Association suggests that people with this condition should have periodic blood sugar tests.\n",
      "Expected duration": "This problem begins in puberty and lasts until the ovaries stop producing hormones due to menopause. The insulin resistance, high insulin levels, diabetes risk and heart disease risk usually last throughout life.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is currently no way for most people to prevent polycystic ovary syndrome. Our understanding of problems relating to insulin resistance is improving rapidly, and some scientists are hopeful that we eventually will be able to prevent some cases of polycystic ovary syndrome if we can identify and treat insulin resistance in its earliest stages.\nTreatment for polycystic ovary disease can prevent complications such as uterine cancer. Because you have an increased risk of heart disease if you have this condition, it is very important that you avoid smoking, maintain a healthy exercise regimen and follow a healthy diet.\nIf you have epilepsy and you have any features of polycystic ovary syndrome, you probably want to take other anti-seizure medicines rather than valproic acid (Depakote, Depakene). This medicine affects the metabolism of some reproductive hormones within the body, and may worsen your symptoms.\n",
      "Treatment": "Weight loss, diet and exercise are recommended for all women with polycystic ovary disease to prevent obesity and to help prevent heart disease and diabetes. Other treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome depends upon your symptoms and whether you want to become pregnant.\nRestoring normal menstrual cycles can help reduce the risk of cancer in the uterus. This can be accomplished using pill supplements of progesterone for 10 to 14 days each month. Another way to restore menstrual cycles is to take birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone. The estrogen seems to signal the ovaries that they can take a break from producing female sex hormones. In women who are taking birth control pills, the ovaries also decrease their production of androgens. After six months on birth control pills, side effects of hair growth and acne usually show significant improvement.\nFor women who still have problems with unwanted hair and acne, an anti-androgen medicine can help. The most commonly used anti-androgen medicine is spironolactone (Aldactone), although others are available. Plucking or cosmetic laser treatment (electrolysis) also can be used for hair removal.\nIt is now possible to help about 75% of women with this condition to become pregnant. Clomiphene citrate is the main treatment. This is a medicine that helps the ovary to release its eggs.\nYour doctor may prescribe diabetes medicines that reduce insulin resistance. Several diabetes medicines — such as metformin (Glucophage, generic versions) and pioglitazone (Actos, generic versions) — can decrease testosterone levels, restore normal menstrual cycles and restore fertility.\nIf they occur along with polycystic ovary syndrome, high cholesterol, high blood pressure or diabetes should be treated. Although surgery used to be a common treatment for polycystic ovaries, it is used only rarely now. Removing a section or sections of the ovary with procedures called wedge resection or ovarian drilling can decrease the amount of androgen hormones in the body and temporarily improve symptoms.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have any of the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome, you should see your health care professional, especially if you have had irregular periods for more than six months.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With treatment, symptoms may improve or go away. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome need to pay strict attention throughout their life to ways they can reduce their risks of heart disease and diabetes.\n",

      "What is it?": "Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory condition that causes pain in the joints and muscles of the lower back, thighs, hips, neck, shoulder and upper arms, and other parts of the body.\nThe condition occurs when the lining surrounding the joints, bursa and tendons near the shoulders and hips becomes inflamed.\nThe disease is centered on the joints (especially the shoulders and hips). But the discomfort is felt in the upper arms and thighs. This type of pain is called referred pain. It arises in one area but causes symptoms in another.\nTypically, polymyalgia rheumatica affects people older than 55. Left untreated, it can lead to stiffness and significant disability. In some cases, symptoms do not get worse. They may even lessen in a few years.\nIn a minority of cases, polymyalgia rheumatica is associated with giant cell arteritis (also called temporal arteritis). This is a condition in which blood vessels are inflamed, especially in the neck and head. Untreated giant cell arteritis can cause vision loss or stroke.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica tend to start suddenly and may include:\nThe pain and stiffness tends to be worse in the morning.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will diagnose this condition based on a combination of:\nCertain symptoms may suggest the presence of giant cell arteritis. These include scalp pain, headache, fever, or jaw pain when you chew.\nAn erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) blood test may be requested to measure inflammation throughout the body. Markers of inflammation are often elevated in people with this condition. The ESR and CRP tests may be used both to diagnose the condition and to check whether treatment is working.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Without treatment, polymyalgia rheumatica sometimes goes away on its own over several years. With treatment, symptoms lessen or go away within days.\nTreatment is generally necessary for at least six months. And it often continues for one to two years or even longer. Symptoms tend to come back if you stop or decrease your treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no known way to prevent polymyalgia rheumatica.\n",
      "Treatment": "Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are usually required to effectively treat polymyalgia rheumatica. Low doses (such as prednisone, 10 mg to 20 mg per day) are highly effective.\nDoctors may prescribe additional medications to prevent the side effects of prednisone. For example, calcium, vitamin D and alendronate (Fosamax) may be prescribed to prevent osteoporosis.\nFor people who have significant side effects from corticosteroids or when the dose of corticosteroids cannot be reduced to low doses without a return of symptoms, other drugs may be prescribed. In February, 2023, sarilumab (Kevzara) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica when corticosteroid treatment is not effective enough or when a reduction in dose leads to increased symptoms. Other medications that may be helpful in this situation include hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), methotrexate (Rheumatrex) or tocilizumab (Actemra).\nPhysical therapy may help to control discomfort. It can also help maintain the ability to move and function.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have joint or muscle pain that is severe or sudden, especially if it prevents you from participating in your normal activities, contact your doctor.\nThe situation may be urgent if you have fever, visual problems or headache. These symptoms suggest that you could have giant cell arteritis.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Treatment may be required for years. But the outlook for people with polymyalgia rheumatica is excellent.\nIf you also have giant cell arteritis, you may lose vision or develop other vascular complications (such as an aortic aneurysm). However, effective therapy is available to prevent these complications. The prognosis of giant cell arteritis is also affected by potential side effects of treatment, particularly those of high dose corticosteroids that are necessary to treat this disease.\n",

      "What is it?": "Post-polio syndrome is an illness defined by a collection of symptoms that generally occur at least 10-20 years after infection with the polio virus. The hallmark of post-polio syndrome is new muscular weakness. This may present as weakness in the arms, legs, or trunk or difficulty with swallowing, talking or breathing if the muscles that control these functions are affected. Other symptoms of post-polio syndrome include muscle pain, fatigue and cold intolerance. It is not uncommon for polio survivors to have new weakness in muscles that were previously believed to be unaffected by polio. This may be because they really weren't sure which muscles were affected many years before, or because muscles were so mildly affected at first that doctors didn't detect it on physical examination at the time of the polio virus infection.\nPolio is a disease caused by an infection with the poliovirus. From the early 20th Century through the 1960's in the United States, epidemics of polio affected many people. The creation of polio vaccines has practically eliminated polio in the United States, and most of the developed nations of the world. However, people in the U.S. and elsewhere who were infected by the virus before vaccines were developed can develop post-polio syndrome.\nTo understand post-polio syndrome, you need to understand what happens in polio. In a small number of cases of polio (less than 10%), the virus will attack the cells in the spinal cord and cause paralysis. However, many people who were infected by the poliovirus did not develop paralysis. Fortunately, many just had typical symptoms of an infection — fever, aching muscles, fatigue, etc. — that lasted a few days, and thereafter regained complete health.\nOthers may have had mild muscular weakness, so mild that neither they nor their doctor noted it. Along with patients who developed obvious weakness (paralysis), patients with milder weakness are at risk for getting post-polio syndrome decades later.\nIt's not clear how many polio survivors will be affected by post-polio syndrome. It's also not clear why some polio survivors develop post-polio syndrome while others do not.\nOne theory is overuse of the nerves and muscles that remained working after the initial infection. For example, if some of the nerves and muscles that are necessary for leg strength are damaged, the remaining nerves and muscles of the legs need to work harder to compensate. After many years of having to work harder, these nerves and muscles become exhausted. Some of them even die. This then forces the nerves and muscles that are left to work even harder, and so a vicious cycle sets in.\nPolio that affects the spinal cord usually destroys many of the motor neurons (nerve cells) that control the muscles of the body. During recovery from polio, you can't build new nerve cells. However, you can create new connections between surviving nerve cells and muscles, so you can recover your muscle strength by \"re-wiring\" your nerve connections. This is an effective way for your nervous system to compensate for polio, but it may be temporary.\nNormal aging likely also contributes to new weakness. Nervous system damaged by polio years earlier goes through a natural aging process that includes the loss of some strength.\nIn addition, as the years pass, nerve cells can be disabled or damaged by illness, injury, your own immune system or natural aging. Delicate connections between nerves and muscles can be lost during periods of inactivity. If you are already relying on a smaller number of nerve and muscle cells than is normal, this loss of other nerve cells over time might leave you more susceptible to weakness that you might not otherwise notice.\nOne theory for post-polio syndrome is that some of the poliovirus remains alive in the brain and spinal cord. This theory is controversial.\nPeople usually are affected by post-polio syndrome during middle or late adult life, decades after they first developed polio, after a long period of stability. The new symptoms sometimes emerge after an illness or injury.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Major symptoms include muscle weakness, pain, fatigue and, in some cases, wasting (atrophy) of the muscles that were involved during the polio infection, typically the legs. Additional problems can include intolerance to heat or cold, and difficulty swallowing, talking, breathing or sleeping. The syndrome also can cause abnormal muscle contractions, such as quivering or spasms, in small segments of a muscle. Worsening disability may cause social and psychological problems.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "There is no specific test that diagnoses post-polio syndrome. Instead, the diagnosis is made by confirming an old history of polio (based on history, physical examination and a muscle test called an electromyogram, or EMG). In addition to these, there needs to be a period of partial recovery after the initial illness and a long stable period without new symptoms (at least 10-20 years). Finally, other reasons why someone may be experiencing new symptoms need to be ruled out.\nYour doctor will ask about your medical history, especially your history of polio. A neurological exam can identify muscle weakness and atrophy. An EMG can help to diagnose this disease. In this procedure, small needles are inserted into several areas of muscle. Of note, EMGs are often done in conjunction with another test called nerve conduction studies (NCS) which don't typically use needles but instead have surface electrodes that deliver small amounts of electricity to test the nerves. Sometimes, muscle biopsies are ordered, although these tests provide only supporting evidence—not proof—of the diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Post-polio syndrome worsens slowly over time.\n",
      "Prevention": "In people who have a history of polio, there is no good way to prevent post-polio syndrome. Obviously, the way to prevent post-polio syndrome in children and adults who never had polio or the polio vaccine is to prevent polio itself through vaccination, when recommended by the doctor.\n",
      "Treatment": "Specific treatment for post-polio syndrome includes a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation approach. Physical therapy may be used to increase muscle strength and endurance and to help with improving balance and preventing falls. Occupational therapists can address upper extremity problems, especially overuse injuries, as well as recommend adaptive equipment for your home and/or office. Speech and language pathologists evaluate and treat swallowing and speech problems. Orthotists can fit you for an up-to-date brace.\nNeurologists and physiatrists are usually the physician specialists who care for people with post-polio syndrome. Physiatrists are doctors who specialize in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) and can help to both establish the diagnosis and treat any symptoms. Both physiatrists and neurologists are often trained in performing EMG testing.\nFor treatment, these doctors may prescribe medications to help with pain and/or fatigue or perform injections. They may recommend sleep studies and prescribe treatments that help with breathing at night. They can write specific therapy orders, brace prescriptions and help coordinate the multi-disciplinary interventions. Complications that involve swallowing or breathing disturbances (such as sleep apnea) require specific treatments. Examples might include using different positions during meals, or an air-pressure mask and machine that can be used during sleep to support breathing. Counseling with a psychologist or vocational counselor can help with psychological or occupational adjustments. Support groups offer education, support and social opportunities.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call a health care professional if you have had polio, and notice changes in muscle strength, decreased endurance, muscle wasting or abnormal muscle twitching. Difficulties swallowing, breathing or sleeping also require medical attention.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Post-polio syndrome usually worsens slowly. With a combination of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation approaches and lifestyle modifications, people often can return to or approach their previous level of functioning. Post-polio syndrome does not usually cause symptoms that are as severe as the original polio illness.\n",

      "What are PCL injuries?": "The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are two tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect the thighbone (femur) and the large bone of the lower leg (tibia) at the knee joint. Together, the ACL and PCL bridge the inside of the knee joint, forming an X pattern that stabilizes the knee against front-to-back and back-to-front forces. In particular, the PCL prevents the lower leg from slipping too far back in relation to the upper leg, especially when the knee is flexed (bent).\n\nA PCL injury includes a stretch or tear of the ligament. The PCL most often is injured when the front of the knee hits the dashboard during an automobile accident. During sports activities, the PCL also can tear when an athlete falls forward and lands hard on a bent knee, which is common in football, basketball, soccer, and rugby.\nLike other types of sprains, PCL injuries are classified according to a traditional grading system.\nOverall, some degree of PCL damage is common among people who are treated for knee injuries in an emergency department. Athletes have more PCL injuries than any other group, with football players and rugby players having the most and basketball players close behind. Because a mild PCL sprain may not cause pain or movement problems right away, many athletes finish a game after their injury. Some have such mild symptoms that they never seek medical care, and the torn PCL is discovered only when they have diagnostic tests for some other type of knee injury.\n",
      "Symptoms of PCL injuries": "Symptoms of a PCL injury may include:\nBecause the first symptoms of a PCL tear may not interfere significantly with an athlete's ability to play sports, many athletes with PCL injuries wait several weeks before they see a doctor. At that first office visit, the athlete may describe vague or nonspecific symptoms — for example, that the injured knee simply doesn't feel \"the way it should.\"\n",
      "Diagnosing PCL injuries": "Your doctor will ask you to describe exactly how you hurt your knee. He or she will want to know whether you had a recent serious impact to the front of your knee, the type of impact (fall, automobile collision), the position of your knee at the time of injury (flexed, extended, twisted), and what symptoms you are having now.\nThe doctor will examine both of your knees, comparing your injured knee with your uninjured one. During this exam, the doctor will check your injured knee for swelling, deformity, tenderness, fluid inside the knee joint, and discoloration. After determining your knee's range of motion (how far it can move), the doctor will pull against the ligaments to check their strength. You will be asked to bend your knee while the doctor gently pushes forward on your lower leg where it meets the knee. If your PCL is torn, your lower leg can often be moved backward in relation to the knee. The more your lower leg can be moved away from its normal position, the greater the amount of PCL damage and the more unstable your knee.\nIf your symptoms and physical examination suggests you have a PCL injury, you may need special diagnostic tests. These may include standard knee x-rays to check whether the PCL has separated from bone and for other bone damage, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or camera-guided knee surgery (arthroscopy).\n\n",
      "Expected duration of PCL injuries": "How long a PCL injury lasts depends on the severity of your injury, your rehabilitation program, and the types of sports you play. Symptoms from milder sprains may resolve within a few weeks, but it can take a year or more for more severe injuries.\n",
      "Preventing PCL injuries": "To help prevent sports-related knee injuries, you should:\n",
      "Treating PCL injuries": "For all grades of PCL sprains, initial treatment follows the RICE rule:\nYour doctor may also recommend a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others), to relieve any mild pain or swelling. After initial treatment with RICE, further treatment of PCL sprains depends on the grade of the injury:\nSurgery is more likely to be offered to those with Grade III sprains when there are also injuries to nearby ligaments or cartilage.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If your knee becomes swollen, deformed, painful, or unstable after a significant injury, call your doctor for an urgent evaluation.\nIf you develop pain at the front of your knee several weeks after you have injured it, make an appointment to see your doctor. Many PCL sprains are overlooked at the time of injury, so you may have sprained your PCL without realizing it.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most athletes with PCL injuries who are treated without surgery return to their sport at their pre-injury activity level after rehabilitation. For Grade I or II sprains, recovery may be as soon as several weeks to several months. For PCL injuries requiring surgery, full recovery may take a year or more. Recovery tends to be faster and more complete among those who are younger, have good physical function prior to the injury, and closely follow their recommended rehabilitation program.\nAs a long-term complication, many (but not all) patients with PCL injuries develop osteoarthritis in the injured knee joint, which may develop a decade or more after the initial PCL injury.\n",

      "What is postpartum depression?": "Postpartum refers to the period immediately after childbirth. When a woman has significant symptoms of depression during this period, she is said to have postpartum depression.\nPostpartum depression is not the same as the \"baby blues,\" a much more common condition that affects as many as 85% of new mothers. New moms often are emotionally sensitive and tend to cry easily. The baby blues is uncomfortable, but usually doesn't interfere with functioning as a mother, and it almost always goes away within a few weeks.\nPostpartum depression is a different matter. It affects up to 15% of new mothers. It may begin at any time in the first two to three months after giving birth. The mother feels sad or hopeless and sometimes guilty or worthless. She is unable to concentrate and unable to take any interest in anything, even the baby. In some cases, the mother may feel overwhelmed by the baby's needs and become intensely anxious. This may lead to persistent troubling thoughts or obsessions about the baby's well-being and compulsive repetitive actions, such as checking on the baby constantly or phoning the pediatrician repeatedly to ask questions.\nA woman is more likely to develop postpartum depression if she has:\nTeenage mothers, particularly if they come from families with few economic resources, have a particularly high risk of postpartum depression.\nIn a rare form of this disorder, which occurs in one out of 1,000 births, the mother becomes psychotic — that is, she is unable to recognize reality. This condition is sometimes called postpartum psychosis. The mother may have hallucinations (altered perceptions, for example, hearing or smelling things that are not there) or delusions (false beliefs, such as the idea that her baby is possessed by the devil).\nThis condition is most commonly associated with bipolar disorder. It is extremely dangerous for both the mother and the baby. And once it has happened it is highly likely to happen again if the mother has another child.\nResearchers have many reasons to assume that biological changes contribute to these mood problems. In the weeks after delivery, significant swings occur in sex hormone levels and in the regulation of stress hormones. In postpartum depression, perhaps as a response to the hormonal shifts, there may be subtle changes in the parts of the brain that process emotion and in the brain regions responsible for managing social interactions. These changes are important not just for the mother, but also for the new baby.\nFewer than half of women with postpartum depression seek treatment for the problem. Some new mothers are unaware that postpartum depression is a real, treatable illness. Others believe that they are expected to feel happy after having a baby, and are so embarrassed about their symptoms that they do not ask for help.\n",
      "Symptoms of postpartum depression": "A woman with postpartum depression can have any of the following symptoms:\nThese symptoms may develop in the first days after birth or as long as three months later.\n",
      "Diagnosing postpartum depression": "Primary care physicians, obstetrician/gynecologists and pediatricians may screen for postpartum depression by asking questions about the mother's quality of life. If you are a new mother, your doctor may ask about your emotions, your sleep and your appetite. You may be asked two questions for screening purposes:\nAnother scale frequently used for screening is the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This is a 10-question scale that you can answer to give you and your doctor a measure of how depressed you might be. The scale with instructions is freely available online.\nIf your primary care doctor or obstetrician/gynecologist believes you have symptoms of postpartum depression, and these symptoms have lasted for several weeks without improving, he or she may offer you an antidepressant or refer you to a psychiatrist or other mental health clinician for further evaluation. If your doctor is concerned that some of your symptoms may be caused by a medical illness, he or she may order blood tests to check for such conditions as anemia or an underactive thyroid.\n",
      "Expected duration of postpartum depression": "Usually, symptoms of postpartum depression last for a few weeks before the condition is diagnosed. Without treatment, symptoms can last for months. With treatment, many women feel better within weeks.\n",
      "Preventing postpartum depression": "If you are pregnant, you may be able to decrease your risk of postpartum depression by preparing yourself before the birth for the changes in lifestyle that motherhood will bring. Talk to other mothers and to your doctor in very practical, day-to-day terms about what it's like to care for an infant. Don't underestimate how much time you'll need with your newborn. Clear out as much time as you can during the period after birth. Also, don't hesitate to ask for help from your partner and others who care about you.\nOften, postpartum depression is difficult to combat without antidepressant treatment. If you have a history of depression, postpartum depression or bipolar disorder, you should talk with your doctor before the birth about the possibility of starting antidepressant medication soon after your baby is born. As a general rule, doctors try to minimize the amount of medication prescribed during pregnancy, but sometimes the risks of depression are more significant than the risk to the fetus. It is very important to discuss these trade-offs with your doctor.\n",
      "Treating postpartum depression": "As with other types of depression, a combination of psychotherapy and medication is most helpful. If a mother is exhibiting signs of psychosis, she needs immediate medical attention.\nA number of psychotherapy techniques have been proven helpful depending on the nature of the stress, the cause of the depression and personal preference. Every woman with postpartum depression needs support as well as education about depression. Various types of psychological therapy are available.\nThe antidepressants used for treating other types of depression are also effective for postpartum depression. Among others, the choices include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine. As with depression treatment in general, there are many medication options available. The treatment you choose will be influenced by such factors as potential side effects or past treatments.\nIf you are breastfeeding, you are likely to have questions about the possibility of passing medication to your newborn. There are wide variations in the concentration of antidepressant in breast milk, depending on such things as the dose, your metabolism and when your baby feeds. Fortunately, most studies show little effect on the baby. Many mothers do choose to take antidepressants, but it is important to discuss the choices with your doctors to assess the risks and the benefits in your situation.\nYou may begin to feel relief soon after starting treatment, but it usually takes at least two to six weeks before a clear improvement can be seen. You may need to try a few different approaches to psychotherapy or medication before you find the method most helpful to you. Keep trying until you get the help you need.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you are a new mother, contact your doctor if you develop any symptoms of postpartum depression, especially anxiety, feelings of intense sadness or hopelessness, or difficulty sleeping. Call your doctor immediately if you have thoughts about harming yourself or the baby, or if you feel that you can no longer cope with caring for your new baby.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most mothers with postpartum depression recover completely. This is especially true if the illness is diagnosed and treated early. About 50% of women who recover from postpartum depression develop the illness again after future pregnancies. To decrease this risk, some doctors suggest that women with a history of postpartum depression should start antidepressants immediately after the baby is delivered, before the onset of depression symptoms.\n",

      "What Is It?": "In pre-diabetes, blood sugar levels are slightly higher than normal, but still not as high as in diabetes. If diabetes is \"runaway blood sugar\" think of pre-diabetes as blood sugar that is \"halfway out the door.\"\nPeople almost always develop pre-diabetes before they get type 2 diabetes. The rise in blood sugar levels that is seen in pre-diabetes starts when the body begins to develop a problem called \"insulin resistance.\" Insulin is an important hormone that helps you to process glucose (blood sugar). If usual amounts of insulin can't trigger the body to move glucose out of the bloodstream and into your cells, then you have insulin resistance.\nOnce insulin resistance begins, it can worsen over time. When you have pre-diabetes, you make extra insulin to keep your sugar levels near to normal. Insulin resistance can worsen as you age, and it worsens with weight gain. If your insulin resistance progresses, eventually you can't compensate well enough by making extra insulin. When this occurs, your sugar levels will increase, and you will have diabetes.\nDepending on what a blood sugar test finds, pre-diabetes can be more specifically called \"impaired glucose (sugar) tolerance\" or \"impaired fasting glucose.\" Impaired fasting glucose means that blood sugar increase after you haven't eaten for a while – for example, in the morning, before breakfast.\nImpaired glucose tolerance means that blood sugar levels reach a surprisingly high level after you eat sugar. To diagnose impaired glucose tolerance, doctors usually use what is called a \"glucose tolerance test.\" For this test you drink a sugary solution, and then you have blood drawn after a short time.\nHaving pre-diabetes does not automatically mean you will get diabetes, but it does put you at an increased risk. Pre-diabetes is also a risk factor for heart disease. Like people with type 2 diabetes, those with pre-diabetes tend to be overweight, have high blood pressure and have unhealthy cholesterol levels.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Pre-diabetes is often called a \"silent\" condition because it usually has no symptoms. You can have pre-diabetes for several years without knowing it. Certain risk factors increase the chance that you have pre-diabetes. These risk factors include:\nIf you have one or more of these risk factors, your doctor may recommend a blood sugar test. An abnormal result is likely to be the first sign that you have pre-diabetes.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The same blood sugar tests that are used for diabetes are used to diagnose pre-diabetes. For diagnosing pre-diabetes, your doctor can order one of the following:\nIn a fasting glucose test, blood sugar levels are measured after at least eight hours of not eating. Most people prefer to have the test done the morning after fasting overnight.\nIn the oral glucose tolerance test, blood sugar levels are first measured after an overnight fast. You then drink a sugary solution, and two hours later another blood sample is drawn. This second test is known as a \"glucose challenge.\" In healthy people, the glucose challenge will cause blood sugar levels to rise slightly and fall quickly. In someone with pre-diabetes or diabetes, these levels rise very high or fall slowly, so they will be abnormally high during the two-hour blood test.\nA hemoglobin A1C blood test can be done at any time during the day. It does not require fasting. The result reflects an average of your blood sugar over the preceding 3 months.\nHere is how to interpret the results of these tests (mg/dL = milligrams per deciliter):\nFasting glucose test\nOral glucose tolerance test\nHemoglobin A1C test\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Pre-diabetes sugar levels can remain slightly above normal, can return to normal, or can increase to a range that leads to a diagnosis of diabetes. As many as 1 in 10 people with impaired glucose tolerance will develop diabetes within one year. What happens to your pre-diabetes depends on whether you are able to prevent insulin resistance from progressing. If insulin resistance is kept in check, pre-diabetes may never become diabetes. If you do not adjust your lifestyle to increase exercise and improve diet, blood sugar levels will probably eventually rise to diabetic levels. Once this happens, medication is usually required to bring your blood sugar back to near-normal levels.\n",
      "Prevention": "It surprises many people to learn that they may be able to prevent pre-diabetes and diabetes. To reduce your risk of both pre-diabetes and diabetes:\nIf you are overweight, aim to lose weight. Even modest weight loss of 10 or 15 pounds in a person who is 200 pounds can dramatically reduce the risk of diabetes.\n",
      "Treatment": "The purpose for treating pre-diabetes is to prevent diabetes from setting in. The same measures recommended for preventing pre-diabetes (see above) work for treating it, too.\nThe most effective treatment for pre-diabetes is to lose weight and exercise at least 30 minutes a day. Weight loss and exercise can improve insulin resistance and can lower elevated blood sugar levels so that you don't progress to develop diabetes.\nAdditionally, the drug metformin (Glucophage) can lower the risk of getting diabetes, and it can add to the benefits of weight loss and exercise. Check with your doctor about whether taking metformin to prevent diabetes is a good idea for you. If your doctor feels that you have an especially high risk for progressing to diabetes, you may want to consider preventive treatment with this medication.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "It's best to have annual glucose tests to monitor pre-diabetes. Also, look for symptoms that can suggest the development of new diabetes, such as:\n",
      "Prognosis": "If you have pre-diabetes, you have about a 10% chance of developing type 2 diabetes within one year. Your chance of developing type 2 diabetes during your lifetime is roughly 70%.\nFortunately, improvements in diet and exercise habits can help to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. Research has shown that people with pre-diabetes who lose 5% to 7% of their body weight and exercise about 30 minutes a day can reduce their risk for diabetes during the next 3 years by almost 60%.\nPeople with pre-diabetes have a higher risk of heart disease than average, even before diabetes develops. With the onset of diabetes, your risks for heart disease and stroke increase sharply. Diabetes also leads to complications such as blindness, kidney failure, foot ulcers, pain with walking due to poor circulation, and nerve damage. That's why it's important to take action to improve your health when you are diagnosed with pre-diabetes.\n",

      "What is it?": "Preeclampsia is a condition that begins during pregnancy, usually after the 20th week. However, the symptoms and signs of preeclampsia may persist after delivery, and rarely the condition might not be recognized until after the baby is born. A woman with preeclampsia develops high blood pressure and usually protein in her urine, and she often has swelling (edema) of the legs, hands, face, or entire body.\nWhen preeclampsia becomes severe, it can cause dangerous complications for the mother and the fetus. One of these complications is eclampsia, the term used when seizures develop in a woman with severe preeclampsia. Another concern is the higher risk of stroke during pregnancy and after delivery.\nExperts are still not entirely sure what causes preeclampsia, but recent research has provided some good clues. Preeclampsia occurs when the placenta does not anchor itself as deeply as expected within the wall of the uterus during the first trimester. This is associated with abnormal vascular development in the connection between the uterine wall and placenta, which may interfere with optimal oxygen and nutrient delivery. What specifically causes these problems is unclear, but it may be influenced by the mother's or father's genes or the mother's immune system, and medical conditions the mother may have, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.\nRegardless of its cause, early abnormalities in placental formation lead to changes that later affect blood vessels and other organs. Arteries throughout the body can tighten (become narrower), raising blood pressure. They can also become \"leaky,\" allowing protein or fluid to seep through their walls, which causes tissues to swell. In preeclampsia, changes in arteries decrease the blood supply to the fetus and placenta, and to the woman's kidneys, liver, eyes, brain, and other organs.\nIn parts of the world with more limited medical care, preeclampsia and eclampsia cause many women to die during pregnancy. Fortunately, with appropriate prenatal care and monitoring, most women with preeclampsia and eclampsia and their babies survive just fine.\nEclampsia and, especially, death from preeclampsia, are rare in well-resourced countries like the United States. However, even with the best care, preeclampsia is a leading cause of illness for mothers and newborns. The following conditions increase the chance that a woman will develop preeclampsia:\n",
      "Symptoms": "A woman with mild preeclampsia may not notice any symptoms, or she may have only mild swelling of the hands or feet. However, most pregnant women have some degree of swelling of the feet. So not all swelling indicates preeclampsia.\nSymptoms of severe preeclampsia can include\nWhen preeclampsia is severe it may progress to cause seizures. Most often they are generalized seizures, causing a woman to lose consciousness and have jerking movements of the arms and legs. She also may lose control of her bladder or bowels.\nSevere preeclampsia also increases a woman's risk of stroke during pregnancy. This risk persists even after delivery but can be minimized by good blood pressure control.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Because preeclampsia doesn't always cause noticeable symptoms, it is crucial that all pregnant women see a health care professional regularly during pregnancy for prenatal care. This gives you the best chance of having preeclampsia diagnosed and managed before it becomes severe. Your doctor or midwife will measure your blood pressure and test your urine for protein at each prenatal visit because abnormal results are the earliest, most common signs of preeclampsia.\n\nPreeclampsia can be especially difficult to detect in women who have a history of high blood pressure (hypertension) before pregnancy. One in four women with high blood pressure will develop preeclampsia during pregnancy, so it is essential that these women be monitored closely for changes in blood pressure and for protein in the urine.\nYour doctor or midwife will diagnose preeclampsia depending on your symptoms and the results of certain tests. There is no one blood test currently available to determine if someone does or does not have preeclampsia. Since a simple blood test is not available, the diagnosis is determined based on several findings.\nPreeclampsia without severe features(what used to be called \"mild preeclampsia\") is characterized by the following:\nPreeclampsiawith severe features(formerly called \"severe preeclampsia\") is characterized by:\nOR\nEclampsiais diagnosed when a woman with preeclampsia has seizures. These seizures usually happen in women who have severe preeclampsia, though they can occur with preeclampsia. Eclampsia also can happen soon after a woman gives birth. Approximately 30% to 50% of patients with eclampsia also have the HELLP syndrome.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Preeclampsia can begin as early as the 20th week of pregnancy, or very rarely even earlier. But it is more likely to develop during the last three months of pregnancy. In fact, the majority of cases are diagnosed in the last weeks of pregnancy. When a diagnosis of preeclampsia is made long before delivery, the woman will be closely monitored; sometimes this needs to occur in the hospital.\nIf the condition worsens and threatens the health of the mother or fetus, delivery is usually recommended. But this also depends on whether the fetus is fully or near fully developed.\nIn most cases, the features of preeclampsia will start to improve after delivery. However, for reasons that are poorly understood, sometimes preeclampsia gets worse or actually is first recognized after delivery.\n",
      "Prevention": "Currently there are few recommendations that can be made to prevent preeclampsia. Because certain health problems (diabetes, high blood pressure, lupus) are associated with preeclampsia, women should be in the best health possible before becoming pregnant. This includes not being overweight, staying physically active, and gaining the appropriate weight once pregnant.\nExpert groups recommend that women who are risk of preeclampsia, especially those at high risk (for example, women who have had severe or early preeclampsia with a previous pregnancy) take a low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia. The protection offered by taking a baby aspirin for women at average risk is less clear.\nGetting prenatal care is one of the most important things you can do to keep yourself healthy during pregnancy. Preeclampsia is one of the many things your doctor or midwife will be on the lookout for.\nIn women whose preeclampsia is getting markedly worse, magnesium sulfate and good blood pressure control can help prevent eclamptic seizures and other complications of preeclampsia. Magnesium sulfate may be given either through an intravenous line or as an injection.\n",
      "Treatment": "The optimal therapy for preeclampsia and eclampsia is to deliver the baby. (Actually, it's the delivery of the placenta, but one can't deliver the placenta without delivering the baby.) But complications can still arise after delivery, so close monitoring needs to continue, such as keeping blood pressure well controlled.\nHow you proceed depends on the severity of your preeclampsia.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should schedule your first prenatal care visit with a health care professional as soon as you know you are pregnant. If you have swelling, severe headache, changes in vision, or other symptoms of preeclampsia, contact your doctor or midwife immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for full recovery from preeclampsia is very good. Most women begin to improve within one to two days after delivery, and blood pressure returns to their normal pre-pregnancy range within the next one to six weeks in almost all cases. However, for some women, there is still a risk of complications during this time.\nAbout one of every five women with preeclampsia during a first pregnancy will have preeclampsia during a second pregnancy. Those with early or severe preeclampsia, or who have other medical conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes, are at greatest risk for recurrence.\nWomen who have had preeclampsia are at risk for developing high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases later in life. You should let your primary care provider know if you have had preeclampsia. Although at present no specific treatments are recommended for women who have had preeclampsia to prevent later problems, it is prudent to adopt a healthy lifestyle. This includes\n",

When premature ejaculation happens so frequently that it interferes with the sexual pleasure of a man or his partner, it becomes a medical problem.\nSeveral factors may contribute to premature ejaculation. Psychological problems such as stress, depression and other factors that affect mental and emotional health can aggravate this condition. However, there is growing evidence that biological factors can make some men more prone to experience premature ejaculation.\nRarely, premature ejaculation can be caused by a specific physical problem, such as inflammation of the prostate gland or a spinal cord problem.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The key symptoms of premature ejaculation include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Premature ejaculation is diagnosed based on typical symptoms. To understand your problem, your doctor will need to discuss your sexual history with you. Be frank and open. The more your doctor knows, the better he or she can help you.\nIf your sexual history fails to reveal significant mental or emotional factors that may contribute to premature ejaculation, your doctor may want to examine you. Your doctor may examine your prostate or do neurological tests (tests of your nervous system) to determine if there is a physical problem that could be causing premature ejaculation.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Sometimes, premature ejaculation goes away on its own over weeks or months. Working to relieve stress or other psychological issues may help the situation to improve.\nOther men have lasting difficulties with premature ejaculation, and require professional help. Some men respond to treatment promptly, while others struggle with this problem over a prolonged period. Effective treatment is available.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no known way to prevent premature ejaculation. However, you should consider the following advice:\n",
      "Treatment": "Behavioral therapy is one possible approach for treating premature ejaculation. Most commonly, the \"squeeze technique\" is used. If a man senses that he is about to experience premature orgasm, he interrupts sexual relations. Then the man or his partner squeezes the shaft of his penis between a thumb and two fingers. The man or his partner applies light pressure just below the head of the penis for about 20 seconds, lets go, and then sexual relations can be resumed. The technique can be repeated as often as necessary. When this technique is successful, it enables the man to learn to delay ejaculation with the squeeze, and eventually, to gain control over ejaculation without the squeeze. Behavioral therapy helps 60% to 90% of men with premature ejaculation. However, it requires the cooperation of both partners. Also, premature ejaculation often returns, and additional behavioral therapy may be needed.\nAnother possible treatment is prescription medication that helps to delay ejaculation. Delayed orgasm is a common side effect of certain drugs, particularly those used to treat depression. This is true even for men who are not depressed. When this type of medication is given to men who experience premature ejaculation, it can help to postpone orgasm for up to several minutes. Drugs used for this type of treatment include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil) or sertraline (Zoloft); and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine (Anafranil).\nSome men with premature ejaculation may benefit from drugs called phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil (Cialis) and avanafil (Stendra). A phosphodiesterase inhibitor can be used alone or in combination with an SSRI. One drug should be started at a time, preferably at a low dose.\nSome men with premature ejaculation also benefit from reducing the stimulation they experience during sex. A number of creams are available that can partially anesthetize (numb) the penis and reduce the stimulation that leads to orgasm. Another option is to use one or more condoms. However, these techniques may interfere with the pleasure experienced during sex.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Speak with your doctor if you consistently ejaculate before you want to. Remember, one instance of premature ejaculation does not mean that you have a condition that requires treatment. Your doctor may refer you to a sex therapist if premature ejaculation is causing major problems in your sex life or personal relationships or if you would like to consider behavioral therapy.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many men experience a brief period of premature ejaculation, then improve on their own. Even for men who require medical treatment, the outlook is usually good.\n",

      "What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a collection of symptoms that many women experience during the several days and sometimes longer before a menstrual period. These symptoms may be physical, psychological and emotional. They disappear soon after the start of menstrual bleeding.\nResearchers are not certain what causes PMS. The most popular explanation is that PMS symptoms are related to cyclic changes in:\nLifestyle may play a significant role in PMS. PMS symptoms appear to be most troubling in women who:\nHowever, it's not clear whether these factors increase your risk of PMS or if PMS accounts for these differences in lifestyle. For example, it is more likely that PMS causes stress rather than that stress causes PMS.\nMedications may exaggerate the symptoms of PMS. Oral contraceptives cause symptoms of PMS in some women. However, in some women, symptoms improve or disappear while using birth control pills.\nThere is some controversy in the medical community about the difference between premenstrual discomfort and true PMS. Premenstrual discomfort is fairly common among women of childbearing age. It affects about three-quarters of all menstruating women.\nHowever, fewer than one in ten women have symptoms that are severe enough to disrupt their personal relationships or interfere with their work and home responsibilities. Some doctors feel that only women who have such severe symptoms have true PMS.\nOther doctors use a less stringent definition for PMS. Their definition includes mild to moderate symptoms.\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS. Women with this disorder have 5 or more PMS symptoms, and they also experience mood swings, anger, irritability, tension and/or anxiety.\n",
      "Symptoms of PMS": "Symptoms of PMS fall into two general categories:\nPhysical symptoms\nPsychological and emotional symptoms\nThe specific symptoms of PMS vary from woman to woman. But the top three complaints are irritability, fatigue, and bloating.\n",
      "Diagnosing PMS": "Your doctor will ask you about:\nYour doctor also will ask about the general quality of your life. Questions may include:\nNext, your doctor will review your medical history. He or she will ask about any medications that you are taking.\nThen, your doctor will examine you. He or she will do a pelvic exam with a Pap smear.\nNo single physical finding can confirm the diagnosis of PMS. But a thorough physical exam can check for other medical problems. These may include hypothyroidism or a tumor of the breast, brain or ovary.\nSimilarly, no single laboratory test can confirm that you have PMS. But blood tests can rule out medical disorders. These may include hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism or other hormonal problems that may be causing your symptoms.\nIf there are no physical findings and your laboratory test results are normal, then your doctor may ask you to keep a daily record of your PMS symptoms. You will do this for two or three months. This record will include:\nOnce this record is complete, your doctor will review the information. If your symptoms follow a pattern that is consistent with PMS, then this will help to establish the diagnosis.\nGenerally, premenstrual symptoms must be absent for about two weeks to qualify for the diagnosis of PMS. Symptoms will be absent from shortly after the start of menstruation until the next ovulation.\n",
      "Expected duration of PMS": "PMS can be a long-term condition. In some women, symptoms of PMS flare up before every menstrual period. This pattern continues until menopause. Menopause is the age-related end to menstrual cycles.\nIn other women, PMS symptoms seem to decrease after age 35.\n",
      "Preventing PMS": "Because doctors are not exactly sure what causes PMS, there is no way to prevent it. However, you may be able to alleviate some PMS symptoms by leading a healthier lifestyle.\n",
      "Treating PMS": "The treatment of PMS depends on:\nFor example, your symptoms may be mild. They may not interfere with your daily life or personal relationships. In this case, your doctor may suggest that you try one or more of the following lifestyle changes:\nIf your symptoms are moderate to severe, your doctor probably will prescribe medications. These medications are aimed at relieving specific symptoms. For example, oral contraceptives, especially those that contain both estrogen and progestin, may minimize the severity of cramps and the length of your period.\nYour doctor may suggest that you try an antidepressant medication. This is likely if you have symptoms that interfere with your work or home responsibilities or your personal relationships. These symptoms may include irritability, social withdrawal, angry outbursts or depression.\nThe most effective antidepressants for relieving PMS are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Examples include:\nLess commonly, your doctor may prescribe a medication that causes the ovaries to stop producing estrogen, so that ovulation stops. This is usually reserved for very severe symptoms, or when other medications fail. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, such as leuprolide (Lupron), create a temporary menopausal state. They do this by suppressing hormones that control the production of ovarian hormones and ovulation.\nThese medications are generally used for short periods of time. They commonly lead to hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause. If therapy needs to continue for more than six months, you will also have to take estrogen to prevent bone loss.\nWhether your symptoms are mild or severe, it always helps to have your family's understanding and support while you are being treated for PMS. Your doctor will encourage you to speak frankly with family members about your symptoms and your PMS treatment.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if your premenstrual symptoms:\nIf you think you are in danger of causing harm to yourself or others, call your doctor for an emergency appointment.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most women, PMS symptoms begin to subside after age 35. They end at menopause. Women who have PMS or PMDD are at greater risk of developing depression.\n",

      "What is it?": "As we age, the lens of the eye becomes increasingly inflexible, making it harder to focus clearly on near objects. This is called presbyopia. These changes happen to everyone as a natural part of aging.\nIn order for us to see images clearly, light rays enter the eye, where the lens bends and focuses the rays on the retina. The lens changes shape to allow the eye to focus on objects at different distances. Beginning early in life — perhaps as early as age 10 — our lenses gradually stiffen and begin to lose the ability to change shape. By the time we are in our 40s, the lens has trouble focusing up close, and we begin to experience blurred vision when we try to do tasks that require up-close focus, such as reading or needlework. The lens continues to stiffen until about age 65, when nearly all its flexibility has been lost.\nPresbyopia eventually affects everyone, even people who are already farsighted (hyperopic) or nearsighted (myopic). Because people who are farsighted already need to work when focusing on near objects, they may experience presbyopia a little earlier in life. People who are nearsighted will still experience presbyopia when wearing their corrective glasses or contact lenses for distance. However, for looking at objects or letters closer to them, they will likely be able to see quite clearly when they take off their glasses. This is where the term \"nearsighted\" comes from.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Presbyopia causes the following symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Many people over age 40 diagnose presbyopia themselves based on their inability to read clearly at a distance that used to be natural and comfortable. Because the condition comes on gradually over many years, most people don't notice small vision changes and delay seeking professional help until the focusing problems interfere with daily life. Many optometrists joke that patients seek help only when their arms become \"too short,\" unable to hold printed pages far enough away to see clearly.\nPresbyopia can be diagnosed by an optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician, who will take a complete medical history to determine the extent of your vision problem. He or she will test your vision by having you read text at a distance that is typically comfortable to you. If the doctor diagnoses presbyopia, he or she will do a test to determine the extent of the focusing problem and the appropriate lens prescription. In this test, the doctor has you look through corrective lenses, and continues to increase the magnification power until the words on the page are clear to you and you are comfortable reading.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Presbyopia cannot be reversed and gets worse as we get older. Vision changes stop around age 65. The only exception is that which occurs when people develop a type of cataract that causes them to be myopic (nearsighted). Such cataracts cause \"second sight\". Reading vision returns but of course distance vision becomes blurred.\n",
      "Prevention": "Nothing can be done to prevent presbyopia. It is an inevitable part of aging. However, people who do a lot of close visual work, such as working with a computer or intensive reading, may develop presbyopia earlier than others. If you do close work, take a 10-minute break every one to two hours to relieve strain on the eyes. Allow your eyes to focus on objects at a middle or long distance away to give your eyes a rest from close focusing. Be sure to use bright lighting when reading to help your eyes focus.\n",
      "Treatment": "Presbyopia can be treated with corrective lenses. Glasses are the simplest way to regain your ability to see close objects clearly. If you already wear corrective lenses for nearsightedness or farsightedness you may need two sets of glasses — one for distance vision and one for close vision — or glasses with bifocal lenses, in which the upper portion of the glass corrects for distance and the lower portion for near vision. Your optometrist or vision professional can order the appropriate prescriptions.\nIf you don't already wear corrective lenses or you wear contact lenses, you may choose to wear reading glasses only when necessary to magnify up-close objects. The strength of reading glasses is categorized in increments of .25. Glasses with +.50 have a minimal amount of correction — only two steps. Standard lenses are available up to +6.00 (24 steps of reading correction), but typically range from +1.00 (four steps) to +2.50 (10 steps). Your vision professional can tell you what amount of correction is best for your eyes.\nStandard, inexpensive reading glasses are available in most drugstores, supermarkets and office supply stores. They are rated on the same vision correction scale, so if you know the amount of correction you need, you can purchase the right pair for you. If you don't know how much correction you need, test the glasses in the store by trying to read text at a comfortable distance using different magnification strengths. The one that allows you to read most clearly is the right power for you.\nStandard, off-the-rack reading glasses may not be right for everyone. Many people need different amounts of correction in each eye, and therefore require custom glasses. Also, custom glasses usually are made of better materials and are shaped to allow your eyes to focus properly across the full range of the lens.\nBecause presbyopia continues to get worse as we age, the magnification you need may change over time.\nContact lenses also can be used to treat presbyopia, although many people find it difficult to adjust to them. Bifocal contact lenses can be made, or you can get monovision lenses, in which one eye has a contact lens with a prescription for distance vision, and the other eye has a contact lens for up-close vision.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Although there is no harm in delaying treatment for presbyopia, optometrists recommend seeing a professional whenever you have blurred vision because this can indicate other vision or health problems. For example, cataracts also can cause blurred vision, and diabetes, multiple sclerosis, vascular disease and other diseases can affect vision. If your vision suddenly blurs, or if you have eye pain or double vision, see black spots or light flashes or have other visual problems, see your doctor immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The condition will continue to get worse, and then stabilize. With proper corrective glasses or contact lenses, you'll still be able to read and do other close-work as well as ever.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Priapism is an abnormally prolonged and often painful erection. This erection may not be related to sexual desire or stimulation. It often won't be relieved by orgasm.\nPriapism may start after prolonged sexual activity, although this by itself is not believed to cause priapism. Most men seek medical attention within hours to days, but a few people may have a partial erection that persists for weeks.\nPriapism can affect males of any age. Most cases occur in boys aged 5 to 10 years or men aged 20 to 50 years. In young boys, the most common cause is sickle cell disease. In adult males, the leading cause is drug treatment of erectile dysfunction, especially injection therapy. Other less common causes include recreational drug use, trauma to the genitals or groin, other medications and spinal cord problems.\nIn up to one-third of cases, no specific cause can be found.\nIn a normal erection, the veins that drain blood from the penis narrow and cause blood to back up, which makes the penis stiffen and swell. After the veins relax and open, the penis will not be erect.\nIn most cases of priapism, these veins do not relax after orgasm, which causes the penis to remain erect. Less commonly, priapism occurs when so much blood flows into the penis that it cannot drain, even though veins that function properly. This increased blood flow is usually caused by a damaged blood vessel.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of priapism include:\nA painful erection that lasts longer than to four to six hours and is not relieved by orgasm\nA partial erection that lasts longer than several days, even if it is not painful\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history, and use of medications, drugs and alcohol. He or she will examine you, and will order blood tests. Additional tests may include:\nAn ultrasound or angiogram (X-ray using dye injected into blood vessels) of the penis\nA blood sample from the penis\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Usually priapism does not improve without medical attention.\n",
      "Prevention": "In a few cases, priapism can occur more than once. If this happens, it is important to avoid medications, alcohol or drugs that may trigger these episodes. However, in most men, priapism occurs unexpectedly and cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment for priapism depends on the cause. In most cases, a physician will start by numbing the penis, and will then use a needle to remove trapped blood from the swollen penis. Often, the doctor will inject a medication that helps to relax the narrowed veins. Usually, this treatment works promptly.\nMen with semi-erect, painless erections, which are less common, are more likely to have too much blood flowing into the penis rather than narrowed veins. This condition often follows trauma to the penis or groin. After the diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasound, many men can be observed without specific treatment.\nPriapism caused by high flow rarely causes complications. Priapism often resolves over the next one to three days. You should follow up with your doctor. If the priapism persists, your doctor will likely order an angiogram. Dye that can be detected by x-ray is injected into an artery to locate the site of excess blood flow. A procedure to correct the problem may be recommended.\nWhen sickle cell disease causes priapism, treatment usually starts with fluids given intravenously (into a vein), oxygen and transfusion of non-sickle blood. If this treatment is not effective, aspiration therapy as described above or surgery may be required.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "You should call a physician if you develop an erection that lasts longer than four to six hours, particularly if this erection is painful and is not caused by sexual stimulation.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If priapism is treated early, the outcome is usually excellent. However, if medical attention is delayed, the problem can lead to permanent impotence.\n",

      "What is it?": "Prostate cancer results from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the prostate gland. This gland produces part of the fluid in semen. It is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum, near the base of the penis.\nProstate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in American men. Many other men have the disease, but have not been diagnosed. This is because prostate cancer has few symptoms early on.\nProstate cancer is common, but it is not always dangerous. This is because it usually grows very slowly. It affects older men; the average age at diagnosis is 70. And it's usually diagnosed before it causes any symptoms. Also, these men often have other illnesses which may be more important to treat than a cancer that doesn't cause symptoms.\nWhen cells in the prostate become cancerous (malignant), they clump together, forming small \"islands\" of cancer in the prostate. In many cases, it takes years, even decades, for this localized cancer to spread beyond the prostate. And many of these cancers may never spread.\nResearchers do not know the exact cause of prostate cancer. But they have identified several factors that raise a man's risk of the disease. These include:\n",
      "Symptoms": "In its early stages, prostate cancer rarely causes symptoms. In fact, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer have no symptoms. Doctors suspect prostate cancer if a blood test shows high levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). However, if the cancer spreads to the bladder or presses on the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body, it can cause:\nIf prostate cancer spreads to the lymph nodes, bones, or other organs, it can cause\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, your medical history, and whether prostate cancer runs in your family. Your doctor will want to know whether you have ever been diagnosed with an inflamed or enlarged prostate. These conditions are not cancerous. However, the symptoms of these conditions can be the same as symptoms of prostate cancer.\nYour doctor will examine you and do a digital rectal exam (DRE) to feel the prostate gland. During a DRE, the doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum. The doctor can feel part of the prostate through the rectal wall. Swelling, lumps, firm spots, or enlargement may indicate prostate cancer.\nMost cases of prostate cancer are detected by screening for the disease with a PSA test. PSA is a protein made by the prostate that can be detected in blood. Prostate cancer can cause higher amounts of PSA to leak out of the prostate into the blood. Tell your doctor if you take any medications to treat an enlarged prostate. Certain prostate medications, such as finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart), can affect PSA test results.\nAlthough doctors use the PSA test to detect prostate cancer, it does not give a definitive diagnosis. That's because other conditions, such as an enlarged prostate, can raise PSA levels. In fact, most men with a mildly elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer. Also, some men with a normal PSA actually do have cancer.\nBecause an elevated PSA level may prompt you to seek treatment, which can cause urinary and sexual side effects, many doctors and organizations don't recommend routine PSA screening. Instead, they suggest that men age 50 and older talk with their doctors about the risks and benefits of screening. African American men should talk with their doctors about PSA screening beginning at age 40 to 45.\nEven though PSA screening is the most common way prostate cancers are detected, the test very often finds cancers that do not need to be treated. Most medical organizations recommend having a discussion with your doctor before getting the test performed on a routine basis. Discussing whether to get a PSA test with your doctor is called \"shared decision-making.\"\nIf your PSA level is high, or if your DRE shows a possible problem, your doctor may order more tests, such as an MRI or a prostate biopsy. While MRI can be helpful in diagnosing prostate cancer, most often a biopsy is still needed, although some practices will avoid doing the biopsy if the MRI test shows no signs of cancer.\nFor the biopsy, a needle is used to remove small pieces of tissue from the top, middle, and bottom parts of the prostate. Your doctor also may want to take tissue samples from any areas that felt abnormal during the DRE. A specialist called a pathologist then checks the tissue samples for cancer under a microscope.\nIf your biopsy shows prostate cancer, the pathologist will assign a Gleason grade to the two most common cells types in your tumor. The sum of the two grades is the Gleason score. The Gleason score describes how abnormal the cancer cells look compared to normal prostate cells. The score provides a rough estimate of how fast the cancer is growing and how likely it is to spread.\nA Gleason score includes the sum of two numbers that are scored as either 3, 4, or 5. The sum of the two numbers is the Gleason score.\nA more recent system assigns a Grade Group to the Gleason scores:\nA doctor will also assign a \"stage\" to your cancer. The stage describes the extent of the tumor and whether it has spread. Doctors use the Gleason score and and other studies, such as a CT scan or a bone scan and other scans, to stage and plan treatment.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once prostate cancer develops, it usually grows slowly over many years. In a small number of men, prostate cancer grows and spreads quickly. Almost all prostate cancer will respond to some type of treatment. In some cases, prostate cancer might not need treatment right away, if at all. Doctors have developed criteria to determine which cancers need treatment and which ones can be watched. If a watched tumor worsens, it can be treated.\n",
      "Prevention": "Although the evidence is mixed, men who eat a low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce their risk of prostate cancer. Older studies suggested that eating tomatoes, which contain the antioxidant lycopene, might reduce risk.\nSome medications have been tested to see if they prevent prostate cancer. These include finasteride and dutasteride, drugs normally prescribed for benign prostate enlargement. One study showed that men who took finasteride reduced their prostate cancer risk by 25 percent. But it also found that the risk of aggressive cancer went up in some men. Later studies found that the drug doesn't increase aggressive tumors. Given the contradictory findings, experts don't agree about whether to offer finasteride to men with a higher risk of prostate cancer than normal.\n",
      "Treatment": "Prostate cancer can be treated several ways. You and your doctor should weigh medical and lifestyle issues before choosing a treatment. These include\nIf your cancer is confined to the prostate gland, you have several options.\nWatchful waiting.With this approach, you don't have treatment unless you begin to have symptoms. Your doctor may monitor your cancer with DREs and PSA tests from time to time. This strategy is a good option for elderly men who are too ill for radiation or surgery, or who are likely to die from another medical condition relatively soon.\nActive surveillance.Men whose prostate cancer doesn't need treatment right away may opt for active surveillance. If you choose this approach, you will be followed more closely than with watchful waiting. Every three to six months, you will have a PSA test and a physical exam. You may also have a biopsy every year or two. If any of these show increased disease activity, you can start treatment.\nRadiation therapy.This treatment uses radiation to destroy cancer cells. Doctors can deliver radiation in two ways. The first method involves directing radiation into the body from outside the body. This is called external beam radiation therapy. Several types exist, but the goal with each is to precisely target the prostate and spare healthy tissue.\nThe second method involves putting small radioactive pellets, or seeds, into the prostate gland. Your doctor may call this brachytherapy, seed implantation, or interstitial radiation therapy. In most cases, the seeds are left in place permanently.\nYour doctor may prescribe hormone therapy to boost the effectiveness of radiation therapy. He or she may also prescribe hormone therapy to shrink the prostate before brachytherapy.\nSide effects of radiation therapy can include\nYears after radiation, there may be a slight increase in the risk of developing another type of cancer, usually in the rectum or bladder.\nSurgery.During a radical prostatectomy, the doctor will remove your prostate gland and seminal vesicles. (Seminal vesicles are glands that release fluid that becomes part of semen.) The doctor may also remove the nearby pelvic lymph nodes. During surgery, the doctor will try to do as little damage to nearby nerves as possible. This can reduce side effects such as erectile dysfunction and incontinence.\nThe doctor may use any of several techniques. For example, he or she may remove the prostate through an incision in the abdomen. Or he or she may operate laparoscopically, removing the prostate and other tissues through several tiny incisions. This is often done with the aid of a robot machine to help visualize and remove the prostate. This is called RALP (robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy). Possible complications of prostate surgery include\nThe chances of dying during or right after surgery are very low.\nCryoablation.This treatment, also called cryotherapy, kills cancer cells by freezing and then thawing them. It isn't offered at many hospitals, so finding an expert to perform the procedure in your area may be difficult. Additional research is needed to determine the long-term effects of cryoablation.\nHigh intensity focused ultrasound.This treatment destroys prostate cancer with high energy sound waves that heat cells to high temperatures. It is not currently an approved treatment for prostate cancer. Ongoing studies should help doctors determine if this procedure is safe and effective.\nIf your prostate cancer has grown through the prostate capsule but has not spread (metastasized) to other organs, watchful waiting or radiation therapy (with or without hormone therapy) are usually recommended.\nIf the cancer has spread to other organs, doctors usually prescribe hormone therapy, also called androgen-deprivation therapy. Androgens are male sex hormones, such as testosterone. Androgens can fuel prostate cancer. Hormone therapy reduces testosterone by preventing the testicles from producing it. Another approach is to surgically remove the testicles. However, few men opt for this procedure. The hormonal therapy can be combined with chemotherapy in certain circumstances, or with other drugs that block the ability of testosterone to stimulate prostate cancer growth.\nSide effects of hormone therapy include\nIf prostate cancer has already spread to other organs at the time of diagnosis, doctors may either start hormone therapy alone or some combination of androgen-deprivation therapy, chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor right away if you notice blood in your urine or semen, or if urination is painful, uncomfortable, or abnormal in any way.\nIf you are age 50 or older, ask your doctor about the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening. Some experts believe screening with PSA tests and DREs saves lives because cancer can be detected early. Others say that screening causes more harm than good. That's because some men will suffer side effects from treatment they may not have needed. Your doctor can help you decide whether screening makes sense for you, again emphasizing the concept of shared decision-making.\nIf you decide to get screened, your doctor probably will do a prostate exam and check your PSA level every one to two years, starting at age 50. If prostate cancer runs in your family, or if you are African American, screening may start at age 40 to 45.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis usually is excellent. Nearly all men diagnosed with localized cancer survive at least five years. More than three-quarters of all men diagnosed with the disease live at least 15 years. In fact, many more men die of other causes while they have prostate cancer than die as a result of the cancer.\n",

      "What is pseudogout?": "Pseudogout is a form of arthritis triggered by deposits of calcium crystals (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) in the joints. It is also called calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD). This disease can cause short-term or long-term swelling in joints, most often the knee, wrist, shoulder, ankle, or elbow.\nAs the name suggests, this condition can appear similar to gout, which is caused by another type of crystal — uric acid crystals — and commonly causes sudden pain and swelling in a single joint, usually in the foot. Pseudogout also can resemble osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.\nPseudogout is most common in the elderly. It affects about 3% of people in their 60s and as many as half of people in their 90s. Many people who get pseudogout already have joint damage from other conditions, or they may have age-related degenerative joint disease. One theory is that an injury to cartilage allows calcium crystals to be released into the joint space, and these crystals cause inflammation.\nIn some cases, other medical conditions can make people more likely to develop pseudogout. These include:\nPseudogout also can be triggered by joint injury, such as joint surgery or a sprain, or the stress of a medical illness. Frequently, however, nothing can be identified that might have triggered the disease. Although age-related joint degeneration, prior joint damage or trauma, and these other medical conditions increase the likelihood of an attack of pseudogout, the reason some people develop this condition while others do not is often unknown.\n",
      "Symptoms of pseudogout": "The most common symptoms are pain, swelling, and stiffness around a single joint, especially the knee or wrist. Occasionally, more than one joint is affected at the same time. A low-grade fever may occur during the flare.\n",
      "Diagnosing pseudogout": "Diagnosing pseudogout can be tricky because it can resemble gout, an infection, or other causes of joint inflammation. Also, pseudogout is commonly associated with other joint problems.\nX-rays may reveal calcium deposits along the affected joints, although x-rays of many healthy elderly people often show such deposits even when the person has no symptoms of pseudogout. Your doctor may recommend that joint fluid be removed from an inflamed joint. The sample will be tested for the presence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals. The sample may also need to be tested for an infection or other cause of joint inflammation.\nYour doctor may want to request tests for conditions that can trigger pseudogout. These may include tests of iron, calcium, magnesium and thyroid function.\n",
      "Expected duration of pseudogout": "Attacks of pseudogout can last for days or weeks. If the condition is not diagnosed and treated, it can cause the joint to degenerate (break down).\n",
      "Preventing pseudogout": "Treatment of a condition that increases the risk of pseudogout (such as hemochromatosis) may prevent development of the disease or repeated attacks. However, when there is no known cause or trigger, there is no way to prevent the development of pseudogout. For people with frequent attacks, taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine daily may prevent future attacks.\n",
      "Treating pseudogout": "Fluid can be removed from the joint to ease the pressure. In this procedure, called joint aspiration, a needle is inserted into the joint after the area is numbed, to withdraw fluid. Treatment usually also includes NSAIDs or injections of a medication called a glucocorticoid to keep the swelling down. These two treatments usually eliminate symptoms within hours to a few days.\nYou may also need to take oral corticosteroids for a short time. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine called colchicine or an NSAID to prevent attacks. For people with frequent attacks or chronic joint inflammation due to pseudogout despite treatments mentioned, other medications to reduce inflammation may be recommended such as hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate. If other treatments aren't effective, newer medications such as anakinra or tocilizumab may be recommended.\nOccasionally, people with recurrent or chronic pseudogout may develop degenerative joint disease. In this case, surgery (such as joint replacement) may become the only effective treatment.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience significant joint pain, especially if the joint is swollen, contact your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With treatment, the outlook for pseudogout is usually good. Joint pain and swelling usually go away promptly. It's common for attacks to return, but usually they can be controlled with repeated treatment.\n",

      "What is it?": "Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder that causes scaling and inflammation.\nPsoriasis may develop as a result of an abnormality in the body's immune system. The immune system normally fights infection and allergic reactions.\nPsoriasis probably has a genetic component. Nearly half of patients have family members with psoriasis.\nCertain medications may trigger psoriasis. Other medications seem to make psoriasis worse in people who have the disease.\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "Psoriasis causes skin scaling and inflammation. It may or may not cause itching. There are several types of psoriasis:\nAbout half of people with skin symptoms of psoriasis also have abnormal fingernails. Their nails are often thick and have small indentations, called pitting.\nA type of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis affects some people with psoriasis.

      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will look for the typical skin and nail changes of this disorder. He or she can frequently diagnose psoriasis based on your physical examination.\nWhen skin symptoms are not typical of the disorder, your doctor may recommend a skin biopsy.

      "What is it?": "Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic (long-lasting) disease in which a person with psoriasis develops the symptoms and signs of arthritis, including joint pain, stiffness and swelling. Psoriasis is a common, inherited skin condition that causes grayish-white scaling over a pink or dull-red skin rash.\nUp to 30% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis affects men and women equally and usually begins between ages 30 and 50. However, the disease can also occur in children. Symptoms can vary from mild to severe.\n",
      "Types of psoriatic arthritis": "There are five types of psoriatic arthritis. They are classified by their severity, whether both sides of the body are equally affected and which joints are involved.\nAlthough each type of psoriatic arthritis is somewhat distinct, some people show a blending of symptoms or have more than one type.\nPsoriasis can develop before or after the arthritis, but psoriasis develops first in about 75% of cases. A person may begin to get morning joint stiffness before the arthritis is recognized. People who have psoriasis that involves the nails, especially nail pitting, are much more likely to develop arthritis than those without this problem (affecting up to 50% of people with psoriasis with nail involvement).\nThe cause of psoriatic arthritis is unknown. There is some evidence that infection or trauma can play a role in the development of the disease. For example, psoriatic arthritis seems to flare up in people whose immune systems are affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\nAlso, heredity seems to play a role. Up to 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of skin or joint disease. Certain genes seem to be involved in certain types of psoriatic arthritis. For example, the gene HLA-B27 has been associated with psoriatic spondylitis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms include:\nPsoriatic arthritis can affect other parts of the body. For example, fatigue and anemia are common in people with active psoriatic arthritis. Frequently, the arthritis is accompanied by inflammation of tendons and the spots where tendons attach to bones, such as in the heel or fingers.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Usually, a doctor can diagnose psoriatic arthritis based on your symptoms and a physical examination. In contrast to lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, autoantibodies are not usually present in the blood. Your doctor may order X-rays of the affected joints, but X-rays don't always indicate what type of arthritis you have. In some cases, the X-rays may give the radiologist a clue that you have psoriatic arthritis rather than rheumatoid arthritis or another type of arthritis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Psoriatic arthritis tends to be lifelong. However, some people's symptoms vary significantly, so that it may be mild at times and more severe at other times. It's unusual for the joint problems to disappear completely.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent psoriatic arthritis.\n",
      "Treatment": "The initial treatment is usually nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Corticosteroids such as prednisone, taken by mouth, are used only occasionally, because they may cause significant side effects when taken long-term and the psoriasis tends to flare up when the drug is stopped. Occasional injections of a steroid can help when joints are severely inflamed.\nWhen the condition is more severe, drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) or methotrexate (Folex, Rheumatrex) often relieve symptoms or reduce joint inflammation. However, it is uncertain whether they protect the joints from damage. Rare reports linking hydroxychloroquine to worsening psoriasis have led some doctors to avoid this medication.\nSulfasalazine (Azulfidine), an anti-inflammatory agent used to treat inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis and leflunomide (Arava), another treatment for rheumatoid arthritis can be helpful for some people with psoriatic arthritis. Newer, injectable medicines, including adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), abatacept (Orencia), ixekizumb (Taltz), secukinumab (Cosentyx),guselkumab (Tremfya), and ustekinumab (Stelara) can be highly effective. But because they are only available by injection and are quite expensive, they are usually reserved for people with psoriatic arthritis who do not improve enough with other treatments. Several oral medications can also be effective, includuing apremilast (Otezla), tofacitinib (Xeljanz), and upadacitinib (Rinvoq).\nWhen joints deteriorate despite aggressive medical therapy, your doctor may recommend surgery to reconstruct or replace the joint, especially if the pain is localized and intense and you have difficulty functioning.\nYour doctor may recommend physical and occupational therapy to maintain muscle strength and the joint's range of motion. Splinting, a removable brace to immobilize an inflamed joint, may help reduce symptoms and inflammation. Exercise is important, especially for people with spondylitis because being active tends to reduce back symptoms.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have symptoms of psoriatic arthritis.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for people with this disease varies. For some, psoriatic arthritis is a minor annoyance that requires medication only at times when symptoms are worse. However, in up to 25% of people with psoriatic arthritis, the condition causes disability with severe, unrelenting joint damage over time. With appropriate therapy, the majority of people with psoriatic arthritis have good control of their pain, improved function and limited joint damage.\n",

      "What is it?": "Pubic lice or crab lice are tiny insects that infest a person's pubic hair, although they also can be found on facial hair, armpit hair and eyelashes. The insects look like crabs, and a person with these lice often is said to have \"crabs.\" Their claws let them grasp hairs so they can both move around and remain on their human host. Crab lice, like all lice, feed only on their host's blood. Female lice produce eggs, which are cemented to the hair shaft close to the skin. It takes about 7 to 10 days for an egg to hatch. Most people who are infested with crab lice will have about a dozen or fewer active lice on them at any one time, and the hairs may bear many live and hatched eggs.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Crab lice usually cause intense itching, due mainly to an allergic reaction to the saliva of the louse. There also may be tiny red or blue marks where the insect has been biting, and the eggs, or nits, may be seen attached to the pubic hair close to the skin. Sometimes, more severe reactions occur, such as the development of pustules or intense skin reactions where the insects have been feeding. Scratching the area may cause skin infection. Crab lice, themselves, do not transmit infections.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Diagnosing a crab lice infestation depends on finding the insects and their eggs on the hair. Because most crab louse infestations are transmitted through sexual activity, anyone who has crab lice also should be screened for other sexually transmitted diseases. Several studies have found that many people who have crab lice also will have another sexually transmitted disease. The sexual partners of someone diagnosed with crab lice should be notified and advised to be checked by a doctor.\nAlthough most crab lice infestations are transmitted through sexual contact, it is possible to get infested with the insects by sharing a bed or clothing with an affected person, and occasionally simply by other direct contacts. Crab lice can live for about 24 hours off of a human host.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Crab lice infestations usually continue until they are treated. With treatment, the infestation is usually eliminated immediately.\n",
      "Prevention": "To avoid getting crab lice, avoid sexual partners who are affected, and also avoid sharing a bed or clothing with an affected person.\n",
      "Treatment": "Crab lice infestations usually are treated by applying a creme rinse containing 1% permethrin to the pubic hair and leaving it in place for 10 minutes. Also effective are rinses containing pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide.\nPeople that fail initial treatment should consult a clinician for advice.\nNits can be removed using a fine-toothed comb after treatment. Clothing and bedding that the affected person used in the two to three days before treatment should be washed in hot water and dried in a clothes dryer on a high heat setting. If crab lice are found on the eyelashes, a doctor should be consulted to prevent injury to the eyes by the treatments.\nRecent sex partners should also be treated. Sex should not be resumed until both partners have been successfully treated.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Although products to treat crab lice infestations are available over the counter, it is a good idea to consult your health care professional if you suspect you may be infested because you also may have another sexually transmitted disease. You also should consult someone if your symptoms are especially severe, and should follow up with your health care professional to be sure the infestation has been treated successfully.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Crab lice infestations respond well to treatment and are not associated with any lasting symptoms.\n",

      "What is pyelonephritis?": "Pyelonephritis is the medical term for a kidney infection. Most often it is caused by bacteria that have traveled to the kidney from an infection in the bladder.\nBladder infections are much more common in women compared to me. That's in large part because the distance to the bladder from skin, where bacteria normally live, is quite short and direct. While most bacterial bladder infections stay in the bladder, the high incidence of female bladder infections means women will also be more prone to pyelonephritis.\nA woman is more likely to develop pyelonephritis when she is pregnant. Pyelonephritis and other forms of urinary tract infection increase the risk of premature delivery. A man is more likely to develop the problem if his prostate is enlarged, a common condition after age 50.\nBoth men and women are more likely to develop pyelonephritis if they have any of the following conditions:\nTests or procedures that involve the insertion of an instrument into the bladder also increase the risk of urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis.\nChildren sometimes develop pyelonephritis because of an abnormality in the bladder that allows urine there to flow backward (reflux) into the ureter, the connection between the kidney and bladder. This can lead to scarring of the kidney.\n",
      "Symptoms of pyelonephritis": "The two primary symptoms of pyelonephritis are pain in one flank, the area just beneath the lower ribs in the back, and fever. The pain can travel around the side toward the lower abdomen. There also can be shaking chills and nausea and vomiting. The urine may be cloudy, tinged with blood or unusually strong or foul-smelling. You may need to urinate more often than normal and urinating may be painful or uncomfortable.\n",
      "Diagnosing pyelonephritis": "If your doctor is concerned that you have a kidney infection, he or she will ask you about other medical problems, any past infections and your recent symptoms. He or she will check your vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure), and will press on your abdomen and flanks to see if there is tenderness near the kidney. In women, the symptoms of pyelonephritis may be similar to those of certain sexually transmitted diseases, so your doctor may recommend that you have a pelvic examination.\nTo diagnose pyelonephritis, your doctor will order urine tests to look for white cells in the urine and for culture to determine the type of bacteria causing the infection. Usually your doctor will also order blood tests to determine your white blood cell count and to make sure your kidney function is normal. Your doctor may also order a blood culture because some people with pyelonephritis have bacteria in their blood as well as their urine. Antibiotics are started prior to the culture results and will be adjusted once the bacterial species is identified in 24 to 48 hours.\n",
      "Expected duration of pyelonephritis": "Most patients with uncomplicated cases of pyelonephritis find that their symptoms begin to improve after one to two days of treatment with antibiotics. However, even after symptoms improve, antibiotics are usually prescribed to complete a 7 to 10 day course.\n",
      "Preventing pyelonephritis": "To help prevent pyelonephritis if you have had a previous episode or are at risk:\nIf there is a structural problem with the urinary system, such as blockage from a stone, or a developmental abnormality, surgery can be done to restore normal urinary function and prevent future episodes of pyelonephritis.\n",
      "Treating pyelonephritis": "Doctors treat pyelonephritis with antibiotics. In most uncomplicated cases of pyelonephritis, the antibiotic can be given orally (by mouth), and treatment usually lasts for 7 to 10 days. Commonly used oral antibiotics include trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim and others), ciprofloxacin (Cipro) or levofloxacin (Levaquin), but the choice of antibiotic will depend on your history of allergies and laboratory testing of the bacteria causing the infection.\nIf you have high fever, shaking chills or severe nausea and vomiting, you are more likely to become dehydrated and may be unable to take oral antibiotics. In that case, you may require hospital treatment so that antibiotics can be given intravenously (into a vein). High fever and shaking chills also may be signs that your kidney infection has spread to your bloodstream and can travel to others parts of your body. If your doctor is concerned that you may have an obstruction (such as a kidney stone that is stuck in the ureter) or a structural abnormality in your urinary system, other tests may be ordered, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you have symptoms of pyelonephritis (particularly fever and flank pain, with or without urinary symptoms), especially if you are pregnant.\n",
      "Prognosis": "A single episode of uncomplicated pyelonephritis rarely causes permanent kidney damage in an otherwise healthy adult. However, repeated episodes of pyelonephritis can cause chronic (long-lasting) kidney disease in children, people with diabetes, and adults who have structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, or nerve diseases that disrupt bladder function. Pyelonephritis can become chronic if an infection cannot be cleared easily, as in a person with a kidney stone or a developmental abnormality of the urinary system.\n",

      "What Is It?": "A rash is a temporary eruption or discoloration of the skin and is often inflamed or swollen. Rashes come in many forms and levels of severity, and they last for different amounts of time. Some common causes of rashes include the following.\nThis broad category covers a wide range of illnesses, including:\n\n\nFungal infections, such as jock itch (a fungal infection in the groin region)\nMany others\nThese can be triggered by:\nInsect stings (including bees, wasps and hornets)\nThis category includes diaper rash (caused by prolonged skin contact with urine and stool) and rashes caused by contact with harsh chemicals, such as laundry soaps and fabric softeners.\n\nPoison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac share a highly allergenic sap resin that can cause allergic rashes in 70% of people exposed to it.\n\nThis category includes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), dermatomyositis and scleroderma, disorders in which the body's immune defenses mistakenly attack healthy areas of the body, including the skin.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Although rash is easily recognized, all rashes are not the same. Rashes vary in their appearance, timing, location or distribution, and duration. In general, rashes can be described as:\nAdditional signs and symptoms that sometimes accompany rashes include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about your medical history, including your history of allergies and your work history, to check for possible exposure to chemical irritants or to people with infections. Your doctor also may ask specific questions about your rash, including:\nYour doctor may suspect a specific cause based on your medical history and the history of your rash. Your doctor will try to confirm this suspicion by examining the rash's appearance, location, pattern and any associated symptoms. In many cases, the results of your physical examination will clarify the diagnosis, and no further tests will be needed.\nWhen required, additional testing may include:\n",
      "Expected Duration": "How long a rash lasts depends on its cause. However, most rashes usually disappear within a few days. For example, the rash of a roseola viral infection usually lasts 1 to 2 days, whereas the rash of measles disappears within 6 to 7 days. Rashes caused by an antibiotic allergy may last 3 to 14 days, whereas diaper rash almost always clears up within 1 week (if diapers are changed frequently).\nRashes resulting from lupus or dermatomyositis may last for an extended period of time.\n",
      "Prevention": "Prevention depends on the cause of the rash:\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cause of the rash:\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Seek immediate medical attention if you begin to have difficulty breathing or develop hives, a fever, a fast pulse, confusion or nausea. These could be signs of a life-threatening allergic reaction.\nAlways consult your doctor promptly if a rash:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for most rashes is excellent, especially after the cause has been identified accurately.\nIn severe allergic reactions, a patient can die within minutes without immediate medical treatment. With proper treatment, recovery usually is complete. However, the patient remains at risk of future severe reactions if he or she is exposed to the same allergy-producing agent. For this reason, a prescription for a self-injection pen containing epinephrine for emergencies usually is recommended for people with severe allergies.\nFor long-term autoimmune conditions, rash is only one of a wide variety of symptoms. The prognosis depends on the type and severity of the autoimmune disease.\n",

      "What is Raynaud's phenomenon?": "Raynaud's phenomenon is a blood vessel disorder. The condition is also called Raynaud's disease or Raynaud's syndrome.\nWhen healthy people are in a cold environment, the tiny blood vessels in their skin constrict, or narrow. This is an effort by the body to conserve heat.\nIn people with Raynaud's phenomenon, that natural response to cold is exaggerated. The tiny blood vessels go into spasm, narrowing and reducing the blood flow to the affected areas. This response, called vasospasm, is seen most often in the fingers and toes. But it also can occur in the ears, cheeks and nose.\nIn some people, the constriction also can occur in response to emotional stress or a rapid change of temperature from warm to cool. Or, it may occur for no apparent reason.\nThe effect of this vasospasm can be dramatic and frightening. But it is temporary and rarely dangerous. Once the affected area is warmed, the blood vessels relax and expand. This allows more blood flow.\nNo one knows what causes Raynaud's phenomenon. People who do not have any other symptoms or disease are said to have primary Raynaud's. People who have Raynaud's as part of another disease are said to have secondary Raynaud's.\nSecondary Raynaud's is commonly linked to connective-tissue disorders, such as scleroderma and lupus. It also can result from blood vessel damage due to injury, frostbite or use of jarring machinery, such as jackhammers or chainsaws.\nOther causes of secondary Raynaud's include:\nThese factors can also worsen pre-existing Raynaud's.\n",
      "Symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon": "People with Raynaud's see and feel changes in their fingers and toes when exposed to cold. The skin blanches, or turns white, then blue. Fingers and toes can tingle or feel numb.\nWhen rewarmed, the skin flushes pink or red. And there can be throbbing or soreness as the blood surges back into the tiny blood vessels.\nPeople with secondary Raynaud's often have symptoms related to their underlying rheumatic disease such as\n",
      "Diagnosing Raynaud's phenomenon": "A physician usually diagnoses Raynaud's based on the patient's description of symptoms.\nIf other symptoms also are present, blood tests and other procedures may be done to check for other diseases.\nMore testing also is needed if symptoms are not typical, such as:\nThese atypical symptoms would be unusual for Raynaud's. They could indicate another problem with circulation.\nCareful examination of the nail beds (the skin near the fingernail farthest from the fingertip) may show changes in the blood vessels. These changes may suggest an underlying rheumatic condition such as scleroderma.\n",
      "Expected duration of Raynaud's phenomenon": "Each episode of vasospasm is temporary. However, Raynaud's is considered a chronic (long-lasting) condition.\n",
      "Preventing Raynaud's phenomenon": "There is no way to prevent a person from developing Raynaud's. But once the disorder is present, the number of episodes of vasospasm can be reduced or even eliminated. To do so, avoid situations that can trigger events.\nTo avoid vasospasm:\n",
      "Treating Raynaud's phenomenon": "Most people with primary Raynaud's disease do not need specific treatment. Their symptoms can be managed by avoiding triggering events as much as possible.\nAn episode of vasospasm often can be stopped by warming the affected areas. Do this by going indoors or soaking fingers or toes in a bowl of warm (not hot) water.\nBiofeedback can help people train the body to warm the extremities. This mind-body method may help you to learn how to gain voluntary control over body processes that are typically involuntary, such as blood flow. It can help some patients to control their symptoms.\nFor more severe cases (which are more common with secondary Raynaud's), medication may be prescribed to reduce the severity and number of vasospasm episodes. These include:\nIn severe cases that do not respond to the above treatments, your doctor may recommend intravenous medications, such as prostacyclin or iloprost. Rarely, your doctor may discuss a surgical procedure to interrupt the nerves that control blood vessel constriction. This procedure is called a sympathectomy.\nPeople with secondary Raynaud's will need to be treated for their underlying disease.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your health care professional if you have symptoms of Raynaud's. Your doctor will tell you more about Raynaud's and will diagnose or rule out associated diseases.\nIf you have been diagnosed with Raynaud's, see your doctor if you have any unusual symptoms. These include severe redness, inflammation or open sores.\nSeek emergency care if you have\n",
      "Prognosis": "For most people, primary Raynaud's can be annoying and cause discomfort, but is rarely dangerous. Although it is typically a lifelong condition, it frequently does not get worse. In cases in which the vasospasm is severe, the affected areas may be prone to open sores that are slow to heal.\nRaynaud's phenomenon, however, may be the first symptom of a rheumatic disease. So the condition should not be ignored. Patients may need to be examined, tested and monitored to diagnose an associated rheumatic disease at its earliest stage.\n",

      "What is it?": "Reactive arthritis is an uncommon disease that causes inflammation of the joints and, in many cases, other areas, particularly the urinary tract and eyes. It is triggered by an infection, usually by a sexually transmitted organism or by certain gastrointestinal bacteria.\nThe most common infection causing reactive arthritis is the sexually transmitted disease (STD) chlamydia. Reactive arthritis can also be caused by gastrointestinal infection from bacteria such as salmonella, shigella, campylobacter or Yersinia, infections that can cause diarrhea and vomiting. These bacteria often are found in contaminated food or water. While these infections are common, reactive arthritis is not. Scientists believe that people who develop reactive arthritis have a certain genetic makeup. Supporting the theory that genetic makeup is a risk factor, about 50% of people with reactive arthritis carry a gene called HLA-B27, compared with 8% of the general population.\nReactive arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. In this case, the immune system is jolted into action by the infection but continues attacking after the infection is gone.\nReactive arthritis typically includes arthritis, eye inflammation (conjunctivitis or uveitis) and inflammation of the urethra (urethritis). However, some people develop only one or two of these. Reactive arthritis is most common in people between the ages of 20 and 40, with a prevalence of about 0.03% (30 per 100,000).\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms usually appear within a few weeks after someone has had chlamydia or a diarrheal infection. Most people feel a little tired and have a slight fever, although a few have high fever, significant fatigue and weight loss. Other early symptoms include muscle aches, joint stiffness, and low back pain radiating into the buttocks or thighs. Back discomfort usually gets worse when you sit or lie still and gets better when you move around. Arthritis begins abruptly and usually affects one or several joints, especially the knees, ankles, feet or wrists. People often have pain at the back of an ankle or tenderness on the bottom of a heel (from inflammation at the spot where a tendon attaches to a bone).\nSymptoms vary depending on what other areas of the body are inflamed:\nOther symptoms are rarer, including inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), bladder (cystitis) or heart lining (pericarditis) and leaking of the aortic valve.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A doctor may suspect you have reactive arthritis when the typical symptoms develop after you had an infection. Your doctor will examine you and will order imaging tests, such as X-rays of the pelvis or lower spine. Your doctor may remove fluid from a painful joint with a needle so it can be examined in a laboratory. Fluid from an inflamed joint will contain a high number of white blood cells but there is no detectable infection in the joint.\nThere is no single test that can confirm the diagnosis. Your doctor will diagnose reactive arthritis based on your history of infection, your symptoms and the physical exam. Tests may be done to check for other conditions that can cause joint inflammation, such as an infection or gout.\n",
      "Expected duration": "For reasons that are not yet known, reactive arthritis sometimes gets better on its own over a number of months or years. However, it is often chronic (long-lasting) and treatment may be needed long-term, even for a lifetime.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent reactive arthritis, but the infections that may trigger it can be prevented. You can help to prevent gastrointestinal infections by properly cooking food and washing your hands thoroughly after contact with animals and before preparing food. You can reduce the risk of STDs by practicing safe sex.\n",
      "Treatment": "The choice of treatment for reactive arthritis depends on your specific symptoms. If you still have the infection, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics, usually for seven to 10 days. Some physicians treat chlamydia infections with antibiotics for as long as three months. A limited number of studies have shown that this longer treatment helps to prevent reactive arthritis, but prolonged antibiotic treatment remains controversial. The sexual partners of a person with newly diagnosed chlamydia should also be treated.\nFor mild arthritis, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with or without a pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brand names), may be enough. For more severe arthritis, injections of corticosteroids into the inflamed joint can relieve pain, although the relief is often temporary. Other medications that may be helpful include those used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, such as corticosteroids, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate (all available as generics). Injectable medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis may also be used, including adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), or infliximab (Remicade). Surgery to replace a joint may help severe arthritis that does not respond to medications.\nIt's important to balance rest and exercise. Biking and swimming, for example, can help to reduce stiffness and keep the joint moving. Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist, occupational therapist or podiatrist. Splints, shoe inserts or braces can provide relief in ways that medications cannot.\nFor the other manifestations of disease, treatment options include:\nThe care of people with reactive arthritis should be coordinated by their primary care physician with regular monitoring by appropriate specialists, which may include a dermatologist, ophthalmologist, rheumatologist or urologist.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have symptoms of reactive arthritis such as joint pain, swelling, limited motion, red or painful eyes, or painful urination. If you notice pain or burning with urination, or a discharge from the penis or vagina, call your doctor right away. Let your doctor know if you have diarrhea that is persistent, bloody or associated with pain.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With therapy, the outlook for reactive arthritis is good, although the condition is quite variable. Severe cases may be associated with significant joint damage, vision problems and other disabling manifestations, whereas other cases are much milder and only intermittently bothersome. Risk factors for more severe disease include one or more of the following:\n",

      "What is it?": "In women, the vagina is separated from the rectum by a firm wall of tough, fibrous tissue called fascia. Sometimes, an area of this wall gets weak, and part of the rectum bulges into the vagina. This bulge is called a rectocele.\nThe problem usually develops after the wall is damaged during a vaginal delivery. The bulge may occur after a vaginal delivery, but symptoms may not develop until later in life. Rectoceles are more commonly seen in older women who have entered menopause.\nSome conditions can increase the risk of developing rectocele, including chronic constipation, chronic cough, repetitive heavy lifting, or any activity that puts pressure on the pelvic floor over time.\nBecause small rectoceles often do not cause any symptoms, it is difficult for health experts to determine exactly how often they occur. As few as 20%, or as many as 80% of adult women may be affected, but rectoceles are most commonly seen in older women who have had multiple vaginal deliveries. In one recent study of 125 women in the United States who had rectoceles, the typical patient was about 60 years old, going through menopause, and had gone through two or three vaginal deliveries. A woman with a rectocele is also likely to have related conditions, including a cystocele (an abnormal bulging of the bladder through a weakness in the anterior vaginal wall) and uterine prolapse (abnormal sagging of the uterus into the vagina because of loss of its pelvic support).\n",
      "Symptoms": "A small rectocele may not cause any symptoms, especially if it bulges less than 2 centimeters (less than 1 inch) into the vagina. However, larger rectoceles can trigger a variety of rectal and vaginal complaints, including\nIn some cases, the patient must use a technique called manual evacuation or digitation to help empty the rectum. In this technique, the patient presses on the rectocele with her fingers while defecating to help the stool to pass.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about the number of times that you've had a vaginal delivery, and about any problems, such as vaginal tears, you may have had with your deliveries. After reviewing your rectal and vaginal symptoms, your doctor also may ask about any urinary problems that suggest that you might have a cystocele as well as a rectocele.\nIn most cases, your doctor can confirm that you have a rectocele by doing a gynecological and a rectal examination. As you doctor examines you, he or she may ask you to strain or bear down as if you were trying to defecate. This straining maneuver should cause the rectocele to bulge, and allow the doctor to see the rectocele's size and location inside your vagina. At some medical centers, imaging tests of the rectum may be done to outline the size and location of the rectocele.\n",
      "Expected duration": "A rectocele is a long-term condition that does not heal on its own. It may remain a minor problem or become larger and more problematic with time.\n",
      "Prevention": "Some health experts believe that Kegel exercises can either help to prevent a rectocele or relieve some of its symptoms. Kegel exercises are muscle-strengthening maneuvers that help to tighten the tissues around the vagina, but they have not been proven to prevent rectoceles.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you are troubled by symptoms of a rectocele, you doctor likely will do surgery to repair the weakness in the fascia between your rectum and vagina. This repair may be done by reinforcing the area with stitches, or it may involve more complex techniques, such as placing a mesh patch to strengthen and support the wall between the rectum and vagina. If you also have a cystocele or uterine prolapse, then surgery to repair these conditions usually can be done at the same time as your rectocele repair.\nA nonsurgical treatment called a vaginal pessary is available as an alternative. A pessary is a device shaped like a ring, block, or plug that is placed into the vagina to support the bulging tissues. Several types of pessaries are in use, some that you may be able to remove and clean daily, others that may require a doctor's visit for periodic removal and cleaning. Your doctor will decide which type of pessary is best for you, and will make sure it fits properly.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly if you discover an abnormal bulge in the wall of your vagina, or if you suddenly develop severe rectal pressure, pain, or bleeding.\nCall your doctor for an appointment if you suffer from chronic constipation, pain, or discomfort during sexual intercourse, or any difficulty passing stool.\n",
      "Prognosis": "When surgery is used to treat rectoceles, the structural problem can be repaired successfully in the majority of cases. Most patients experienced improvement or complete relief of their symptoms.\n",

      "What is respiratory syncytial virus?": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the many viruses that cause the common cold and infections in the upper parts of the respiratory tract. RSV also can cause infection in the lower respiratory tract, such as pneumonia in the lung tissue and bronchiolitis inside the smallest airways (bronchioles) in the lungs.\nRSV is spread in secretions when someone with it coughs or sneezes. RSV also can be carried on unwashed hands and on contaminated objects such as dirty tissues, doorknobs, and desk tops. It typically enters the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth when someone with contaminated fingers touches his or her face or eyes or breathes in droplets.\nPeople who have the greatest risk of serious illness from RSV include:\nThe highest rates of serious childhood RSV illness occur in infants under 8 months old. Almost all children have been exposed to RSV by the age of 2. Most do not become dangerously ill. Getting RSV more than once can happen, but infections that follow the first one generally are mild.\n",
      "Symptoms of RSV": "RSV tends to cause typical cold symptoms, including:\nIn general, the symptoms caused by RSV tend to be more severe than the average common cold. Symptoms generally begin within a week after an exposure to someone with an RSV infection.\nIn infants and children younger than age 3, or older children with underlying lung, heart, or immune problems, RSV may start out looking like a mild cold with sneezing and runny nose. After two or three days, RSV can spread into the chest, causing a cough, breathing that is faster than normal, and wheezing. Babies who were born prematurely, or those with lung problems, congenital heart disease, or problems with their immune systems, have a higher chance of getting a serious RSV infection.\nYoung children also can have a high fever. Infants with breathing difficulties may grunt, flare the nostrils, or have \"retractions,\" which means the chest muscles are drawn in so that the ribs can be seen as the baby struggles to breathe.\n",
      "Diagnosing RSV": "Your doctor may suspect an RSV infection based on the symptoms and a physical examination during certain times of the year when RSV is most common. In most adults and older children, further testing is unnecessary because RSV symptoms generally are mild, and the illness usually is treated at home.\nWhen examining infants and children younger than age 3, or children with underlying lung, heart, or immune problems, the doctor will check for fever, cough, nasal discharge that may interfere with feeding, the chest drawing in, wheezing, breathing quickly, and a bluish color to the lips and fingernails. If your child's symptoms are severe or not as expected, the doctor may want to confirm the diagnosis of RSV infection by taking a sample of nose or throat secretions to test for the virus in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration of RSV": "In people who are basically healthy, RSV infection typically lasts about one to two weeks. However, the wheezing that is caused by RSV can last a month or longer.\n",
      "Preventing RSV": "Preventing RSV is difficult because the virus is highly contagious and is spread easily from person to person. The best way to prevent RSV infection is to wash hands regularly, especially when someone in the family has cold symptoms. Adults and older children should always wash their hands frequently, avoid touching their face and eyes unnecessarily, and stay away from direct contact with people who have obvious cold symptoms. Young infants should be kept away from anyone who has symptoms of a respiratory infection, even if it's just a slight cold.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that infants less than 8 months old receive one dose of nirsevimab during the peak RSV season, unless the mother received RSV vaccination. Infants older than 8 months who are at risk of severe infection may be offered a second dose. Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody given by injection.\nVaccination against RSV is available for adults 60 years and older. The vaccine helps prevent severe symptoms and hospitalization secondary to RSV pneumonia. Older adults with significant heart or lung disease or who have compromised immune systems will benefit most from the vaccine.\n",
      "Treating RSV": "For mild RSV infections, treatment is aimed at making the person comfortable. Treatment may include:\nInfants and younger children with severe RSV infection may need to be hospitalized. In the hospital, the infant or child may receive oxygen, fluids (by vein), and medications to help him or her breathe easier. Certain patients with weakened immune systems may be given a medication called ribavirin.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if your infant or younger child has:\nIf you have a premature infant or one with serious respiratory or other health problems, speak to your doctor about your baby's need for preventive medicines from late fall through early spring.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most RSV infections go away completely with no lasting effects. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment, most infants and children recover from serious respiratory illnesses caused by RSV infections. Deaths from RSV infections are relatively rare, but RSV infection can cause death in high-risk infants ages 2 months to 8 months, and in older infants and older adults with certain chronic diseases or who have immune system problems.\nChildren who have RSV bronchiolitis in infancy have a slightly higher risk of having recurrent wheezing as they get older. It's not known if RSV causes this, or whether children who are at higher risk of asthma are more likely to become ill with RSV exposure during infancy.\n",

      "What is it?": "Restless legs syndrome is a movement disorder that causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs. These sensations typically are worse during periods of rest, especially just before sleeping at night, but they may happen during daytime periods of inactivity, such as watching a movie, attending a long business meeting, or flying in a plane.\nThe discomfort of restless legs syndrome usually is accompanied by an overwhelming urge to move the legs, which may relieve leg discomfort temporarily. At night, people with restless legs syndrome often find that their leg symptoms make it difficult to fall asleep. Because of this, insomnia is common, together with extreme drowsiness and fatigue during the daytime.\nThe cause of restless legs syndrome remains unknown. However, evidence suggests that there is a problem related to a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. Since restless legs syndrome may affect family members across generations, scientists suspect that there is some genetic (inherited) risk of the problem. In addition, genetic studies find an association between certain genes and restless legs syndrome. Still, a definite genetic cause has not been confirmed.\nIn some people with restless legs syndrome, anemia due to iron deficiency may be a contributing factor, while in others restless legs syndrome has been linked to pregnancy, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, varicose veins, or peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet). High caffeine intake (coffee, tea, cola beverages, chocolate) and some vitamin deficiencies also may be related to restless legs syndrome.\nAlthough restless legs syndrome tends to be more common and more severe in people over age 50, it can occur in men and women of any age group, even in young people who may be misdiagnosed as hyperactive. Currently, tens of thousands of people in the United States have restless legs syndrome that is severe enough to disrupt normal daily life. However, researchers estimate that even more people — possibly up to 3% to 8% of the U.S. population — may have occasional, milder symptoms of restless legs syndrome.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Restless legs syndrome causes a wide range of uncomfortable leg sensations, which may be described as any of the following: tingling, prickly, wormy, boring, crawling, pulling, drawing, and sometimes pain. Although the muscles of the lower legs are affected most often, restless legs syndrome occasionally can cause symptoms in the arms as well. The discomfort of restless legs syndrome is almost always accompanied by an irresistible need to move the legs. Leg movement, such as walking, stretching and deep knee bends, seems to bring temporary relief. A leg massage or a warm bath also may help.\nIn addition to leg discomfort, restless legs syndrome also can cause periodic jerking leg movements during sleep. These involuntary leg movements often disturb both the patient and the patient's bed partner. Also, because symptoms of restless legs syndrome tend to be worse at bedtime, people with restless legs syndrome may find it hard to fall asleep and to stay asleep. This can cause insomnia and severe daytime drowsiness that may interfere significantly with work, school and social life.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will diagnose restless legs syndrome based on your symptoms, medical history, family history, and a physical examination. Your doctor also will do a neurological examination to look for nerve damage. He or she may order routine blood tests to check for anemia, iron or vitamin deficiency, diabetes, and kidney problems. If the body's stores of iron are low, iron supplements may relieve the restless legs syndrome symptoms.\nMany people with restless legs syndrome also have involuntary, periodic, jerking leg movements during sleep. The movements occur one to 10 times per minute. A sleep study can determine how much this is happening and how it is affecting your sleep. In some cases, an overnight sleep study at a sleep clinic may be necessary.\n",
      "Expected duration": "In women who first develop restless legs syndrome during pregnancy, symptoms often disappear after delivery. In other people with restless legs syndrome, the disorder may be a lifelong problem.\n",
      "Prevention": "Although there is no way to prevent restless legs syndrome, it may help to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and cigarette smoking.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment of restless legs syndrome depends on the severity of your symptoms. If your symptoms are mild, simply exercising, stretching, massaging your legs, or taking a hot bath may bring relief. Lifestyle changes also may help, especially following a balanced diet and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and cigarette smoking.\nIron treatment may be helpful even in the absence of iron deficiency (because too much iron can be harmful, monitoring of blood iron levels is important).\nMany experts also recommend mentally challenging activities, such as crossword puzzles or video games, to reduce symptoms (perhaps by distraction).\nA number of medications, taken individually or in combination, may be effective to treat restless legs syndrome. Drugs called alpha-2-delta ligands are recommended as the first choice. They include gabapentin (Neurontin), gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant), and pregabalin (Lyrica). Examples of other drugs that may be useful are clonidine (Catapres), amantadine (Symadine, Symmetrel), and propranolol (Inderal).\nA vibrating pad is a nonmedication treatment for restless legs syndrome. Some studies suggest this treatment can be helpful, but not all experts are convinced of its effectiveness. It is generally well tolerated, but it occasionally causes a temporary worsening of symptoms, leg cramps, soreness, and motion sickness.\nMany people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), a common movement disorder that causes involuntary, periodic, jerking leg movements during sleep. The movements occur one to 10 times per minute. The degree of periodic limb movement and how it affects sleep is best assessed with a sleep study (polysomnogram).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have long-lasting, unexplained discomfort in any part of your body, especially if this discomfort prevents you from sleeping normally.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Symptoms of restless legs syndrome often become more severe with age, although the disorder tends to come and go. In some cases, treatment with medications or avoiding caffeine can dramatically decrease restless legs syndrome symptoms.\n",

      "What is it?": "The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that is responsible for vision. Blood circulation to most of the retina's surface is primarily through one artery and one vein. If either blood vessel or one of their smaller branches is blocked, blood circulation to the retina can be significantly disrupted. The blockage is called an occlusion.\nIf a main vessel becomes occluded, the eye typically loses vision, often suddenly. If blockage occurs in a smaller branch vessel, there may be partial vision loss or no symptoms. The condition is often painless.\n",
      "Retinal artery occlusion": "Retinal artery occlusion is a medical emergency. Treatment focuses on increasing blood flow to the retina as soon as possible. However, none of the therapies have proven to be best and results are frequently disappointing. Options include:\nWhen retinal artery occlusion is caused by temporal arteritis, doctors prescribe high dose corticosteroids with or without other immunosuppressant medications (such as tocilizumab). The corticosteroid dose is gradually tapered over many months.\n",
      "Retinal vein occlusion": "In many cases, no urgent treatment is needed and the condition can be monitored carefully. Treatment is focused on stopping both macular edema and over growth of small blood vessels in the retina called neovascularization. The usual treatment is a series of injections of an anti-VEGF (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor), such as ranibizumab or aflibercept, into the eye. Corticosteroids (by injection into the eye or as a drug-containing implant) can be effective as well. Blood thinners are occasionally recommended, such as when a condition causing excessive clotting is discovered. Surgery, including removal of the fluid within the eye, may be recommended for complications of retinal vein occlusion, such as persistent bleeding.\nWhen only a small branch of the central retinal vein is blocked, sealing around the damaged area with a laser (laser photocoagulation) may improve vision.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The usual symptom of retinal artery occlusion is a sudden, painless, persistent, substantial loss of vision in one eye. In about 10% of those affected, this loss of vision is preceded by one or more episodes of a condition called amaurosis fugax. Amaurosis fugax is a temporary episode of decreased vision, usually lasting no more than 10 to 15 minutes, that is sometimes described as \"closing a curtain\" on one eye.\nAlthough retinal vein occlusion also causes painless loss of vision, this vision loss sometimes develops gradually over several days or weeks rather than suddenly. Also, depending on the extent of retinal damage, some people have only minimal blurring of vision, while others have more substantial vision loss.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "After reviewing your symptoms, the doctor will ask questions about your medical history, especially any history of high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, glaucoma, eye trauma or amaurosis fugax. Next, your doctor will do a thorough eye examination, including tests of your visual acuity (how well you can see) and peripheral vision. Your doctor will use special eyedrops to dilate (open wide) your pupils to examine the inside of your eye, including the retina.\nDuring this examination, the doctor will use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope or a slit lamp to see whether your retina's blood supply appears to be normal, or whether there are areas of whiteness (a sign of arterial occlusion), hemorrhage, a visible embolus lodged in a retinal vessel, or other problems. In some cases, the doctor also may order fluorescein angiography, a test that uses an injected dye to analyze blood flow in the eye.\nIn some people, especially those who are elderly, retinal artery occlusion may be caused by temporal arteritis, a form of blood vessel inflammation, rather than to a thrombus or embolus. Doctors order blood tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein to help make this diagnosis but an ultrasound or biopsy may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.\nIn addition, if the doctor suspects that your eye problem is being caused by emboli from undiagnosed cardiovascular illness, you may need diagnostic tests to evaluate the blood flow in your heart and carotid arteries. Also, blood tests may be necessary to determine your cholesterol levels or to check for blood clotting disorders, especially in young people.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Whenever the retina's arterial circulation is blocked, loss of vision may be permanent if the blockage is not resolved within 24 hours. Treatments for retinal arterial blockage are limited. There are more available options when the vein is blocked but even these therapies are often unsatisfactory.\n",
      "Prevention": "Since many cases of retinal vessel occlusion are related to high blood pressure, atherosclerosis or diabetes, it may be possible to prevent this eye problem by not smoking and controlling your blood pressure, cholesterol level and blood sugar. Also, people with diabetes should have a thorough eye examination through dilated pupils at least once a year.\nTo help prevent retinal artery occlusion related to traumatic eye injuries, always wear appropriate protective eye gear (goggles, face shield, face mask) at work and while playing sports. Also, remember to use a seat belt whenever you ride in a car to prevent your face and eyes from hitting the dashboard during a collision.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the type of occlusion.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience a sudden loss of vision, seek emergency medical help immediately. Prompt treatment provides the best chance at restoring vision, particularly when the retina's artery is blocked.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If the entire retinal artery has been blocked, the outlook for restoring vision is usually poor, especially if symptoms have lasted longer than a few hours. If only a small branch of the artery is blocked, however, the prognosis is often very good.\nThe situation is similar for retinal vein occlusions. Blockage of the entire vein has a poorer prognosis than blockage of only one small branch. However, the outlook has become a bit more favorable with the use of anti-VEGF injections. Laser treatments sometimes produce dramatic improvements in vision in people with small branch vein occlusions.\n",

      "What is it?": "Retinopathy means that disease has damaged the retina. The retina is the part inside the eye that senses light. Different diseases can cause retinopathy. There can be partial or complete loss of vision. Retinopathy can develop slowly or suddenly, can get better on its own or lead to permanent damage.\n\nThe retina contains many blood vessels. Abnormalities in these vessels are a major cause of retinopathy.\nThere are several types of retinopathy, including:\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "Retinopathy of prematurity — There are no outward physical signs. Only an experienced ophthalmologist can find signs of this illness.\nDiabetic retinopathy— Symptoms may not be noticed until the late stages of the illness. Symptoms can include:\nHypertensive retinopathy— There are often no symptoms. Some people complain of blurred vision.\nCentral serous retinopathy— Symptoms include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Retinopathy of prematurity— An ophthalmologist examines the inside of the eye for abnormalities.\nDiabetic retinopathy— An ophthalmologist examines the retina and inside of the eye. He or she uses a lighted instrument called an ophthalmoscope. A dye may be used to reveal leaky blood vessels.\nHypertensive retinopathy— A physician examines the eye with an ophthalmoscope. He or she looks for pale or white areas of the retina. These areas are pale because they are not getting enough blood. The doctor also may see bleeding from ruptured blood vessels or swelling of the retina or optic nerve.\nCentral serous retinopathy— A doctor or ophthalmologist uses an ophthalmoscope to detect fluid between layers of the retina. This fluid can resemble bubbles.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Retinopathy of prematurity— In most affected babies, this condition gets better on its own. Abnormal vessels disappear. A small number of more serious cases get worse without treatment. Babies who need treatment are treated in the first few months of life. It is usually possible to know within months whether there is any significant long-term damage to vision.\nDiabetic retinopathy— Controlling blood sugar and blood pressure can help delay and maybe even prevent the onset of the disease. Treatments can repair existing damage.\nHypertensive retinopathy— Lowering blood pressure often can stop ongoing damage to the retina. However, some existing damage can persist.\nCentral serous retinopathy— Most cases go away without any treatment within three to four months. Full vision can return within six months.\n",
      "Prevention": "Retinopathy of prematurity— The first line of defense is regular prenatal care. This helps to prevent premature birth. Premature and low-birth-weight infants should be screened for retinopathy of prematurity if they:\nROP can be caused by or get worse from inadequate or too much oxygen after birth. Therefore, oxygen levels are closely monitored and adjusted.\nDiabetic retinopathy— Controlling blood sugar and blood pressure are essential to prevent diabetic retinopathy.\nAnnual eye exams are crucial for people with diabetes. If you have diabetic retinopathy, you should have more frequent eye exams. Treatment can start before sight is affected, which helps prevent vision loss.\nHypertensive retinopathy— Avoid high blood pressure by:\nCentral serous retinopathy— The possible causes of this disease are not understood. Therefore, prevention is difficult. Because central serous retinopathy has been associated with corticosteroid treatment, high blood pressure and caffeine use,  limiting the amount of corticosteroids and caffeine and maintaining a normal blood pressure are important measures.\n",
      "Treatment": "Retinopathy of prematurity— No treatment is recommended during the early, milder stages. However, close monitoring is essential. An ophthalmologist should examine high-risk infants before they are discharged from the hospital. Infants should be examined again at 8 weeks of age. If the disease is active, the infant should be examined every 1 to 2 weeks until he or she is 14 weeks old. After that, they should be examined every 1 to 2 months. More advanced disease may require treatment. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (including bevacizumab, and ranibizumab) can be injected into the eye as the initial treatment.  Laser treatments may also be used. A detached retina can be reattached.  An older procedure called cryotherapy uses cold to destroy abnormal blood vessels and may be used when laser treatment is not available.\nDiabetic retinopathy— No therapy may be needed for mild nonproliferative disease.  Otherwise, specific treatment depends on the nature and severity of disease, preferences of the patient and cost. Treatment options include:\n\nLaser photocoagulation is usually done in a doctor's office. The ophthalmologist uses a laser to make a series of tiny burns around the retinal tear. This creates a barrier of scar tissue that stops the tear from getting bigger.\nFor all type of diabetic retinopathy, blood sugar and blood pressure must be controlled to keep the eye disease from getting worse.\nHypertensive retinopathy— Medications can lower blood pressure. This can lead to improvements in the retina. People with very high blood pressure and swelling of the optic nerve require emergency treatment in a hospital.\nCentral serous retinopathy— This condition usually goes away on its own.  If corticosteroid therapy can be safely reduced and discontinued, this may hasten recovery.   An ophthalmologist should monitor you closely for three to six months. If the condition does not improve, laser treatment may speed healing.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call a doctor if you notice changes in your vision, particularly if they are sudden. Changes may include:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis depends on what's causing the retinopathy, and how far it has progressed.\nRetinopathy of prematurity— In most affected babies, this condition gets better on its own. Abnormal vessels disappear. However, more advanced cases can lead to a number of eye problems, including blindness.\nChildren with retinopathy of prematurity have an increased risk of:\nDiabetic retinopathy— The outlook depends on:\nTreatments can repair damage and slow the progress of the disease. Advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy can lead to blindness.\nHypertensive retinopathy— Most changes in the retina caused by hypertensive retinopathy disappear after blood pressure has been lowered. Some signs of damage can remain.\nCentral serous retinopathy— Most cases go away on their own within three to four months. Full visual acuity usually returns within six months. Lasting symptoms can include:\nFor persistent disease, laser treatment or photodynamic therapy (a treatment using light and a chemical substance that makes certain cells sensitive to light) may be offered. Central serous retinopathy recurs in about half of affected people.\n",

      "What is retrobulbar neuritis?": "Retrobulbar neuritis is a form of optic neuritis in which the optic nerve, which is at the back of the eye, becomes inflamed. The inflamed area is between the back of the eye and the brain. The optic nerve contains fibers that carry visual information from the nerve cells in the retina to the nerve cells in the brain. When these fibers become inflamed, visual signaling to the brain becomes disrupted and vision is impaired.\nRetrobulbar neuritis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including:\nHowever, in many cases the cause is unknown. Vision loss can be minimal, or the disease can result in complete blindness.\nOptic neuritis affects women twice as often as men, and usually affects adults between the ages of 20 and 40.\nThe vast majority also have pain when they move their eyes. Retrobulbar neuritis often is an early sign that someone has multiple sclerosis. Between 20% and 40% of the 20,000 people who develop optic neuritis in the United States each year will develop multiple sclerosis within five years.\n",
      "Symptoms of retrobulbar neuritis": "Symptoms usually worsen for two weeks and then stabilize. However, the course of the illness varies greatly. Most cases show improvement over time, although persistent visual impairment is common. Optic neuritis usually affects only one eye, but both eyes may be affected. Common symptoms include:\n",
      "Diagnosing retrobulbar neuritis": "A doctor will use an ophthalmoscope or other specialized equipment (such as a slit lamp) to examine the back of the eye, particularly the optic disc. This is where the optic nerve fibers concentrate before exiting the eye to extend back toward the brain. In the early stages of retrobulbar neuritis, the optic disk may appear normal. Later, it may become pale.\nThe pupil normally becomes smaller (constricts) in response to light. In retrobulbar neuritis, this response often is reduced in the affected eye. The doctor also will test your visual acuity, which frequently is impaired in the affected eye. The doctor will test your side (peripheral) vision because, in many cases of retrobulbar neuritis, a scotoma (a blind or dark spot in the visual field) may be detected. The doctor also may search for associated conditions such as infection or multiple sclerosis, after a detailed discussion about other symptoms and a complete physical examination.\n",
      "Expected duration of retrobulbar neuritis": "How long this condition lasts depends on the cause, and in some people optic neuritis recurs or becomes chronic. If the optic nerve is permanently damaged, it can lead to blindness.\n",
      "Preventing retrobulbar neuritis": "Because the underlying cause of most cases of retrobulbar neuritis is unknown, there is usually no way to prevent it. Practicing safe sex to avoid certain infections such as syphilis and being cautious around chemicals and toxins is always wise.\n",
      "Treating retrobulbar neuritis": "Many cases improve without treatment. A corticosteroid medication, such as intravenous methylprednisolone, may be recommended, especially if vision loss is significant or if an MRI shows abnormalities suggestive of multiple sclerosis. Additional treatments for suspected multiple sclerosis may be offered, including interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), or teriflunomide (Aubagio); these medications may reduce the chances of recurrent neuritis or other symptoms of multiple sclerosis.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call a doctor if you experience any vision changes, either suddenly or over time. Pain in or around the eye, with or without vision loss, also should receive prompt medical attention.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the cause. Cases in which there is no obvious cause, or in which the cause is multiple sclerosis, often improve after two weeks, but the vision may never completely return to normal.\nRetrobulbar neuritis may return, and many people with retrobulbar neuritis eventually develop multiple sclerosis. If an MRI image of the brain is abnormal in a manner typical of multiple sclerosis at the time of retrobulbar neuritis, clinically obvious multiple sclerosis is much more likely than if the MRI is normal.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Ejaculation is the ejection of semen out of the urethra (passageway inside the penis) when a man has an orgasm. Under normal circumstances, ejaculation propels semen forward through a man's urethra and out the tip of his penis. This is because a tiny sphincter (circular muscle) at the entrance to the bladder shuts the opening to the bladder and prevents semen from entering. Retrograde ejaculation is when the semen travels backwards into the bladder.\nIn retrograde ejaculation, the muscle that shuts the bladder does not function normally. This allows all or part of the semen to travel backward (retrograde) into the bladder at the time of ejaculation. When this happens, less semen comes out the tip of the penis.\nRetrograde ejaculation has several possible causes, including:\nRetrograde ejaculation does not interfere with a man's ability to have an erection or to achieve orgasm, but it can cause infertility because the sperm cannot reach the woman's uterus. Retrograde ejaculation is responsible for about 1% of all cases of male infertility in the United States.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Normally, a healthy adult male ejaculates one-half to one teaspoonful of semen during orgasm, but the amount varies widely. In men with retrograde ejaculation, the amount of semen is decreased dramatically or there is a dry climax (orgasm without semen).\n",
      "Diagnosis": "In most cases, the diagnosis will be made by a primary care doctor or a urologist, a doctor who specializes in male reproductive disorders and urinary tract problems. The doctor will ask questions about your medical history, previous surgery, sexual history and current medications. These questions will be followed by a thorough physical examination. The diagnosis usually can be confirmed if many sperm are found in a urine sample after ejaculation.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "How long this problem lasts depends on the cause. If your retrograde ejaculation is a side effect of medication, the problem may go away when your doctor switches you to a different drug. On the other hand, if your retrograde ejaculation is caused by severe nerve or muscle damage, the condition may be permanent.\n",
      "Prevention": "There now are innovative, minimally invasive forms of prostate surgery for enlarged prostates (not cancer) that may cause less retrograde ejaculation than the standard procedures. These newer procedures include transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA) and transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT). Even if these procedures cause fewer cases of retrograde ejaculation, however, they may not be appropriate for all patients.\n",
      "Treatment": "Most men who have retrograde ejaculation do not need specific treatment. If the condition is a side effect of medication, your doctor may be able to switch you to a different drug that does not cause the problem. In other men, all that is needed is reassurance that retrograde ejaculation is not a serious medical problem and that it is not a sign of a serious condition.\nIn some men, retrograde ejaculation requires treatment because it interferes with fertility. This treatment varies depending on the cause. If your retrograde ejaculation is a side effect of medication, your doctor probably will switch you to a drug that does not affect ejaculation.\nIf your retrograde ejaculation is the result of damage to the nerves or muscles of your bladder, then it may not be possible to restore normal ejaculation. If this is the case, and you are hoping to father a child, a fertility specialist may be able to help. In cases of retrograde ejaculation, three of the more commonly used assisted fertilization procedures are:\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Contact your doctor if you produce little or no semen when you ejaculate, especially if you are hoping to father a child.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Simple therapies have a good chance of decreasing retrograde ejaculation enough to allow conception.\nIn men who do not respond to medication, fathering a child may still be possible with the help of assisted fertilization procedures.\n",

      "What is it?": "Reye syndrome is a very rare disorder that damages many parts of the body, especially the brain and the liver. For unknown reasons, the parts of the cells that make energy (mitochondria) stop working correctly, which causes severe illness. The most serious problems are swelling of the brain and problems with the breakdown of fat, which results in buildup in the liver and other organs. The illness can be fatal, especially if not detected early and treated appropriately.\nAlthough Reye syndrome can occur at any age, it most often affects children between the ages of 3 and 12.\nReye syndrome typically occurs several days after the child is recovering from a viral infection, such as the flu, common cold, or chickenpox. It also can develop while the child is still sick, a few days after the viral illness began. While the exact cause of Reye syndrome is not known, researchers believe that it may be due to an abnormal response to aspirin or aspirin-containing products taken during a viral illness. For this reason, never give aspirin or aspirin-containing medicines to children with fever or a flu-like illness.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms can include\nIn infants, the symptoms of Reye syndrome may not follow this typical pattern. For example, infants with Reye syndrome do not always vomit.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The doctor may suspect a child has Reye syndrome based on the symptoms and a history of very recent viral illness. Blood tests, including tests of liver function, will be done. Imaging tests such as ultrasound and CT scans usually show steatosis (fatty infiltration) of the liver and other organs. Other tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, including:\nReye syndrome can be difficult to diagnose. It is sometimes mistaken for other serious illnesses, such as encephalitis, meningitis, uncontrolled diabetes, or drug overdose.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long it takes to recover from Reye syndrome depends on how much the brain has swelled. People with mild disease usually recover quickly and completely.\n",
      "Prevention": "Although a clear link between aspirin and Reye syndrome has not yet been proven, experts agree that to prevent Reye syndrome, the safest approach is never to give aspirin or aspirin-containing medicines to children unless specifically recommended by the child's doctor. Read labels carefully. Look for the word aspirin and other words that also mean aspirin: acetylsalicylate, acetylsalicylic acid, salicylic acid and salicylate. When necessary, non-aspirin medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), should be used instead.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the symptoms, but all patients with Reye syndrome need to be treated in a hospital and monitored closely. Treatment focuses on protecting the brain against irreversible damage by preventing or reducing brain swelling.\nSpecific treatments may include\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Reye syndrome is a serious, life-threatening condition. If your child has had a viral infection and has any symptoms of Reye syndrome, call your doctor immediately. It is an emergency!\n",
      "Prognosis": "With early diagnosis and treatment, the chances of recovery are usually excellent. Some people will recover fully, while others may have permanent brain damage. The outlook is poorer for people with Reye syndrome who rapidly become unconscious. If diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the chances of successful recovery and survival are less.\n",

      "What is it?": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic (long-lasting) inflammatory disease that causes pain, stiffness, warmth, redness and swelling in joints. Over time, the affected joints may become misshapen, misaligned and damaged. Tissue lining the joint can become thick, and may wear away surrounding ligaments, cartilage and bone as it spreads. Rheumatoid arthritis usually occurs in a symmetrical pattern, meaning that if one knee or hand has it, the other usually does, too.\n\nThe cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, although it appears to be an autoimmune disease. When the body's immune system does not operate as it should, white blood cells that normally attack bacteria or viruses attack healthy tissue instead — in this case, the synovium, or joint tissue. As the synovial membrane (the thin layer of cells lining the joint) becomes inflamed, enzymes are released. Over time, these enzymes and certain immune cells damage the cartilage, bone, tendons and ligaments near the joint.\nSome research suggests that a virus triggers this faulty immune response. However, there is not yet convincing evidence that a virus is the cause of rheumatoid arthritis. At the same time, it appears that some people are more likely to get the disease because of their genetics. Environmental factors may also be important. For example, smoking is a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis.\nRheumatoid arthritis, the most disabling form of arthritis, generally affects more than one joint at a time. Commonly affected joints include those in the hands, wrists, feet, ankles, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees and neck. Rheumatoid arthritis can result in loose, deformed joints, loss of mobility and diminished strength. It also can cause painless lumps the size of a pea or acorn, called rheumatoid nodules. These develop under the skin, especially around the elbow or beneath the toes.\nGenerally, the pain of rheumatoid arthritis is described as a dull ache, similar to that of a headache or toothache. Pain is typically worse in the morning. It is not rare to have 30 minutes to an hour or more of morning stiffness. On days when the disease is more active, you may experience fatigue, loss of appetite, low-grade fever, sweats and difficulty sleeping.\nBecause rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease (meaning it can affect the entire body), you also may have inflammation in other areas, including the heart, lungs or eyes. Symptoms vary between people and even in one person over time. People with mild forms of the disease are bothered by pain and stiffness, but they may not experience any joint damage. For other people, damage occurs early, requiring aggressive medical and surgical treatment. People with rheumatoid arthritis may notice worsening and improvement for no apparent reason. Although this disease most often afflicts people between the ages of 20 and 50, it may affect children and the elderly. Of the 1.5 million people with rheumatoid arthritis in the United States, at least 75 percent are women.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms include:\nOther symptoms depend on whether other parts of the body are involved. For example, for those with lung involvement, shortness of breath is common.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history, and will examine you. You also may be sent for a blood test. An abnormal antibody, called the rheumatoid factor (RF), is found in the blood of 60 percent to 70 percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, having RF does not necessarily mean you have rheumatoid arthritis. Many people who do not have rheumatoid arthritis can have RF appear in their blood.\nAnother antibody, called the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), is also present in about 65% of people with rheumatoid arthritis but it is a more specific indicator of rheumatoid arthritis — that is, few people without rheumatoid arthritis have this antibody. While it is more specific, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis cannot be based solely on any single blood test. Other blood tests may be performed to look for other causes of joint pain.\nWhile x-rays may be normal in the first few weeks or months of disease, joint damage (called erosions) may eventually appear.  MRI or ultrasound may show evidence of joint inflammation earlier than x-rays.\nYou may hear about a checklist of symptoms (called criteria) for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. Although many physicians use this checklist as a guide, it is important to know that some patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not have many of the symptoms on the list, especially if their disease is mild. And some people with other forms of arthritis may meet criteria for rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis relies mostly on the experience and judgment of the doctor, and is based on the \"big picture\" of symptoms, examination and test results. The diagnosis also depends on excluding other explanations for the symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Most people with rheumatoid arthritis have chronic (long-lasting) symptoms. They experience periods when symptoms get worse, called flare-ups, and periods when symptoms improve. Rarely, symptoms and signs of the disease disappear without treatment, called a spontaneous remission.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent rheumatoid arthritis. However, smoking is a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis. So this is one more reason not to smoke.\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has improved dramatically in the past 50 years. A comprehensive approach that combines medications, rest balanced with exercise, lifestyle modifications, and sometimes surgery, can help many people to lead normal lives. The most important goals in treating rheumatoid arthritis are maintaining your ability to move and function, reducing pain, and preventing future joint damage. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential. If control of disease is achieved soon after symptoms begin, long-term outcomes tend to be good and quality of life and length of life may be normal. The treatments themselves may cause problems. You and your doctor will have to weigh the risks and benefits of any medication or other treatment that is available for this disease.\n",
      "Medications": "Certain medications relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (such as pain and swelling), while other medications slow the progress of the disease.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including over-the-counter aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin and other brand names) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or prescription NSAIDs can help relieve symptoms. Side effects occur in a minority of patients. These include upset stomach, ulcers, reduced kidney function or allergic reactions.\nNewer NSAIDs, such as celecoxib (Celebrex), may provide the same benefits for arthritis as older medications but with less risk of ulcers. However, the risk of ulcers is not zero. One study showed that for people at highest risk (those with recent bleeding ulcer), up to 10 percent of those treated with celecoxib developed a new ulcer. In addition, the risk was similar for these high-risk patients taking celecoxib and those taking an older agent (diclofenac) combined with the acid blocker omeprazole. People taking celecoxib may also have a higher risk of cardiovascular problems (such as heart attack) than those taking other NSAIDs.\nOther pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or tramadol (Ultram), may provide pain relief when taken with or without an NSAID.\nCorticosteroids, such as prednisone (Deltasone and other brand names), reduce inflammation. However, they have little lasting benefit and come with a long list of troubling side effects, such as easy bruising, thinning of the bones, cataracts, weight gain, puffy face, diabetes and high blood pressure, among others. If you do use corticosteroids, follow your doctor's recommendations closely. Your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid to relieve occasional flare-ups, and then gradually taper you off the medication. Stopping corticosteroid therapy suddenly after taking it for more than a week or two can be dangerous.\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (called DMARDs, second-line drugs or remittive therapy) appear to slow or halt the progression of rheumatoid arthritis by altering the function of your body's immune system. Most experts recommend that all people with rheumatoid arthritis take a DMARD soon after being diagnosed to reduce the chances of joint damage. These medications take weeks to months to start working. Therefore, your doctor probably may advise you to take an NSAID, a corticosteroid, or both during the early weeks or months of treatment with a DMARD.\nThese drugs include methotrexate (Folex, Methotrexate LPF, Rheumatrex), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), leflunomide (Arava) or sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Treatment commonly includes methotrexate as the initial choice but combinations of these medications (e.g., methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine) may be prescribed. Each of these comes with a risk of serious side effects. Your doctors will review them with you.\nNewer medications, called \"biologics\" include:\nThese medications are available by injection only. They can be highly effective, but many patients improve with older medications that are much less expensive (and many health insurance companies will not cover biologics before older medications are tried first), so most doctors recommend older treatments first.\nNewer medications, baricitinib (Olumiant), tofacitinib (Xeljanz), and upadacitinib (Rinvoq) are not biologic agents — they are called \"Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors\" because they block an enzyme (Janus kinase) involved in inflammation. These medications offer patients another option for treatment, and while they are also quite expensive, they have one advantage over the other newer drugs: they are available in pill form.\nAnother drug for rheumatoid arthritis is anakinra (Kineret), an injectable drug that appears to be only modestly effective but may be a reasonable option if other treatments have failed. Other therapies include minocycline (Minocin), azathioprine (Imuran), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), gold and penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen). However, these treatments are used much less often now than in the past because most experts find that they are not as effective or safe.\nBecause the newest medications have generally been studied only in selected, and often the healthiest, people, they may have side effects that are not yet well known. For example, studies found that tuberculosis, although rare, was more common than expected among those receiving treatment with certain biologic agents. These findings have led to new recommendations about how patients should be screened before treatment begins.\n",
      "Diet, exercise, and rehabilitation services": "Finding a balance between rest and exercise is crucial to managing rheumatoid arthritis. When your symptoms flare up — when your joints are sore, warm and swollen — take it easy and rest. You can continue to do range-of-motion exercises to keep your joints mobile, but be careful not to tire yourself or aggravate your joints. Avoid unnecessary walking, housework or other activities. When your joints feel better and when other symptoms, including fatigue and morning stiffness, are less noticeable, increase your activity. Weight-bearing exercises such as walking and lifting weights can strengthen weakened muscles without risking additional joint damage. If exercise produces more pain or joint swelling, cut back a bit.\nDespite many claims, there are no dietary changes, supplements, herbs, or other alternative therapies proven to control the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis or protect the joints over a long period of time. However, a diet that helps you lose excess weight can be helpful for weight-bearing joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, evidence is accumulating that an anti-inflammatory diet (along with medication therapy) may be helpful.\nHaving rheumatoid arthritis often means that you have to pay special attention to the way you move. An occupational therapist or physical therapist can offer suggestions and guidance as you manage ordinary tasks around your home and work. In addition, a therapist can provide special devices that can help you conserve energy and protect your joints during your daily activities. A splint, brace, sling or Ace bandage worn when your joints are especially tender can take the pressure off the joints and protect them from injury. A podiatrist may provide shoe inserts (orthotics) or even suggest surgery to improve pain and function in arthritic feet.\n",
      "Surgery": "In some cases, surgery is needed to remove inflamed tissue, or to reconstruct or replace the affected joint. When rheumatoid arthritis causes significant destruction and pain in the hip or knee, arthroplasty, a surgical procedure to replace the joint, may be an effective option. Because rheumatoid arthritis may cause tendon damage, especially in the hand and wrist, surgical tendon repair may be recommended.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Early, effective treatment can help you live well with rheumatoid arthritis, although the severity of the disease and its response to therapy are highly variable.\n",

      "What is ringworm?": "Ringworm, also called tinea, is a skin infection caused by fungi, microscopic organisms that are similar to yeast and molds. It does not have any relation to worms, but is called \"ringworm\" because the infection can produce ring-shaped patches on the skin that have red, wormlike edges.\n\nAlthough ringworm can affect almost any area of the body, it favors places that are warm, dark and moist, such as skin in the groin area, the spaces between the toes and the deep skin folds of obese people. People can catch ringworm in several different ways, including:\nDepending on its specific location, tinea may be known by a more common name, such as athlete's foot or jock itch. The various types of ringworm include:\nDoctors estimate that at least 20% of all people will develop tinea at some time during life. People who are more likely to get a fungal skin infection include:\n",
      "Symptoms of ringworm": "Symptoms of ringworm vary, depending on the site of the infection:\n",
      "Diagnosing ringworm": "The best way for your doctor to diagnose any type of fungal infection in the skin is by scraping the area, and looking at the specimen under a microscope to see if it contains fungi. He or she also can determine if you have ringworm by the way it looks.\nAlthough you may be able to diagnose yourself, you should call your doctor before you use over-the-counter treatment. Your doctor will ask you questions about your lifestyle, including whether you are athletic and routinely walk barefoot in pool or locker room areas; live or work in crowded conditions; share clothing, shoes, towels or grooming items; or have been exposed recently to someone with symptoms of ringworm.\nIf your symptoms involve the scalp or beard, you should be seen by a doctor before attempting any treatment.\n",
      "Expected duration of ringworm": "With proper treatment, both jock itch and ringworm of the body usually improve within one to two weeks. Ringworm of the scalp or beard may take a few weeks longer. However, athlete's foot can be a chronic (long-lasting) problem that comes and goes over many years. This can be caused in part by an active lifestyle that keeps the feet moist and sweaty.\n",
      "Preventing ringworm": "To help prevent tinea, try the following suggestions:\n",
      "Treating ringworm": "If you have jock itch, athlete's foot, or ringworm of the body, you usually can be treated with a nonprescription antifungal cream, lotion, or powder. Your doctor can recommend the appropriate treatment for your condition. Some of the nonprescription topical medications available include terbinafine (Lamisil), tolnaftate (Tinactin), miconazole (Micatin and other brand names), clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex), and undecylenic acid (Desenex and other brand names). Be sure to follow the directions carefully when you apply the medication.\nIf your symptoms do not improve significantly after you have used a nonprescription medicine for about two weeks, call your doctor. Your doctor may suggest a prescription antifungal medication that will cure the problem. For extremely stubborn infections, the antifungal medication may be taken by mouth rather than being applied to the skin.\nIf you have a fungal infection of the scalp, beard, fingernails, or toenails, your doctor may treat you with an oral antifungal medication, such as oral terbinafine (Lamisil), itraconazole (Sporanox) or griseofulvin (Grisactin and other brand names). You also will have to apply antifungal creams or shampoos to your hair and scalp. Complete treatment can take two or three months.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Make an appointment to see your doctor if you have symptoms of ringworm that involve the scalp or beard. Ringworm can sometimes be confused with other skin problems. If in doubt, see your doctor for a correct diagnosis.\nIf your immune system is weakened by illness or medication, contact your doctor promptly whenever you develop any unusual skin symptoms. In particular, people with diabetes should have skin symptoms, especially on the feet, checked as soon as possible.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although treatment may take several weeks, antifungal medication almost always cures ringworm infections. Hair eventually regrows, and scarring is rare.\nHowever, people do not develop immunity to tinea. Because it is possible to catch the fungus again, follow the suggestions outlined in the Prevention section above to avoid getting infected again.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a severe illness caused by tiny bacteria called Rickettsia rickettsii, which are transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. In the eastern United States and in California, the infected tick is usually Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick. In most of the western United States, the tick is more likely to be Dermacentor andersoni, the Rocky Mountain wood tick. Humans typically become infected in the spring and early summer.\nOnce someone is bitten by an infected tick, Rocky Mountain spotted fever bacteria can spread throughout the bloodstream and lymphatic system. The tick must remain attached and be actively feeding to transmit the bacteria. Not everybody who is bitten by an infected tick develops Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It is not clear why some people get the disease and others do not.\nOnce in the body, the bacteria attack and severely damage the linings of blood vessels. The injured vessels leak a watery fluid, which causes swelling. The blood vessels also can lose blood, which causes potentially life-threatening hemorrhages (serious bleeding). As damaged blood vessels continue to leak, blood pressure can decrease. If this happens, blood flow to the kidneys can decrease, causing kidney damage and, possibly, kidney failure. Rocky Mountain spotted fever bacteria also may attack the brain directly, causing symptoms of encephalitis (brain infection) or meningoencephalitis (infection of the brain and its surrounding membranes). Rocky Mountain spotted fever also can cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) as a result of liver injury. In the lungs, Rocky Mountain spotted fever can lead to an accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and severe breathing difficulties.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) up to 4000 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever or related infections in the United States each year. Children aged 5 to 9 are more likely to be infected than any other age group.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Typically, symptoms begin 2 to 14 days after a tick bite, with an average of 1 week. During the first 3 days of symptoms, an infected person usually has a fever of more than 102 degrees Fahrenheit and a severe headache. Muscle aches, nausea and vomiting are common. Between the 3rd and 5th day of fever, most people develop a rash, which usually begins on the wrists and ankles, then spreads to the arms, legs and trunk. In about two-thirds of patients, the rash also involves the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. On day 6 or later, the areas of rash may show tiny broken blood vessels and small hemorrhages under the skin.\nOther symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The classic features that may lead your doctor to suspect Rocky Mountain spotted fever are high fever, rash, headache, and a history of tick exposure, such as walking in a tick-infested area, within 14 days of developing the symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Only about 60% of patients recall being bitten by a tick.\nThe early symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever are not specific, and diagnostic tests often are negative early in the disease. Therefore, if your doctor suspects that you have Rocky Mountain spotted fever, he or she generally will begin treatment immediately, even if your blood tests are negative. Early treatment is essential to help you avoid severe complications. Your doctor also may remove a small piece of skin from the area of the rash so it can be examined in a laboratory. This procedure is called a biopsy. The biopsy sample can be tested in the laboratory with chemicals to confirm the presence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever bacteria. Blood tests can confirm the diagnosis, but only two to three weeks after the onset of infection. There are no specific abnormalities on blood tests that indicate an active infection early on.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever begin 2 to 14 days after a bite by an infected tick. Most cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever respond to appropriate antibiotic treatment within a week. Once symptoms develop, a person can die within 2 weeks without proper treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "Because there is no vaccine against Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the most effective way to prevent the illness is to avoid walking in wooded areas or fields where ticks are found. If you must walk in tick-infested areas, follow these precautions:\n",
      "Treatment": "Rocky Mountain spotted fever is treated with one of the tetracycline drugs, usually doxycycline (sold as a generic), in adults and children over age 9. In general, tetracyclines should not be prescribed for pregnant women and children under the age of 9 because these antibiotics can permanently stain the teeth. However, doxycycline is the best available antibiotic to treat this potentially life threatening infection and is preferred if Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the likely diagnosis, despite the teeth staining. Chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) is another antibiotic that attacks the bacteria, but it appears to be less effective than doxycycline and is only recommended when doxycycline cannot be given due to allergy or other reaction.\nMost people are cured after taking the antibiotics for five to seven days. Patients may need to be hospitalized if there is severe lung damage, kidney failure, significant bleeding or severe brain involvement. In cases of respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation (treatment with a machine that breathes for the patient) may be necessary. Patients with kidney failure may require dialysis. Those with severe bleeding may need blood transfusions.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you develop fever, headaches and nausea, with or without a rash, after you have been bitten by a tick. Even if you don't remember being bitten, call your doctor if you develop these symptoms and you have walked recently in tick-infested areas.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Before effective antibiotics were available, 20% to 25% of people with Rocky Mountain spotted fever died. Now, however, less than 5% of patients die from this illness. Older patients have a slightly higher risk of death than younger ones, and males have a higher risk than females.\n",

      "What is rosacea?": "Rosacea (rose-ay-shah) is a common, long-lasting skin condition that causes inflammation and redness of the face. It usually starts with redness on the cheeks and nose, and also can affect the forehead and chin. The late comedian W.C. Fields, who was known for his wicked wit and red, bulbous nose, had an advanced case of rosacea.\n\nRosacea tends to affect fair-skinned adults between ages 30 and 50 who have \"peaches and cream\" complexions and a history of blushing easily. Women develop rosacea more often than men, but men are more apt to develop lumpy, enlarged noses, a condition called rhinophyma. Rosacea often is mistaken for sunburn and often goes undiagnosed. It is a very treatable condition.\n",
      "Symptoms of rosacea": "There are four progressive stages of rosacea:\nHere's a detailed look at the most common symptoms of rosacea.\n",
      "Diagnosing rosacea": "A doctor usually can diagnose rosacea based on the history of flushing and the appearance of your skin. In the early stages of rosacea, the rash sometimes can be mistaken for sunburn, acne, hot flashes of menopause or allergy to cosmetics.\n",
      "Expected duration of rosacea": "Symptoms of rosacea commonly come and go in cycles, often triggered by substances and situations that make the face flush. By seeking medical help early and adhering to medical treatments, you can improve your skin condition and perhaps stop, or reverse, the progress of this condition.\n",
      "Preventing rosacea": "Although a recent study found fewer cases of rosacea among people who drank caffeinated coffee, there is no proven way to prevent rosacea. The symptoms may be reduced by recognizing these common triggers: hot drinks, alcohol, spicy foods, stress, sunlight, extreme heat or cold. These conditions increase blood flow and cause the small blood vessels in the face to widen (dilate). If you have rosacea, try to identify your particular triggers and either modify them or avoid them entirely.\nTo cleanse and moisturize your face, you should select facial products that do not burn, sting, irritate or cause redness when they are applied. You should wash your face with lukewarm water and a mild soap, using your fingertips to apply the soap gently. You should avoid toners, astringents, scrubs, exfoliating agents and products that contain alcohol or acetone. Hydroxy acids and tretinoin (for example, Retin A) may sensitize the skin to sun and can worsen rosacea.\nSunscreens and sun blockers should be used regularly and liberally to protect the face. Use sunscreens with SPF factor of 30 or higher. If chemical sunscreens cause stinging, switch to physical sun blocks, which contain titanium or zinc oxide.\n",
      "Treating rosacea": "Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe the following:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if you notice a persistent facial blush, or if your complexion shows persistent pimples and red, dry, scaly blotches. Also call your doctor if you suspect that constant redness on your cheeks is not caused by sunburn or by your tendency to blush easily. Remember, it's easy to misdiagnose rosacea as acne, and using nonprescription acne medications may worsen your rosacea by irritating skin that is already dry and sensitive.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The progression of rosacea varies from person to person, depending on factors such as genetics, skin sensitivity, skin complexion, length of time spent in sunlight without sunscreen, consumption of alcohol and spicy foods, and exposure to extreme hot and cold temperatures. With appropriate treatment and avoidance of triggers, rosacea generally can be well controlled.\n",

      "What is it?": "Four tendons attach muscles from the shoulder blade and ribs to the upper arm bone (humerus). Because these tendons help to rotate the arm within its socket, this sleeve of tendons is called the rotator cuff.\n\nTendons in the rotator cuff can be injured easily because they move within a tight space. When the shoulder is turned or lifted at the limit of its natural range of movement, the tendons in this tight space are moved, too. Occasionally, the rotator cuff tendons can bump or rub against a bony knob (the acromion) above them or against a ligament at the front of the shoulder.\nThis friction is known as impingement syndrome and causes inflammation in the rotator cuff. Rotator cuff friction is most likely to cause inflammation if your shoulder movement is rough or repetitive. Inflammation can cause three problems:\n\nSeveral types of shoulder use commonly trigger rotator cuff injury:\nIn addition, your shoulder can be injured more easily if it is out of shape. The narrow space that envelops the rotator cuff tendons becomes even narrower if your shoulder muscles are weakened or tight. When this happens, routine shoulder movements are more likely to cause tendon friction.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Rotator cuff injuries cause pain in your shoulder and upper arm. The pain may be most noticeable when you reach up or out. When you turn your arm as you lift it, the tendons are more likely to rub against surrounding structures. For this reason your shoulder symptoms may be worst when you try to comb your hair or slip your arm into a sleeve. You also may have dull, aching shoulder pain at night.\nRotator cuff tears that affect a significant portion of the tendon cause weakness of the shoulder, limiting your ability to hold your arm out to one side or to lift an object. Difficulty using the shoulder because of pain does not always mean that there is a tear. Rotator cuff injuries cause pain in your shoulder and upper arm. The pain may be most noticeable when you reach up or out. When you turn your arm as you lift it, the tendons are more likely to rub against surrounding structures. For this reason your shoulder symptoms may be worst when you try to comb your hair or slip your arm into a sleeve. You also may have dull, aching shoulder pain at night.\nRotator cuff tears that affect a significant portion of the tendon cause weakness of the shoulder, limiting your ability to hold your arm out to one side or to lift an object. Difficulty using the shoulder because of pain does not always mean that there is a tear.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A rotator cuff injury usually is diagnosed by physical examination. Your doctor will rotate your arm at the shoulder and then will raise your arm. If this type of motion causes pain, the rotator cuff may be inflamed.\nIf you have noticeable weakness, you may need further testing to check for a rotator cuff tear. Your doctor may inject a numbing medicine into your shoulder to help distinguish actual weakness of the tendon from your muscle \"giving way\" because of pain.\nIf a tear is suspected, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan can confirm the diagnosis. An alternative diagnostic test is a shoulder arthrogram. An arthrogram is an X-ray of a joint following injection of dye into the joint. Because MRIs provide excellent pictures without putting a needle into a joint, arthrograms are done less frequently today.\n\nShoulder X-rays are not always needed, but may be helpful if you have had trauma to the shoulder or if your doctor cannot move your shoulder through its full range of motion. Another reason to do a shoulder X-ray is too look for calcium deposits in or around the shoulder. Calcium deposits form on a persistently inflamed tendon, causing a condition called calcific tendonitis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Without proper treatment, symptoms of a rotator cuff injury or tear can persist for months or years, and usually become worse over time. Most rotator cuff injuries respond to treatment within four to six weeks, especially if an injection is part of the treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "In many cases, a rotator cuff injury can be avoided. To avoid reaching over your head repeatedly, use a step stool or ladder during projects. Avoid using your arms to push off from a chair. For people who are in poor athletic shape or who have arthritis in the knees, exercises to strengthen the quadriceps muscles in the thighs can be very helpful, so that it is not necessary for you to use your arms to get up from sitting.\nPeople who are dependent on their arms to rise out of a chair can raise the seat of their favorite chair with a thick folded blanket or a short platform to make it easier to get up.\nExercises that strengthen the rotator cuff muscles also are an important part of prevention. Some of the rotator cuff muscles pull down on the upper arm bone as they work, widening the space that the tendons travel through. Physical therapy that strengthens the rotator cuff muscles can make your shoulder less vulnerable to injury.\n",
      "Treatment": "Tendonitis, bursitis and small rotator cuff tears in the shoulder can be treated effectively with an injection of a corticosteroid medicine followed by physical therapy exercises to restore shoulder movement and strengthen the rotator cuff muscles. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) are useful to decrease pain and inflammation.\nIf your doctor determines that you have calcific tendonitis (calcium deposits), other treatments may be helpful. There is some evidence that treatment of the shoulder with ultrasound or a procedure called lithotripsy, which uses powerful ultrasound waves known as shock waves, may help to break up calcium deposits and speed healing.\nSurgery may be necessary for frequently recurring rotator cuff injuries or large tears in a rotator cuff tendon. Either arthroscopy (camera-assisted surgery) or traditional open surgery can be used.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "A doctor should evaluate shoulder symptoms that last for more than one week.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People with a rotator cuff injury typically recover well with treatment. However, it's common to injure the same shoulder again, especially if you do not change the way you use your shoulder. Elderly people are prone to rotator cuff problems and have a harder time recovering because their shoulders have a less robust blood supply.\n",

      "What is it?": "The salivary glands make saliva and release it into the mouth.\nThere are three pairs of relatively large, major salivary glands:\n\nIn addition to these major glands, 600 to 1,000 very tiny, minor salivary glands are scattered throughout the mouth and throat. They are located under the moist skin that lines the\nSome of the most common salivary gland disorders include:\nSome stones sit inside the gland without causing any symptoms. In other cases, a stone blocks the gland's duct, either partially or completely. When this happens, the gland typically is painful and swollen, and saliva flow is partially or completely blocked. This can be followed by an infection called sialadenitis.\nWithout proper treatment, sialadenitis can develop into a severe infection, especially in people who are debilitated or elderly.\nMost people with this disease are women who first develop symptoms during middle age. In about half of cases, the illness occurs together with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), scleroderma or polymyositis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary, depending on the specific type of salivary gland disorder:\nThese symptoms are followed by swelling in the parotid glands, usually on both sides of the face. It may difficult to fully open the mouth.\n",

The doctor will press gently on areas of your cheeks to feel for swelling of the parotid gland. He or she also will feel under your jaw for enlarged salivary glands. Tell your doctor if there is any tenderness during the exam.\nDepending on your symptoms, history and physical findings, the doctor may order one or more of the following tests:\n",

      "What is sarcoidosis?": "Sarcoidosis is an illness that causes tiny islands of inflammatory cells to form throughout the body. These microscopic groups of cells are called granulomas. They are especially common in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and liver. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown.\nSometimes these granulomas cause very little damage, so a person with sarcoidosis does not have any symptoms of illness and may not even know they have it. In other cases, however, the granulomas produce large areas of inflammation and scarring that can interfere with an organ's normal functions. Although most people with sarcoidosis eventually recover, a few develop forms of the illness that are long-lasting (chronic) and get worse with time.\nSarcoidosis can affect almost any organ in the body. But the most common targets are the lung and nearby lymph nodes.\nAlthough doctors do not know the exact cause of sarcoidosis, there is strong evidence that the illness involves an abnormal immune reaction. For example, it is known that the granulomas contain cells from the immune system, particularly a type called helper-inducer T cells. Some experts believe that the abnormal immune reaction of sarcoidosis may be triggered by an infection. Others suspect that the illness may follow exposure to an allergen (allergy-producing agent) in the environment. In addition, genetic (inherited) factors probably play some role in increasing a person's risk of developing the illness.\nIn the United States, sarcoidosis affects African Americans three to four times as often as white people. Other groups with a higher than average risk of developing sarcoidosis are Scandinavian, Irish, British, and Asian. In general, women are affected more often than men.\n",
      "Symptoms of sarcoidosis": "Some people with sarcoidosis do not have any symptoms. Others have nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, fever, poor appetite, night sweats, joint pain, or aching muscles.\nSymptoms vary widely because the disease affects different parts of the body in different people. Among those who see their doctors for specific symptoms, more than 90% have problems involving the lungs. The first signs are usually a dry cough and shortness of breath. Later there may also be wheezing, chest pain, and, rarely, a cough that brings up bloody mucus. In severe cases, lung function may become so poor that you cannot do even simple, routine tasks of daily life.\nOther symptoms of sarcoidosis are less common than lung symptoms. They can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing sarcoidosis": "In most cases, your doctor will diagnose sarcoidosis based on three factors:\nIt is common for sarcoidosis to be suspected based on abnormal results on a chest x-ray ordered for unrelated reasons. For example, a person who is otherwise healthy may have a chest x-ray as a requirement for his or her work and discover abnormalities that suggest the diagnosis.\nBesides the chest x-ray and biopsy mentioned above, additional tests may be recommended. These tests may be performed to rule out other illnesses, or to assess the amount of organ damage caused by sarcoidosis. Some of the most common tests are:\n",
      "Expected duration of sarcoidosis": "Up to a third of people have chronic or progressive forms of the illness. In general, the illness tends to be more severe in African Americans than in white populations.\n",
      "Preventing sarcoidosis": "Because the cause of sarcoidosis is not known, there is no way to prevent it.\n",
      "Treating sarcoidosis": "If your sarcoidosis does not cause any significant symptoms or medical problems, you may not need treatment. Instead, your doctor may decide to simply monitor your condition. As part of this monitoring process, you may have frequent office visits, follow-up chest x-rays, and tests of your blood and lung function.\nTo treat joint pain, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often are used first before corticosteroids, which tend to have more side effects. If you have signs of moderate or severe lung disease, your doctor may recommend an oral corticosteroid drug, such as prednisone (sold under several brand names) or an inhaled steroid. Corticosteroids also are used to treat sarcoidosis of the joints, skin, nerves, or heart. Corticosteroid eye drops may be used for the eyes.\nIf corticosteroids are not effective or if they cause serious side effects, other drugs that alter or suppress the immune system may be used. Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and methotrexate (Folex, Rheumatrex) are among the more common medications in this group.\nOther options include leflunomide (Arava), azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil. Newer, injectable medications, including infliximab (Remicade) or adalimumab (Humira), may be effective when other treatments have failed. In rare cases, when sarcoidosis causes life-threatening lung disease, a lung transplant may be necessary.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many people with sarcoidosis have no significant disease activity and require no therapy. For these people, the outlook is excellent. Only a small percentage of people develop permanent or progressive organ damage. Death related to sarcoidosis is rare, and is most commonly due to severe sarcoidosis involving the heart or lungs.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you develop any of the symptoms of sarcoidosis, such as shortness of breath or a lingering cough.\n",

      "What is it?": "Scarlet fever is an infection caused by Group A Streptococcus (andquot;strep\") bacteria. It causes a finely textured rash that can appear like sandpaper along with other symptoms. It usually occurs after a strep infection of the throat (strep pharyngitis, or strep throat), but occasionally after a strep skin infection. The rash of scarlet fever is caused by a toxin that the strep bacteria produce.\nScarlet fever once was common among children ages 2 to 10, but now it is relatively rare. The reason for this remains a mystery, especially because there has been no decrease in the number of cases of strep throat or strep skin infections.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Scarlet fever usually is triggered by a strep throat infection, which causes the following symptoms:\nWithin 12 to 48 hours after these symptoms appear, the typical scarlet fever rash begins.\nThe scarlet fever rash is as bright red as sunburn, and it often has a fine texture like sandpaper (andquot;sandpaper rash\") or gooseflesh (goosebumps). It usually starts in the underarm area, groin and neck, then spreads to the trunk, back, arms and legs. Other symptoms of scarlet fever include:\nOccasionally, scarlet fever follows a streptococcal skin infection, such as an infection of burns or wounds, or impetigo. When this happens, the rash and related skin symptoms appear, but there are no symptoms related to strep throat.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will suspect scarlet fever based on the appearance of your rash and its timing in relation to other symptoms. During the physical examination, your doctor will check for the symptoms of scarlet fever. To confirm the diagnosis of a strep infection, your doctor will take a swab of throat secretions. If no sore throat is present, then the exam will focus on other possible sources of strep infection, such as impetigo.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Although the scarlet fever rash generally fades after 6 to 7 days, it is followed by a period of skin flaking and peeling that lasts for 10 to 14 days. Occasionally, in patients with severe rash, peeling and flaking may persist for a few weeks.\n",
      "Prevention": "The best prevention is thorough hand washing, especially by those who have a sore throat or other symptoms of strep infection. If you live with someone who has a strep infection, and you develop a sore throat or fever, make an appointment with a health care professional.\n",
      "Treatment": "Scarlet fever is treated with antibiotics, usually penicillin or azithromycin. However, other antibiotics may be effective as well.\nIn addition to antibiotic treatment, patients with scarlet fever and severe throat symptoms may try:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly whenever you or someone in your family develops a rash that is accompanied by fever or other symptoms of infection.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, all signs of the scarlet fever rash are gone within two weeks, and there is no long-term scarring. However, because scarlet fever is a strep infection, patients with this illness have the same risk of strep complications (otitis media, pneumonia, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, etc.) as patients without a rash.\n",

      "What is schizophrenia?": "Schizophrenia is a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder that is easily misunderstood. Although symptoms may vary widely, people with schizophrenia frequently have a hard time recognizing reality, thinking logically and behaving naturally in social situations. Schizophrenia is surprisingly common, affecting 1 in every 100 people worldwide.\nExperts believe schizophrenia results from a combination of genetic and environmental causes. The chance of having schizophrenia is 10% if an immediate family member (a parent or sibling) has the illness. The risk is as high as 65% for those who have an identical twin with schizophrenia.\nScientists have identified several genes that increase the risk of getting this illness. In fact, so many problem genes have been investigated that schizophrenia can be seen as several illnesses rather than one. These genes probably affect the way the brain develops and how nerve cells communicate with one another. In a vulnerable person, a stress (such as a toxin, an infection or a nutritional deficiency) may trigger the illness during critical periods of brain development.\nSchizophrenia may start as early as childhood and last throughout life. People with this illness periodically have difficulty with their thoughts and their perceptions. They may withdraw from social contacts. Without treatment, symptoms get worse.\nSchizophrenia is one of several psychotic disorders. Psychosis can be defined as the inability to recognize reality. It may include such symptoms as delusions (false beliefs), hallucinations (false perceptions), and disorganized speech or behavior. Psychosis is a symptom of many mental disorders. In other words, having a psychotic symptomdoes notnecessarily mean a person has schizophrenia.\nSymptoms in schizophrenia are described as either positive or negative. Positive symptoms are psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and disorganized speech. Negative symptoms are the tendency toward restricted emotions, flat affect (diminished emotional expressiveness), and the inability to start or continue productive activity.\nIn addition to positive and negative symptoms, many people with schizophrenia also have cognitive symptoms (problems with their intellectual functioning). They may have trouble with working memory. That is, they have trouble keeping information in mind in order to use it. For example, it may be hard to hold a phone number in memory. These problems can be very subtle, but in many cases may account for why a person with schizophrenia has such a hard time managing day-to-day life.\nSchizophrenia can be marked by a steady deterioration of logical thinking, social skills and behavior. These problems can interfere with personal relationships or functioning at work. Self-care can also suffer.\nAs people with schizophrenia realize what it means to have the disease, they may become depressed or demoralized. People with schizophrenia are therefore at greater than average risk of committing suicide.\nPeople with schizophrenia are also at more risk for developing substance abuse problems. People who drink and use substances have a harder time adhering to treatment. People with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes more than people in the general population. The smoking leads to more health problems.\nAnyone with serious and chronic mental illness is at greater risk for developing metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that increase risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The risk factors include obesity, high blood pressure and abnormal lipid levels in the bloodstream.\nSchizophrenia has historically been divided into several subtypes, but the evidence suggests that these divisions are probably not clinically useful.\n",
      "Symptoms of schizophrenia": "The symptoms of schizophrenia are often defined as either positive or negative.\nPositive symptoms:\nNegative symptoms:\nNegative symptoms may represent a reduced ability to express emotions. People with schizophrenia may also have trouble experiencing pleasure, which may lead to apathy.\nCognitive or intellectual symptoms are harder to detect and include problems retaining and using information for the purpose of organizing or planning.\n",
      "Diagnosing schizophrenia": "The diagnosis of schizophrenia is often not easy to make. It is not possible to make the diagnosis in one meeting. Even if the person has psychotic symptoms, that does not mean he or she has schizophrenia. It may take months or even years to see if the pattern of illness fits the description of schizophrenia.\nJust as there are many causes of fever, there are many causes of psychosis. Part of an evaluation is to check for some of these other causes, for example, a mood disorder, a medical problem or a toxic substance.\nExperts know that brain function is impaired in schizophrenia, but tests that examine the brain directly cannot yet be used to make a diagnosis. Brain imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or an electroencephalogram (EEG), is not diagnostic for schizophrenia. Such exams, however, can help to rule out other possible causes of symptoms, such as a tumor or a seizure disorder.\n",
      "Expected duration of schizophrenia": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness. Psychotic symptoms tend to wax and wane, while the negative symptoms and cognitive problems are more persistent. In general, the impact of the illness can be reduced by early and active treatment.\n",
      "Preventing schizophrenia": "There is no way to prevent schizophrenia, but the earlier the illness is detected, the better chance there is to prevent the worst effects of the illness.\nSchizophrenia is never the parents' fault. But in families where the illness is prevalent, genetic counseling may be helpful before starting a family. Educated family members are often in a better position to understand the illness and provide assistance.\n",
      "Treating schizophrenia": "Schizophrenia requires a combination of treatments, including medication, psychological counseling and social support.\n",
      "Medication": "The major medications used to treat schizophrenia are called antipsychotics. They are generally effective for treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Every person reacts a little differently to antipsychotic drugs, so a patient may need to try several before finding the one that works best.\nIf a medication does help, it is important to continue it even after symptoms get better. Without medication, there is a high likelihood that psychosis will return, and each returning episode may be worse.\nAntipsychotic medications are divided into older (andquot;first generation\") and newer (andquot;second generation\") groups. In recent years, it has been shown that, in general, one group is not more effective than the other, but side effects differ from one group to the other. Also there are differences among the medications within each group. For any individual person with schizophrenia it is impossible to predict which medicine will be best. Therefore, finding the most favorable balance of benefits and side effects depends upon a thoughtful trial and error process.\nPatients who are having a first episode of psychosis are both more responsive to these medicines and are more sensitive to adverse effects. Thus, experts suggest that low to moderate doses be used at the start.\nPeople who suffer a relapse can try any other medication in the first or second generation of antipsychotics. Once a person has found a drug or combination of drugs that helps, it is a good idea to continue maintenance treatment in order to reduce the risk of relapse.\nOlder \"first generation\" antipsychotics.The first antipsychotics developed are also sometimes called \"typical\" (in contrast to \"atypical\") antipsychotics. Examples are chlorpromazine (Thorazine), haloperidol (Haldol) or perphenazine (Trilafon). First generation agents have been shown to be as effective as most newer ones. Side effects can be minimized if modest doses are used. The older drugs tend to be less expensive than the newer ones. The disadvantage of these drugs is the risk of muscle spasms or rigidity, restlessness and — with long-term use — the risk of developing potentially irreversible involuntary muscle movements (called tardive dyskinesia).\nNewer \"atypical\" antipsychotics.These \"second generation\" medications include clozapine (Clozaril), olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), lurasidone (Latuda), and cariprazine (Vraylar), . The major risk with some of these agents is weight gain and changes in metabolism. They tend to increase the risk for diabetes and high cholesterol.\nOther side effects.All antipsychotic medications can cause sedation. One can also feel slowed or unmotivated, or have trouble concentrating, changes in sleep, dry mouth, constipation, or changes in blood pressure.\nClozapine.Clozapine (Clozaril) is a unique antipsychotic. It works so differently from other antipsychotics that it is useful to try if no other medication has provided enough relief. However, since clozapine can impair the body's ability to make white blood cells, anyone taking this drug must have regular blood tests to check those cell counts. Other side effects include changes in heart rate and blood pressure, weight gain, sedation, excessive salivation, and constipation. On the positive side, people tend not to develop the muscle rigidity or the involuntary muscle movements seen with older antipsychotics. For some people, clozapine may be the best overall treatment for schizophrenia symptoms, so they may decide that the potential benefit of taking it is worth the risks.\nBecause other disorders can either mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia or may accompany schizophrenia, other classes of medication may be tried, such as antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Sometimes anti-anxiety medications help to control anxiety or agitation.\n",
      "Psychosocial treatments": "There is growing evidence that psychosocial treatments are essential to the treatment of schizophrenia.These treatments are not given instead of medications; they are given in addition to medications.\nIn other words, the combination of medication and psychosocial treatment is most helpful.\nSeveral approaches are useful:\nPsychotherapy.Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) can reduce symptoms and distress in schizophrenia. CBT in schizophrenia is conducted differently from CBT for depression. When treating schizophrenia, the therapist puts a heavy emphasis on understanding the person's experience, developing a relationship, and explaining psychotic symptoms in realistic terms to defuse their distressing effect.\nAssertive Community Treatment.A community-based team with a variety of caregivers (for example, a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, social worker, and/or case manager) makes frequent contact with patients, monitors treatment adherence, and assesses psychosocial and health needs. The team may also provide emotional support to families. Some patients do well living in housing where staff can monitor progress and provide practical assistance.\nSupported Employment.Such programs rely upon rapid job placement rather than an extensive training period before employment. Programs work hard to honor the person's preferences regarding work. They integrate on-the-job support and mental health services into the program. Most careful studies have found such an approach to be more effective than traditional vocational services.\nFamily Education.Schizophrenia profoundly affects families. Education about the illness and practical advice can reduce relapse rates of patients as well as reduce family distress and help family members support the person suffering with the illness.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment.Substance abuse, which is a common problem in schizophrenia, can make the illness worse. Such treatment is essential when substance problems emerge.\nGeneral Health.Patients with schizophrenia have a higher incidence of smoking and overweight. Thus, a comprehensive program may include a way to help patients with these problems. Examples are smoke-ending advice, weight-loss programs or nutritional counseling.\nThe overall goal of psychosocial treatment is to provide ongoing emotional and practical support, education about the illness, perspective on the symptoms of the illness, advice about managing relationships and health, skills for improved functioning and orientation to reality. There may be an emphasis on sustaining motivation and solving problems. All of these efforts can help a patient stick with treatment. The longer and more trusting the relationships (with a therapist or case manager), the more useful it will be for the person affected by this illness.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Seek treatment for anyone showing psychotic symptoms or having difficulty functioning because of problems in thinking. Although the vast majority of people with this disorder never harm themselves or others, there is some increased risk of suicide or violence in schizophrenia, another reason to seek help. There is increasing evidence that earlier and continuous treatment leads to a better outcome. Plus, a relationship with a team of care providers increases access to new treatments as they become available.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for schizophrenia varies. By definition, schizophrenia is a long-lasting condition that includes some periods of psychosis. Functioning may fall short of expectations, when measured against the person's abilities prior to becoming ill. Poor functioning is, however, not inevitable with early treatment and proper supports.\nLife expectancy may be shortened if a person with schizophrenia drifts away from supportive relationships, if personal hygiene or self-care decline, or if poor judgment leads to accidents. However, with active treatment, the effects of the illness can be significantly reduced.\nThe prognosis is better if the first symptoms began after age 30 and if the onset was rapid. Better functioning before the onset of illness is linked to better responses to treatment. The absence of a family history of schizophrenia is also a good sign.\n",

      "What is scleritis?": "Scleritis is a potentially serious inflammation of the sclera, commonly called the white of the eye. It is the tough, white tissue that gives the eye its shape and protects the eye. More than 50% of cases of scleritis are associated with another disease that affects the whole body, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or are caused by infection or injury. Scleritis occurs most often in people ages 30 to 60 and is rare in children. If left untreated, the condition can spread to parts of other parts of the eye. Some visual loss could then occur.\n",
      "Symptoms of scleritis": "The main symptoms of scleritis are pain and redness in the white part of the eye. These symptoms usually develop gradually and eventually become severe. The redness may become an intense purple. Many people with scleritis have pain radiating from the eye to adjacent areas of the head and face. Commonly, the eye becomes teary and very sensitive to light. You may lose some vision.\n",
      "Diagnosing scleritis": "Your eye doctor will ask you about your medical history and conduct a thorough examination. In addition, because of the association between scleritis and other general medical conditions, your doctor may suggest a comprehensive medical examination, including blood counts and other tests and evaluations. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a biopsy may be used to rule out other causes of symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration of scleritis": "Depending on its cause, scleritis should begin to clear up fairly quickly once treatment begins.\n",
      "Preventing scleritis": "Scleritis may be prevented by avoiding eye injuries (for example, by wearing protective eyewear) or by having an associated condition (such as rheumatoid arthritis) well treated.\n",
      "Treating scleritis": "Scleritis should be treated promptly to help avoid complications and vision loss. When related to an underlying disease, treatment of the disease may control the inflammation of the eye. Drugs used to treat scleritis include a corticosteroid solution that you apply directly to your eye, an oral corticosteroid (prednisone), and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Additional immune suppressing medications (such as cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, rituximab, or cyclophosphamide) may be needed for severe cases not responding to corticosteroids, or when the required doses of corticosteroids are high. In severe cases, surgery may be required to repair injured areas of the eyeball.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should call your doctor immediately if your eye is painful and red.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Mild scleritis that is promptly diagnosed and treated has an excellent prognosis. Complications are common with more severe scleritis. These include glaucoma, damage to the cornea, cataracts, retinal detachment, and, rarely, perforation of the globe (eyeball). Vision loss may accompany any these complications.\n",

      "What is scleroderma?": "Scleroderma is a poorly understood illness that causes widespread hardening of the skin, especially on the hands and face. It also can damage the lungs, heart, kidneys, digestive tract, muscles, and joints. It is a long-lasting (chronic) autoimmune disorder, an illness in which the body's immune defenses mistakenly attack the body's own cells rather than protecting them from outside invaders. Scleroderma also is called progressive systemic sclerosis.\n\nThere are two types of scleroderma. In thelimited form, also called limited systemic sclerosis, the skin is the primary target. In thediffuse form(diffuse systemic sclerosis), the damage not only affects the skin, but also can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other internal organs.\nIn people with scleroderma, scientists have identified abnormal immune proteins called autoantibodies, which are programmed to attack specific components of body cells. They also have found abnormal accumulations of protective T cells (white blood cells that are part of the immune system) in the skin and elsewhere.\nAlthough scientists don't understand exactly what happens, they believe that the immune system, perhaps involving these autoantibodies or T cells, somehow damages the body's smallest arteries, called arterioles. These damaged arterioles leak fluid, which causes swelling. They also release chemical factors that stimulate cells called fibroblasts to produce too much collagen, a fibrous protein involved in forming scar tissue.\nIn the skin, this leads to thickening, hardening, and tightness. Elsewhere in the body, the autoimmune attack of scleroderma can damage the digestive tract, the linings of joints, the outside sheaths of tendons, muscles (including the heart muscle), portions of the heart that regulate heart rhythm, the small blood vessels, and the kidneys.\nScleroderma is rare, affecting about 14 in every 1 million people worldwide. It is most common in women ages 35 to 54. The cause is unknown. For some reason, cells called fibroblasts make too much scar-type tissue in the skin and in organs throughout the body.\nA number of theories have been proposed to explain this, including abnormalities in blood vessel function, abnormal proteins and antibodies in the circulation, and abnormal amounts of chemical messengers instructing fibroblasts to become overly active. Because scleroderma is more common in women during the childbearing years, researchers have looked for a pregnancy-related factor to explain why scleroderma develops. One theory suggests that leftover fetal cells can still be circulating in the mother's bloodstream decades after pregnancy, and may play some role in triggering the autoimmune changes behind scleroderma. Genetic factors and infectious triggers have also been proposed.\nOlder studies have linked scleroderma to exposure to certain chemicals, including vinyl chloride, epoxy resins, aromatic hydrocarbons, and ingestion of rapeseed oil adulterated with aniline. Some people who took tryptophan, an amino acid that used to be sold as a dietary supplement, developed a condition similar to scleroderma called eosinophilia myalgia syndrome. Since tryptophan was removed from the market, no further cases of eosinophilia myalgia syndrome have been reported. But the clear link between tryptophan and eosinophilia myalgia syndrome and the scleroderma-like disease associated with contaminated rapeseed oil ingestion raise the possibility that exposure to something in the environment could trigger scleroderma.\n",
      "Symptoms of scleroderma": "The symptoms of scleroderma vary from person to person and can include:\nMore than 95% of people with scleroderma have both Raynaud's phenomenon and skin thickening (also called sclerodactyly when the fingers are involved). In addition, those with limited scleroderma tend to have telangiectasias, a collection of dilated blood vessels under the skin (85% of patients); digestive problems involving the esophagus (80%); and calcinosis (50%), often called CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's, esophageal disease, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia). High pressure in the blood vessels around the lung (a serious condition called pulmonary hypertension) develops in about 15% of people with limited scleroderma.\nBesides having Raynaud's phenomenon and skin thickening, people with the diffuse form of scleroderma can have digestive symptoms involving the esophagus (80%), joint symptoms (70%), muscle weakness (50%), lung symptoms (40%), and heart failure (30%).\n",
      "Diagnosing scleroderma": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and will examine your skin, especially on your fingers, hands, and face. If your doctor suspects you have scleroderma, he or she may want to order blood and urine tests. Occasionally, a skin biopsy may be recommended, during which a small sample of skin is removed and examined in a laboratory. If scleroderma affects internal organs such as the heart, lungs, or digestive organs, a chest x-ray and other tests may be necessary.\n",
      "Expected duration of scleroderma": "Scleroderma is a chronic (long-lasting) disease. Although symptoms may come and go over time, the various forms of this disease usually last a lifetime. The skin swelling that happens first can last for a few weeks or months. This is followed by a gradual thickening of the skin and other skin changes. In the diffuse form of the disease, skin symptoms tend to peak within three years, then stabilize or even improve. If skin changes occur more rapidly, there is often a greater risk that internal organs are being damaged as well. In limited scleroderma, skin symptoms tend to worsen very slowly over a period of many years.\n",
      "Preventing scleroderma": "There is no way to prevent scleroderma.\n",
      "Treating scleroderma": "There is currently no single treatment for scleroderma that is reliably effective. Treatment choices depend on the organ involved, other medications and medical problems, and patient preference.\nA host of drugs are commonly prescribed and may have benefit. Among the most commonly prescribed drugs for scleroderma are:\nOther immune-suppressing medications that are sometimes recommended for scleroderma include azathioprine, tocilizumab, or rituximab. A promising experimental therapy for severe disease is high-dose immunosuppression with stem cell treatment, although serious side effects (including overwhelming infection and heart problems) have limited its use. When lung or kidney disease is severe and does not respond to treatment, organ transplant may be recommended.\nMany patients find relief from Raynaud's phenomenon with nonmedication approaches such as limiting their exposure to cold and by wearing warm clothing, especially mittens and socks. Others find that regular exercise, physical therapy, skin massage, and moisturizing ointments help skin symptoms. If dry skin becomes ulcerated and infected, antibiotics may be needed. In addition, patients with Raynaud's phenomenon are urged not to smoke and to avoid street drugs and certain prescription drugs, including beta blockers, amphetamines, cocaine, and ergotamine (Ergomar and other brand names).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you think that you are experiencing episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon or other symptoms of scleroderma, especially if you are a woman of childbearing age.\n",
      "Prognosis": "While many people with scleroderma live long, full lives, the death rate is increased by up to eight times for diffuse disease and two times for limited disease. Pulmonary hypertension and diffuse skin disease are risk factors for poor prognosis. However, longevity in this illness seems to be improving over time. Its rarity and variability make it difficult to accurately predict the prognosis in an individual with scleroderma.\n",

      "What is it?": "A normal spine has several front-to-back curves between the neck and the pelvis. In scoliosis, the spine curves abnormally to the side or twists. Although scoliosis seems to run in some families, most cases appear for unknown reasons in children and adolescents who previously had a straight spine. Scoliosis without a known cause is called idiopathic scoliosis. Girls and boys are affected equally by idiopathic scoliosis, but girls with this condition are more likely to develop curves that get big enough to require treatment.\nIn some cases, the cause of scoliosis is known. These include:\nScoliosis is a long-term (chronic) disease that can worsen over time. Sometimes a curved spine that develops during infancy or early childhood may go unnoticed and untreated until the teenage years. The abnormal position of the spine can affect the development of muscles and ligaments associated with the spinal column, causing the ribs and pelvis also to twist and rotate to the side.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Normally, when you look at a person's spine from the front or back, it appears straight. When a person has scoliosis, the spine typically curves out to one side and then back again, or, more commonly, has two bowed-out areas that balance each other, resembling an S shape. Other signs can include\nMost people with scoliosis are not bothered by it other than abnormal posture and cosmetic concerns. If scoliosis is severe and untreated, it can cause additional problems, including:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Starting at age 8 or 10, most children and adolescents are checked for scoliosis at each routine physical examination. Many states require public schools to screen students for scoliosis, usually in the fifth or sixth grade. During the exam, the health professional will ask the child to stand up straight, then bend over and try to touch his or her toes. This bent-over position allows the examiner to check for curvature in the spine, for an abnormal body tilt to the left or right, or for one shoulder blade that is raised higher than the other. The overall value of routine screening is not clear.\nIf your child's school nurse or your family doctor suspects scoliosis, he or she may refer you to a spine specialist, usually an orthopedic surgeon (a specialist who treats diseases of the bones and joints), for further examination. To help with the diagnosis, a series of spinal X-rays often will be taken. Using these X-rays, the specialist will determine the severity of the scoliosis and the risk that it will worsen. Once this is done, the doctor will recommend specific treatment.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Scoliosis is a lifelong condition that usually begins in childhood or adolescence. Once rapid bone growth ends after puberty, scoliosis usually does not worsen. As the spine undergoes normal weakening in adulthood, curvatures and symptoms can worsen gradually.\n",
      "Prevention": "Except for osteoporosis-related scoliosis, most cases of scoliosis cannot be prevented. There is no evidence to suggest that improving posture or doing exercises can prevent it. Measures to increase bone mass and strengthen bones, including getting enough calcium and vitamin D, doing regular weight-bearing exercise, and, taking bone-building medications may help to prevent cases caused by spinal fractures. In some cases, early detection may prevent the condition from getting worse.\nYou should examine your child's spine regularly, starting in infancy, and talk to a health care professional about any concerns. School nurse evaluations and regular pediatric examinations also can identify cases of scoliosis.\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of scoliosis depends on the patient's age and sex, the severity of spinal curvature, the location of the curve, the type of scoliosis, and in girls, whether the patient has started to menstruate. The age at which menstruation begins is an indicator of the stage of bone growth, which helps determine the risk that the disease will progress.\nMost cases of scoliosis are mild and require no treatment. However, to make sure that the curve does not get worse, the person should be examined regularly by a doctor. More severe cases that cause discomfort or other symptoms and mild cases that are likely to get worse often require treatment, which may include back-strengthening exercises. For the worst cases of scoliosis, special back braces and even surgery may be recommended.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your child's doctor for a thorough exam if you notice that your child has any signs of scoliosis or if an abnormal curve in the spine was detected during a school screening program.\n",
      "Prognosis": "When scoliosis is detected early, treatment usually can prevent the problem from getting worse. Most cases of scoliosis are mild and cause no discomfort or physical limitations. In extreme cases that require surgery, the patient usually recovers quickly. Although most people with mild scoliosis can continue normal activities, some people are advised to avoid heavy contact sports or gymnastics. Your doctor will discuss any specific activity limitations with you. Without treatment, severe scoliosis can cause significant deformity and some pain or breathing problems in adult years.\n",

      "Treating a sebaceous cyst": "A sebaceous cyst usually does not need to be treated unless it is inflamed (red) or is causing a cosmetic problem. Inflamed cysts usually are treated by draining the fluid and removing the shell that make up the cyst wall. You also may be treated with antibiotics if the skin around the cyst is infected. If a cyst is causing irritation or cosmetic difficulty, your physician can remove it by making a small incision in the skin and emptying the contents of the cyst and its wall.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have a new swelling on your skin that lasts for more than two weeks, contact your doctor, especially if it is painful.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for sebaceous cysts is excellent. Many cysts have no symptoms and some will go away on their own. Cysts can return. If your cyst is problematic, your doctor may decide to drain it or remove it surgically. This does not usually lead to any complications or side effects.\n",

      "What is it?": "Seborrheic dermatitis is a form of skin inflammation (dermatitis) that causes a red, oily, flaking skin rash in areas of the body where glands in the skin called sebaceous glands are most abundant — the scalp, face and groin. In infants, it primarily affects the scalp, where it is called cradle cap. The causes of seborrheic dermatitis are unclear, but yeast may be involved in some cases.\n\nAlthough doctors recognize that seborrheic dermatitis occurs in skin areas that have many sebaceous glands, they still do not know exactly why it develops there. It is thought that a tiny yeast may play a role in seborrheic dermatitis. Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin disorder that affects people who often have no other health problems.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In infants, seborrheic dermatitis appears as a scaly redness that usually is not itchy or uncomfortable. In some babies, it affects only the scalp (cradle cap), but in others, it also involves the neck creases, armpits or groin.\nIn adults and adolescents, seborrheic dermatitis may affect only the scalp, appearing as either patchy or diffuse areas of redness and flaking. Other skin areas commonly affected include the eyebrows, eyelids, forehead, nose creases, outer ear, chest, underarms, or groin. Although some adults and adolescents feel an itchy or burning irritation in areas of seborrheic dermatitis, others don't have any discomfort. In some people, seborrheic dermatitis flare-ups are triggered by stress.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor usually can diagnose seborrheic dermatitis by a simple physical examination.\n",
      "Expected duration": "In infants, seborrheic dermatitis typically is worst during the first year of life. It usually disappears on its own as the child grows, and it may return during the teenage years. In adults and adolescents, seborrheic dermatitis tends to be a chronic condition that comes and goes over many years.\n",
      "Prevention": "Because doctors do not know what causes seborrheic dermatitis, there is no way to prevent it. However, symptoms can be controlled with effective treatment.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have an infant with cradle cap, your doctor may suggest applying baby oil to soften the scale, followed by shampooing with a mild baby shampoo to gently remove the scale. If this doesn't help, your doctor may recommend an anti-seborrheic dermatitis shampoo. For skin areas outside the scalp, your doctor may prescribe hydrocortisone or an anti-yeast cream, because yeast sometimes can trigger seborrheic dermatitis.\nIf you are an adult with scalp seborrheic dermatitis, your doctor may suggest a shampoo containing selenium sulfide or zinc pyrithione. Your doctor also may prescribe corticosteroid cream and shampoo containing ketoconazole. For other skin areas, hydrocortisone or anti-yeast cream can be rubbed directly into seborrheic dermatitis patches.\nFor adults with persistent seborrheic dermatitis, treatment with oral itraconazole 200 mg daily for 7 days, and then the same dose for the first 2 days of each month can be very effective. Usually the treatment is only needed for 3 months.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have not been able to control your seborrheic dermatitis with shampoos and creams. Remember, the goal is control. There is no cure.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Cradle cap typically disappears on its own as a child grows. Other forms of seborrheic dermatitis usually respond very well to topical treatment with medicated shampoos and/or creams. When needed, an oral anti-fungal medicine can be very effective.\n",

      "What is it?": "Seborrheic keratoses are benign (noncancerous) skin growths that develop from skin cells called keratinocytes. These growths have a waxy or greasy look and can be tan, brown or black. They look like they have been glued or stuck onto the skin. Over time, the growths become rough and crusty looking.\n\nSeborrheic keratoses usually appear alone, but others may develop. They usually are found on the chest and back but can appear anywhere on the body, including the face, scalp and neck.\nNo one knows what causes seborrheic keratoses, but they become more common with age. Most people will develop some seborrheic keratoses as they get older, and children rarely have them. Seborrheic keratoses are not contagious.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Seborrheic keratoses look like crusty growths on the skin that typically start out tan or brown but can darken over time. They tend to have a greasy appearance and look as though they were glued onto the skin, as opposed to growing from it. They may be tiny, or larger than 3 inches across. They rarely itch.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Physicians usually can diagnose seborrheic keratoses by looking at them. In rare cases, seborrheic keratoses may look like other skin disorders, including malignant melanoma. If the diagnosis is uncertain, your physician may want to do a biopsy, in which a portion of the growth is removed and examined under a microscope.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Seborrheic keratoses do not go away on their own. If they are not removed, they will last a lifetime.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent seborrheic keratoses from developing.\n",
      "Treatment": "Seborrheic keratoses do not require treatment. Although they may grow relatively large and can become dark, they are not dangerous.\nIf seborrheic keratoses become irritated, itchy or unsightly or if they bleed, they can be removed in a doctor's office. Because the skin is numbed before any procedure, treatment is mostly painless. The three main methods of removal are:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See a health care professional if you develop any unusual skin growths or if existing growths start to change their appearance. If multiple seborrheic keratoses develop suddenly, call your physician's office to schedule an appointment. It may be a sign of another disease.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Seborrheic keratoses do not go away on their own, but they can be removed if they become irritating or unsightly. There is no harm in not treating the growths, because they are benign (noncancerous) and do not become cancerous.\n",

      "What is it?": "Most people with high blood pressure are diagnosed with primary hypertension. Currently this means that no specific cause is identified for the condition.  Some of the time, however, high blood pressure is caused by another condition or disease. When this happens, it is called secondary hypertension.\nSome of the medical problems that can cause secondary hypertension include:\nThree different types of adrenal gland conditions cause high blood pressure:\nOther rare causes of secondary hypertension include:\nHigh blood pressure may be a side effect of medication, such as hormonal contraceptives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs).\n",
      "Symptoms": "New guidelines define high blood pressure as persistent readings of 130/80 mm Hg. However, people with secondary hypertension will be diagnosed when they have readings of at least 14/90 mm Hg. Most often doctors start to consider secondary hypertension when blood pressure is not controlled with two or three different medications or if the person has symptoms related to the underlying condition.\nFor example, a tumor of the adrenal gland called a pheochromocytoma can cause sweating, palpitations, severe anxiety and weight loss. In Cushing's syndrome, there may be weight gain, weakness, abnormal growth of body hair and loss of menstrual periods in women, and the appearance of purple \"stretch marks\" on the abdomen (abdominal striae). Hyperparathyroidism with elevated calcium levels can cause fatigue, increased urination, constipation and kidney stones. Hyperaldosteronism often causes weakness related to low blood potassium levels.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "You doctor will ask you if you have any symptoms related to the medical illnesses that cause secondary hypertension. During a physical examination, your doctor will pay special attention to any sudden weight gain or weight loss, signs of extra fluid in your tissues, abnormal hair growth, and purple marks on your abdomen. You doctor also will check your abdomen for any abnormal masses, and he or she will use a stethoscope to listen for sounds of abnormal blood flow in your kidneys.\nDepending on the results of your physical examination, your doctor will order additional tests to pinpoint the cause of your secondary hypertension. For suspected kidney disease, these tests may include blood tests for creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinalysis, and an ultrasound examination of your abdomen to evaluate the size of your kidneys. If there is concern that you may have renal artery stenosis, your doctor may order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Occasionally, a test called a renal arteriogram is ordered.\nFor pheochromocytoma, your urine or blood may be analyzed for levels of catecholamines (the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine). For Cushing's syndrome, urine or blood levels of cortisol are measured. For hyperparathyroidism, blood levels of parathormone, calcium and phosphate are measured. For hyperaldosteronism, blood tests for potassium and aldosterone levels are measured.\nCoarctation of the aorta usually is suspected based on the younger age of the person, physical exam findings (blood pressure in the arms much higher than blood pressure in the legs) and specific changes seen on chest X-ray.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Secondary hypertension will last as long as the medical problem that is causing it remains untreated.\n",
      "Prevention": "Most of the medical problems that cause secondary hypertension can't be prevented. This makes secondary hypertension different from primary hypertension, which can be prevented by exercising regularly, restricting salt, following a healthy diet, watching your weight and avoiding smoking.\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of secondary hypertension depends on its cause. When secondary hypertension results from a tumor or a blood vessel abnormality, surgery may be recommended. However, the decision to do surgery is often guided by the age and general health of the patient. For some patients, anti-hypertensive medications may be a safer option than surgery.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Inform you doctor if you have any of the symptoms associated with medical illnesses that cause secondary hypertension, such as unexplained weight change, palpitations, leg swelling (edema), marked fatigue, abnormal hair growth or new purplish stretch marks on your skin.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In many patients with secondary hypertension, high blood pressure can be cured when their underlying medical illness is treated successfully.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Sedative-hypnotic drugs — sometimes called \"depressants\" — and anxiolytic (antianxiety) drugs slow down the activity of the brain. Benzodiazepines (Ativan, Halcion, Librium, Valium, Xanax, Rohypnol) are the best known. An older class of drugs, called barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital) fit into this broad category. Other drugs in this group include chloral hydrate (which when mixed with alcohol was once known as \"knockout drops\" or a \"Mickey Finn\"), glutethimide, methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor, \"ludes\") and meprobamate (Equanil, Miltown and other brand names).\nAlcohol has some properties similar to the above drugs, but alcohol is so common that health experts classify alcohol-related problems separately.\nRegular use of these drugs often leads to \"drug tolerance.\" That is, the body adjusts to them and it takes a higher and higher dose to achieve the desired effect. Dependence also can develop, meaning withdrawal symptoms will occur if the drug is suddenly stopped.\nMany of these drugs have legitimate uses. Benzodiazepines are a good treatment for anxiety and are also useful in sleep disorders. Barbiturates are used to treat seizures and for anesthesia during major surgery.\nIn particular, using barbiturates to get \"high\" can be very dangerous. There is a relatively small difference between the desired dose and an overdose. A small miscalculation, which is easy to make, can lead to coma, respiratory distress (breathing slows or stops) and death. Withdrawal from barbiturates is similar to, and sometimes more severe than, alcohol withdrawal. Seizures are possible and can also lead to death.\nCompared to barbiturates, benzodiazepines are much safer. They cause sedation but rarely interfere with a person's breathing or cause death. They have the potential to be psychologically harmful by causing over-sedation, memory impairment, poor motor coordination and confusion. Withdrawal reactions can be extremely uncomfortable, although they usually are not deadly.\nCombining any of these drugs, or using them with alcohol, can lead to dangerous effects. People often take these combinations to try to boost the feeling of intoxication or to counter unpleasant effects of other street drugs.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of dependence on sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drugs:\nThere is no absolute dose or number of pills per day that indicates a person is dependent on sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drugs. People with drug dependence eventually develop physical tolerance (the gradual need for greater amounts of the drug to feel the same effects). But addiction implies that the person is also craving the drug's effect or relying on the drug for a reason other than the intended therapeutic uses of the drug.\nIf the person suddenly stops taking the drug, the body's accustomed internal environment changes drastically, causing symptoms of withdrawal: anxiety, tremors, nightmares, insomnia, poor appetite, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, blood pressure abnormalities, dangerously high fever and seizures. With short-acting medications — pentobarbital (Nembutal), secobarbital (Seconal), alprazolam (Xanax), meprobamate (Miltown, Equanil), methaqualone (Quaalude) — withdrawal symptoms begin 12 to 24 hours after the last dose and peak at 24 to 72 hours. With longer-acting medications — phenobarbital, diazepam (Valium), or chlordiazepoxide (Librium) — withdrawal symptoms begin 24 to 48 hours after the last dose and peak within 5 to 8 days.\nAs with alcohol, sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drugs can cause symptoms during intoxication. These symptoms can include slurred speech, problems with coordination or walking, inattention, and memory difficulties. In extreme cases, the person may lapse into a stupor or coma.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If your doctor suspects that you are addicted to sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drugs, he or she will ask you questions about the type of drugs you use, the amount you take, how often you use them, how long you've been using them and under what circumstances. Your doctor also will ask you about physical symptoms, psychological problems or behavioral difficulties (impaired work performance, problems in your personal relationships, criminal arrests) related to your drug use.\nIf you are using any other substances (for example, alcohol, heroin, amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana) in addition to sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drugs, it is helpful for your doctor to know this.\nOf course, it is difficult to talk frankly about substance use with your doctor or a counselor. You may not be sure you want to get help. However, an open accounting of drug use leads to more effective planning. The goal is not just to get through detoxification safely, but also to establish a treatment plan that helps to reduce craving for the drug and to solve the underlying problem that led to the addiction, such as anxiety, depression or stressful circumstances.\nYour doctor can diagnose dependence on one of these drugs based on your history, including your pattern of drug use and its effect on your life and health. In some cases, especially if you have symptoms of intoxication or withdrawal, your doctor may find additional evidence for the diagnosis in your physical examination. Your doctor may also want to screen your urine or blood.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Depressant addiction can be a long-term problem that lasts for years.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent problems, follow any prescription directions exactly and avoid taking more of the medication than your doctor ordered. The biological, psychological and social forces that lead to addiction, however, are difficult to prevent. If you feel that you need the medication for longer than prescribed, consult your doctor immediately. Never take medication that has been prescribed for anyone else.\n",
      "Treatment": "The first goal of treatment is detoxification (withdrawal from the drug). Detoxification usually involves gradually reducing the dose of the drug or temporarily substituting a medication that has less serious withdrawal symptoms. The substitute medication, if used, also will be reduced gradually. Depending on the severity of the drug dependence and other factors (significant heart or lung disease, liver failure, high blood pressure, a person's age and general health status), detoxification may need to take place in the hospital.\nAll addictions are complex and have multiple causes. A drug use disorder is usually not an isolated problem. Commonly, people with sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drug addictions are also struggling with other mental disorders, such as anxiety or depression.\nThus, treatment is best tailored to the multiple needs of the individual. This should begin with a comprehensive evaluation (medical, psychological and social) to identify the variety of troubles that are fueling the drug use.\nCounseling, behavioral therapies, and group programs (such as 12-step or rational recovery) can help a person address the addiction. Medications or psychotherapy can address craving or habits that could lead to relapse. They also are helpful for other symptoms or problems that are discovered in the course of evaluation and treatment.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "It is best to seek help as soon as possible. Like alcoholism, sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drug use disorder is a real illness, not a sign of weakness or poor character.\nSometimes, if an addiction has caused problems at home, at work, or with the law, an external push from family, employers, or the criminal justice system can further motivate an addiction sufferer to seek treatment.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drug use disorder is difficult to shake without support and without treatment for the root causes.\nWithdrawal is likely to be safe when the dose of the substance is reduced gradually. People who develop withdrawal symptoms that get bad enough to require hospitalization have a 2% to 5% risk of death, a rate similar to severe alcohol withdrawal. However, most people get help before reaching that stage.\nSince it is easy to overdo it with some of these drugs, the risk of accidental overdose is significant.\nIn general, formal treatment is likely to reduce the risk of relapse (or returning to the addictive behavior).\n",

      "What are STDs?": "Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections that are spread from person to person through sexual contact, including oral sex, anal sex and the sharing of sex toys. These diseases can be passed through any contact between the genitals of one person and the genitals, anus, mouth or eyes of another person.\nThere are many different STDs, but the most common ones in the United States are herpes simplex virus type II (genital herpes), human papilloma virus, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV and genital warts. Some infections that can be spread by sex, such as the hepatitis B virus, are not traditionally referred to as STDs because they are spread primarily by other means.\n",
      "Symptoms of STDs": "Symptoms vary depending on the type of infection, although some people who become infected with an STD may not develop symptoms at all.\nSome symptoms of STDs include:\n",
      "Diagnosing STDs": "If your doctor suspects that you may be infected with an STD, he or she will ask how many sexual partners you have had and if any of them have had an STD.\nThen, your doctor will examine you, focusing on your genital area. He or she also will examine your anal area and in women, do a pelvic exam. In addition, your doctor may swab the tip of the penis in men, take a sample of any cervical discharge in women or take a sample from the rectum. The specimens are sent to a laboratory for testing. Similar measures may be done with any visible sores.\nYour doctor may make a preliminary diagnosis based on the results of your physical examination. For example, painful sores would suggest genital herpes, whereas painless ulcers may indicate syphilis. In this way, you can begin treatment for your infection as soon as possible, even before results of laboratory tests are available.\nDifferent tests will be done depending on your symptoms. In the case of genital herpes, if you have an ulcer, it might be swabbed and tested in the lab. Blood tests can also be done to see if you have antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) against the herpes virus, which would indicate that you have been infected at some time in the past.\nTo test for chlamydia infections, your doctor will send a sample of fluid from the tip of the penis or cervix. Chlamydia can also be diagnosed with a urine test.\nGonorrhea requires a direct sample from the tip of the penis, cervix or rectum. Syphilis and HIV can be confirmed with a blood test. If you have an ulcer from syphilis, the diagnosis can be confirmed by looking at fluid from the ulcer under a special darkfield microscope to see if the bacteria are present.\nIf you have one STD, your doctor probably will recommend that you get tested for HIV and other STDs, because the risk factors are similar. Also, you are more likely to get HIV if you are infected with another STD.\n",
      "Expected duration of STDs": "How long STDs last depends on the specific type of infection. In some cases, although symptoms may go away without treatment, the patient is still infected and can pass the STD to a partner during unprotected sexual activity. In patients with trichomoniasis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea, treatment with antibiotics can dramatically shorten the duration of symptoms. In addition, treatment for chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis will avoid potential long-term complications. Viral infections, such as genital warts, genital herpes and HIV cannot be cured. However, they can be treated with medications.\n",
      "Preventing STDs": "You can help to prevent STDs by:\nRemember, although condoms can help reduce your exposure to STDs, they are not foolproof.\nPeople who are diagnosed with an STD may be contacted by their local health department so that their sex partners can be evaluated and treated.\nMost physicians urge patients to tell their sex partners if they have an STD so that their partners can seek medical attention.\nThis is done for two reasons. First, some STDs are fairly silent infections and can be passed unnoticed between sex partners. For example, chlamydia may not cause symptoms in all those infected; however, the scarring effect of the bacteria can lead to infertility, especially in women. Second, STDs are seen as threats to public health. With proper identification and treatment, the rates of infection can be reduced.\nIf you develop frequent outbreaks of genital ulcers from herpes, you can take a low dose of antiviral medication each day to decrease your risk of developing repeat episodes. This will also decrease the risk of transmitting the infection to your partner. However, you can still pass on the infection, so condoms and safe sexual practices remain the best way to avoid potential herpes infection.\n",
      "Treating STDs": "The treatment of STDs depends on the infection. In the case of gonorrhea and chlamydia, your doctor will usually give an antibiotic injection to treat gonorrhea and oral antibiotics to treat chlamydia.\nGenital herpes is a lifelong infection with no cure. However, the blistering skin sores won't last as long if you treat genital herpes with an oral antiviral medication as soon as symptoms of an attack occur. If you have frequent attacks, you should ask your doctor for a prescription for an antiviral medication, such as famciclovir (Famvir) or valacyclovir (Valtrex) so that you will have it when you need it. Taking antiviral medicine every day may reduce the frequency of attacks by 80 percent in people who have frequent episodes of severe genital herpes.\nSyphilis usually is treated with one or more injections of penicillin. Genital warts can be treated by freezing or by applying topical agents. Also your doctor may prescribe an immune boosting cream to help fight the virus.\nHIV cannot be cured, but it can be treated with a drug combination called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART medications must be taken every day for the rest of your life. However, this drug combination has turned HIV from a fatal illness into a treatable, chronic disease.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you find a sore in your genital area or if you notice an abnormal discharge from your urethra or vagina. You should also call your doctor if your sex partner has had an STD, even if you have no symptoms.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most STDs respond well to treatment. However, many patients develop repeat episodes of STDs because their sex partners are not treated or because they continue to be exposed to STDs through unprotected sex. To help avoid getting the same disease again, sex partners usually need treatment as well.\nGenital herpes cannot be cured, because the virus remains dormant in nerves for the rest of a patient's life. However, many people do not notice any problems after the initial infection, and many people don't even notice when they are first infected. In people who do notice herpes flare-ups, about 40 percent of them experience more than six flare-ups over a lifetime; whereas less than 10% have more than 6 flare-ups a year. In patients with herpes simplex virus type II, antiviral therapy can successfully suppress repeated episodes of genital ulcers.\nHIV cannot be cured. But with regular medical attention, monitoring and treatment, most people with HIV live for many years with minimal or no symptoms.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Shigellosis is an infection of the colon (large intestine) caused byShigellabacteria. Shigellosis is also called bacillary dysentery because it can cause severe diarrhea. However, the infection often causes only mild symptoms.\nShigellacan be found in water polluted with infected sewage. Bacteria commonly enter the body through a contaminated drinking supply.Shigellabacteria also can be found on food that has been rinsed with unclean water, grown in fields contaminated with sewage, or touched by flies that have touched feces.Shigellabacteria can reach the mouth on dirty fingers that have touched items soiled with feces, including dirty diapers, toilets and bathroom fixtures.\nOutbreaks of shigellosis are most common in areas where sanitation is poor, and in places where people live under confined or crowded conditions.Shigellaalso can be passed from person to person during anal-oral sex.\nShigellosis is more common among children ages 1 to 4. Children of this age have a higher rate of infection because they are starting to use the toilet and often forget to wash their hands. Infants are at the highest risk of becoming seriously ill from aShigellainfection.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Although health experts don't know why, some people take in Shigella bacteria without becoming ill. Others develop only a brief fever, or a brief fever with mild diarrhea that goes away on its own. About 25% of patients, however, develop high fever, abdominal cramping and severe diarrhea that can contain blood, mucus and pus. These people can have 10 to 30 bowel movements each day, along with a persistent urge to have a bowel movement.\nRarely, Shigella bacteria can affect other parts of the body far from the digestive tract. When this happens, there may be a rash, joint pain, confusion and/or kidney failure.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and about the appearance of your bowel movements. He or she will ask if you have recently traveled to developing countries, been in contact with people who have severe diarrhea, or might have been exposed to contaminated pools, lakes or food.\nYour doctor will diagnose shigellosis based on a physical examination and the results of laboratory tests. These tests include taking a swab of your rectum or a sample of your stool (feces). If you have signs of dehydration (excessive loss of body water) or significant blood loss, additional blood tests may be necessary.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "In most otherwise healthy people with mild shigellosis, diarrhea goes away on its own within five to seven days. However, in very young children, the elderly or people with chronic illnesses, shigellosis can be severe and can lead to life-threatening dehydration and other complications within a few days.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no vaccine to protect against shigellosis. To prevent the spread ofShigellabacteria, you should:\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have a mild case of shigellosis, you probably won't need treatment because your symptoms will probably go away on their own. Doctors may prescribe antibiotics if there are very young or very old members in your household who could get the infection.\nIf you have a severe case of shigellosis, your doctor will prescribe fluids to treat dehydration and an antibiotic. Many strains of Shigella have developed resistance to multiple antibiotics. Your doctor will choose an antibiotic based on how and where you became infected.\nThe use of antidiarrheal medicines to slow bowel movements is controversial because it can take longer to clear the bacteria from the lower intestine. This could potentially cause the infection to become more severe.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call your doctor if you develop severe diarrhea, especially if the bowel movements contain blood or mucus. Call your doctor whenever you have a fever and severe diarrhea. Seek immediate attention if you have signs of dehydration, such as very dry mouth and lips, and lightheadedness when you stand, whether or not you are thirsty.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In developed countries, most people with shigellosis recover completely. In underdeveloped countries, the risk of complications, including death, is significantly higher.\n",

      "What is it?": "Shin splints are injuries that commonly occur in runners. They cause pain along the inner side of the shinbone (tibia).\nShin splints develop because of overuse of the posterior tibialis muscle in the lower leg near the shin. In most cases, this overuse is related to a sudden increase in the intensity of an athlete's training program — suddenly running faster, farther or for longer periods than before. When shin splints first appear, the leg pain tends to start near the end of a training session. However, if the athlete ignores the pain and tries to \"run through it,\" symptoms eventually will begin earlier and earlier during training, until they affect the athlete's overall performance.\nAlthough shin splints are most common in runners, they also can occur in basketball players, soccer players and other athletes in sports that require periods of intense or prolonged running. Even walkers are at risk if they walk too fast or too far.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Shin splints cause muscle pain and tenderness along the inner side of the lower shin. These symptoms tend to affect about 2 to 6 inches of muscle and tendon in the shin area. Pain usually continues after exercise ends, and you may even feel it when you are resting and not putting weight on the affected leg.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask whether you play a sport that requires a lot of running or brisk walking and whether you recently increased your training intensity. Also, your doctor will ask about the timing of your pain in relation to your training sessions and whether pain continues when you are at rest.\nYour doctor usually can diagnose shin splints based on your symptoms, your history of athletic activity and a physical examination. Your doctor will examine your shin area to confirm that the pain and tenderness are located in your leg muscle (or its tendon) rather than in the shinbone itself. This is because symptoms of shin splints can be confused with the pain of a tibial stress fracture, a small stress-related break in the shinbone. A tibial stress fracture is another type of overuse injury that is common in athletes who run.\nOther important problems that can occur along with shin splints or can mimic the symptoms of shin splints include a stretch or tear of a nearby muscle or tendon or inflammation of the bone surface (periostitis). Compartment syndrome, a rare condition in which pressure in a muscle group rises to a dangerous level, is another problem that may be considered, although the pain of compartment syndrome usually is more severe, is located on the outside of the leg and starts hours after exercise.\nIn most cases, a doctor does not need special diagnostic tests to confirm that you have shin splints. However, additional tests are sometimes necessary to check for a stress fracture. Initially, your doctor may order an x-ray; however, if there is a high suspicion of a stress fracture and the x-ray is normal, an MRI scan may be recommended. In rare cases, for example if your doctor suspects you may have compartment syndrome, you may need a test that measures the pressure within the muscle groups in the lower leg.\n",
      "Expected duration": "If you rest your legs and take a temporary break from running, the pain of shin splints usually subsides within one to two weeks. However, once your pain is gone and you resume training, you should start at a low intensity and then gradually build up. Otherwise, your shin splints may return.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent shin splints, you can:\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have shin splints, your doctor probably will recommend that you follow theRICErules:\nIn addition, you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others), to ease pain and tenderness. To maintain your overall fitness level while you rest your legs, try swimming, water jogging or other athletic activities as recommended by your doctor.\nAs your pain gradually goes away, your doctor may suggest that you start with a walking program before you begin running again. If your shin pain returns when you walk, then you will need to rest your legs again until you are pain-free for two or three days. As part of your rehabilitation, your doctor also may recommend an exercise program to strengthen the muscles in your lower legs and around your ankles.\nIf you have flat feet or a mechanical imbalance in the way you walk, and this increases your risk of shin splints, your doctor may recommend that you use arch supports or heel wedges in your shoes.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have severe pain, tenderness or swelling near your shin, especially if this pain makes it hard for you to walk. Also call if you have milder shin pain that has not improved after two or three weeks.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Call your doctor if you have severe pain, tenderness or swelling near your shin, especially if this pain makes it hard for you to walk. Also call if you have milder shin pain that has not improved after two or three weeks.\n",

      "What is it?": "The shoulder joint is called a ball-and-socket joint. The ball is the rounded top of the bone in the upper arm (humerus), which fits into the socket — the cup-shaped outer part of the shoulder blade. When the top of the humerus moves out of its usual location in the shoulder joint, the shoulder is said to be dislocated. A related injury called a shoulder subluxation occurs when the top of the humerus is only partially displaced and not totally out of its socket.\nIn some cases, a shoulder is dislocated when the arm is pulled or twisted with extreme force in an outward, upward, or backward direction. This extreme force literally pops the top of the humerus out of its socket. In other cases, a shoulder dislocation is the result of a fall on an outstretched arm, a direct forceful blow to the shoulder, a seizure, or a severe electric shock. Seizures and shock can cause shoulder dislocations because they produce extreme, unbalanced muscle contractions that can wrench the humerus out of place.\nDoctors classify shoulder dislocations into three types, depending on the direction of the dislocation:\nAlmost all shoulder dislocations are related to trauma. Occasionally, the dislocation occurs after ordinarily harmless motions, such as raising an arm or rolling over in bed. In these mysterious cases, the real cause may be that the shoulder ligaments are abnormally loose. Loose ligaments are sometimes due to an inherited condition that can increase a person's risk of dislocation in other body joints as well.\nShoulder dislocations are the most common joint dislocation seen by emergency room doctors, accounting for more than 50% of all dislocations treated in hospitals. Young adult men and older women tend to be the groups with the highest rate of shoulder dislocations.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a dislocated shoulder include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The doctor will examine both shoulders, comparing your injured shoulder with your uninjured one. The doctor will check for swelling, shape changes, abrasions, bruising, pain when you move, tenderness, and limited motion at the shoulder joint. The doctor will gently press and feel the area around your shoulder to locate the displaced head of the humerus under the skin. In addition, because many important blood vessels and nerves travel through your shoulder area, your doctor will check the strength of the pulses at your wrist and elbow, and check your muscle strength and your response to touch on your arm, hand, and fingers. In particular, your doctor will look for numbness on the outside of your upper arm, a sign of injury to the axillary nerve, which is vulnerable to injury in a shoulder dislocation.\nIf the results of your physical examination suggest that that you have a dislocated shoulder, your doctor will order shoulder x-rays to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once your displaced humerus is slipped back into its socket, your ability to move your shoulder probably will improve immediately, and the full range of motion should return fully within six to eight weeks if you faithfully follow an exercise program. Although most shoulder strength usually returns within three months, regaining full strength may take up to one year.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you have had a dislocated shoulder, you may be able to prevent a repeat injury by doing shoulder strengthening exercises recommended by your doctor or physical therapist. Once you have dislocated your shoulder, you are more likely to dislocate it again, particularly if you play a contact sport.\n",
      "Treatment": "When the arm bone is forced out of its socket, it remains attached to the muscles of the shoulder blade and upper chest. These muscles pull the arm bone against the shoulder and chest, even when the bone is out of its socket and off-center. If these muscles are in spasm, they need to be relaxed before the doctor can move the arm bone back into its socket.\nYour doctor may give you medications to ease your pain and relax your shoulder muscles. Then the doctor will pull carefully against these muscles until the head of your humerus slips back into its socket. Sometimes, doctors use arm weights on the side of the dislocation to make it easier to extend these tight muscles. This treatment, with or without the weights, is called closed reduction.\nOnce your shoulder joint is back in its normal position, you will rest your arm in a sling for one to four weeks. Teenagers tend to need the sling longer than older people. You also will begin a physical therapy program to restore the normal strength and range of motion in your shoulder joint.\nIf you continue to have severe shoulder pain after closed reduction, or if your injured shoulder is loose and unstable in spite of physical therapy, you may need surgery to repair the fibrous tissues that support your shoulder joint.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you cannot move your shoulder after a fall or other traumatic injury, or if your shoulder is painful, swollen, tender, or unusually shaped.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on many factors, including the severity of your shoulder injury, your age, and your participation in athletic activity. For example, if you are a teenage athlete and you play contact sports such as football or hockey, after a shoulder dislocation your overall risk of a second shoulder dislocation may be as high as 90%. Repeat injury may make your shoulder unstable enough that it needs to be repaired with surgery. Surgery usually restores the shoulder's stability and reduces the risk of future dislocation to 5% or less.\nIf you are an adult and have an uncomplicated shoulder dislocation, your risk of a second dislocation is low, with repeat dislocations occurring only about 25% of the time for people in their 30s and even less often for older age groups.\n",

      "What is it?": "A shoulder sprain is an injury to shoulder ligaments, the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to one another inside or around the shoulder joint. Although most people think of the shoulder as a single joint between the upper arm bone (humerus) and the torso, the shoulder actually has several smaller joints outside the arm bone's socket. Ligaments connect the four bones that are important to the shoulder's function. These bones include:\nA sprain affecting the shoulder most often occurs at the joint between the acromion and collarbone, called the acromioclavicular joint. This injury sometimes is called a shoulder separation. Less often, a shoulder sprain involves the joint between the breastbone and collarbone, called the sternoclavicular joint. This joint is within an inch of the midline of the chest. Many people would not guess that it's part of the shoulder.\n",
      "Acromioclavicular joint sprain": "The acromioclavicular joint is supported by the acromioclavicular ligament and the coracoclavicular ligament at the outside end of the collarbone near the shoulder. They bind the shoulder blade and collarbone tightly together. It takes a lot of force to tear these ligaments. The most common causes of this type of shoulder sprain are either a strong, direct blow to the front or top part of the shoulder or trauma from a fall, especially during athletic training or competition. A shoulder sprain also can be caused when a person collides with an object, such as a goal post or a tree (when skiing). Shoulder sprains are common among athletes who participate in high-velocity or contact sports such as alpine skiing, jet skiing, football, rugby, and wrestling.\nDepending on the severity of the ligament damage, acromioclavicular sprains usually are classified into three grades:\nSome doctors classify the most severe acromioclavicular injuries into even higher grades or types, from IV to VI. With each higher grade, the collarbone is more displaced away from its normal position and the shoulder is more severely deformed.\n",
      "Sternoclavicular joint sprain": "The sternoclavicular joint is located where the inner end of the collarbone meets the breastbone. Because the sternoclavicular joint is even more tightly connected than the acromioclavicular joint, sternoclavicular injuries occur very rarely, only about a quarter as often as acromioclavicular injuries. When the sternoclavicular joint is sprained, it is often when a driver's chest strikes the steering wheel during an auto accident, or when a person is crushed by an object. In athletes, sternoclavicular sprains sometimes are seen among football players and rugby players after a direct kick to the breastbone, or some sideways tackles that impact the back or side of the shoulder.\nSternoclavicular sprains are graded from I to III:\n",
      "Symptoms": "If you have a Grade I acromioclavicular sprain, you will have slight swelling and tenderness at the outside tip of your collarbone. You will have mild pain when you move your arm or shrug your shoulder. In more severe acromioclavicular joint sprains, swelling will distort the normal contour of your joint and the area will be very tender. You will feel significant pain when you try to move your arm, or when your doctor or athletic trainer touches the joint while examining it.\nSymptoms of sternoclavicular sprains are similar to those of acromioclavicular sprains, except swelling and tenderness are located near the midline of the chest.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The doctor will inspect both your shoulders, comparing your injured shoulder with your uninjured one. The doctor will note any swelling, shape differences, abrasions, or bruising and will check for extra motion in the acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints. He or she will test your ability to move your shoulder, and will ask about arm pain. Your doctor will gently press and feel your acromioclavicular joint, sternoclavicular joint, and collarbone.\nBecause many important blood vessels and nerves travel through your shoulder area, the doctor will also check the pulses at your wrist and elbow, and will check the muscle strength and skin feeling in your arm, hand, and fingers.\nIf your physical examination suggests that you have a severe shoulder sprain or fractured bone in the shoulder area, your doctor will order x-rays. In more severe acromioclavicular joint injuries, your doctor may also order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or computed tomography (CT) scans.\n",
      "Expected duration": "A mild sprain may cause pain or limitation in activities for only a week or two. A recovery time of six to eight weeks is common for moderate sprains. Severe sprains may require four months or more.\n",
      "Prevention": "Wearing protective padding during high-impact sports might offer some protection against sprains and other shoulder injuries. If you have had a sprained shoulder, you may help to prevent injuring it again by practicing shoulder strengthening exercises recommended by your doctor or physical therapist.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the type of sprain and its grade.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if a fall or blow to your shoulder makes the area painful, swollen, tender, or deformed.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook depends on the type of sprain and its grade:\n",

      "What is it?": "Sick sinus syndrome is an umbrella term that covers three heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias):\nA problem with a part of the heart called the sinus node causes these arrhythmias. This group of specialized cells in the upper right chamber of the heart controls the heart's rhythm by sending electrical signals that tell the heart to beat. In someone with sick sinus syndrome, these signals do not come at a steady pace.\nSick sinus syndrome is a relatively uncommon problem. How many people have it is hard to say because it often doesn't cause any symptoms and therefore many people may be living with it and not know it. One study estimates that sick sinus syndrome occurs in about one in every 600 people with cardiovascular disease older than 65. It is even less common in younger people. The average age of a person with sick sinus syndrome is about 68. Of the three arrhythmias that fall under the term sick sinus syndrome, sinus bradycardia is the most common.\nWhat causes sick sinus syndrome is not completely understood, but we do know that disorders that cause scarring, degeneration, or damage to the heart can cause sick sinus syndrome. These include:\nCertain medications can make abnormal heart rhythms worse. These include the following drugs, which are all prescribed for various heart problems:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most of the time, sick sinus syndrome doesn't cause any symptoms. When it does cause symptoms, they are very vague and can be attributed to many other disorders. Therefore, it is very hard to diagnose sick sinus syndrome just on the basis of symptoms.\nSymptoms may include:\nOver the long term, sick sinus syndrome can increase your risk for stroke and heart failure. Injuries can occur if you fall during a fainting episode.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor might suspect you have sick sinus syndrome if he or she detects a very slow or irregular heart beat when examining you. (However, even people with sick sinus syndrome may have a normal heart beat during an office visit, especially if they are not having any symptoms at that time.)\nIf an abnormal heart rate is detected, your doctor will review the medications you take to make sure that none of them are contributing to the problem. You will also get an electrocardiogram (EKG, which is a test that can detect arrhythmias). However, an EKG may not tell your doctor for certain what condition is causing your problem, so further testing is often necessary.\nOne of the common tests for sick sinus syndrome is a Holter monitor. Like an EKG, a Holter monitor records the heart's electrical activity via electrodes, but a Holter monitor is attached to a small recording device. That way, you can wear the Holter monitor (also called an event monitor) and go about your day-to-day activities. When you feel an arrhythmia symptom, you write down the date and time. Then your doctor compares the timing of your symptoms to the timing of any abnormalities that the monitor records.\nIf your doctor still can't diagnose the problem, he or she may suggest you get an electrophysiologic study (EPS). This is an invasive procedure, which is why it is used only after other less serious tests are tried.\nFor the study, a cardiologist inserts a thin tube, called a catheter, into an incision in your groin. The doctor then snakes the tube through your body to the heart. The catheter has tiny instruments on its tip, including a camera so the doctor can see where the catheter is going. The pictures show up on a screen in the operating room.\nThe other instruments on the tip of the catheter allow it to sense electrical patterns of your heart and to act as a temporary pacemaker. The pacemaker delivers small electrical shocks to the heart. You can't feel these shocks.\nThe cardiologist will use the pacemaker to vary the speed of your heartbeat. At the same time, a running EKG can show whether your heart's electrical pathways are responding appropriately to the pacemaker. The cardiologist usually speeds up the heart rate, and then turns off the pacemaker for several seconds. Your sinus node should recognize the absence of electrical activity in the heart and turn itself on. If it doesn't, you likely have sick sinus syndrome.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Sick sinus syndrome doesn't go away. You might go for a long time without having any problems, but you still are not cured. In fact, sick sinus syndrome almost always gets worse with time.\n",
      "Prevention": "In many cases, it is not possible to prevent sick sinus syndrome. However, preventing the diseases that lead to sick sinus syndrome (see above) can lead to better cardiovascular health overall and likely prevent sick sinus syndrome. Eating well, exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding tobacco can prevent many heart problems. Medications are also sometimes necessary for heart disease prevention.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you don't have symptoms, treatment may not be necessary. If you are taking a medication that could be the cause, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking that drug.\nPeople who have sinus bradycardia with symptoms usually need to have a permanent pacemaker implanted. This small device gets placed under the skin of your chest during a surgical procedure. Pacemakers use electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.\nPeople with sick sinus syndrome and fast heart rates often cannot tolerate the usual heart-slowing medications. There is a risk that these medications can cause the heart to stop beating. These people also require permanent pacemakers.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience any of the symptoms listed above, see your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for someone with sick sinus syndrome varies greatly, depending on the type of arrhythmia, the age of the person, and any other heart problems that are present. Generally speaking, sick sinus syndrome gets worse with time. That said, people who have pacemakers implanted to control their arrhythmias generally do very well.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Sickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder.\nIt causes:\nHemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. People with sickle cell anemia inherit a defective type of hemoglobin. When oxygen levels inside a red blood cell get low, the defective hemoglobin forms long rods. These rods stretch the red blood cells into long, abnormal \"sickle\" shapes. In contrast, normal red blood cells are disc-shaped.\n\nSickle-shaped red blood cells cannot easily pass through the body's blood vessels. Instead, they clog blood vessels. They block the flow of blood and cut off the oxygen supply to tissues and organs.\nThis lack of oxygen can damage the body's organs and limbs. It causes severe pain in any affected area.\nA normal red cell's lifespan is 120 days. In contrast, sickled blood cells last only 10 to 20 days. As a result, patients with sickle cell disease have chronic anemia--an abnormally low level of red blood cells.\nThe spleen is an organ that helps clear infections. Sickle cell disease damages the spleen. By the time a child with sickle cell anemia is 4 years old, the spleen has usually stopped functioning. As a result, people with sickle cell disease have an increased risk of developing life-threatening infections.\nTo have fully developed sickle cell anemia, you must inherit one gene for the illness from each parent. Sometimes a person inherits only one sickle cell gene from one parent. This person is said to have sickle cell \"trait\" rather than sickle cell anemia. People with sickle cell trait usually have no symptoms. But, they can pass the gene to their children.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of sickle cell anemia include:\nWhen sickled red cells block blood vessels, the oxygen supply to body cells is obstructed. This causes painful episodes called crises. Painful sickle cell crises can affect many different joints and organs. The back, chest, extremities and abdomen are affected most commonly. The level of pain varies, from trivial to excruciating. The episodes typically last from two to seven days.\nIn about half the cases, the pain crisis is accompanied by:\nThese painful episodes can be triggered by many things. Triggers include:\nWomen are more likely to experience a painful episode during their menstrual period.\nBut the majority of sickle cell crises have no identifiable cause.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about:\nHe or she then will perform a physical examination. It will focus on your heart, lungs, joints, eyes and neurological system.\nBlood tests will be done. A complete blood count (CBC) can detect anemia. A microscopic examination of the blood may reveal the characteristic sickled cells. A blood test called hemoglobin electrophoresis confirms the diagnosis, by identifying the abnormal form of hemoglobin that is produced in people with the disease.\nIn families with a history of sickle cell anemia, a doctor may screen for the disorder whenever a new baby is born in your family. Prenatal screening also can be done.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "There is no way to prevent sickle cell anemia.\nIf sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait runs in your family, you and your spouse may wish to speak with a genetic counselor. He or she can explain your chances of passing the condition to your children.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent sickle cell anemia.\nIf sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait runs in your family, you and your spouse may wish to speak with a genetic counselor. He or she can explain your chances of passing the condition to your children.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment of sickle cell anemia may include any of the following:\nFor some children, a hematopoietic stem cell (bone marrow) transplant may cure their illness. The child has to have a sibling who is a suitable donor. However, this is a high-risk treatment. It is primarily used in those with very severe symptoms.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "People with sickle cell disease must see their doctor regularly and receive comprehensive care.\nCall the doctor immediately when anyone with sickle cell disease:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Sickle cell anemia affects different people differently. It follows no set pattern.\nFor example, some patients have only mild symptoms with less than one crisis episode per year. Others have more severe symptoms. Or they may average more than one crisis per month.\nThere is currently no cure for sickle cell anemia. But life expectancy for those with the illness has dramatically increased over the past 30 years.\n",

      "What is Sjögren's syndrome?": "Sjögren's (pronounced \"show grins\") syndrome is a chronic (or lifelong) condition that causes dry mouth and dry eyes. The syndrome also can affect any of the body's glands, including those that secrete sweat, saliva, and oil.\nSjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder, meaning the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells and organs. In this case, the immune system attacks the organs that normally produce lubricating fluid, including the salivary glands in the mouth and the lacrimal glands in the eye. This leads to scarring and, eventually, a marked reduction in tear and saliva production, which causes dryness of the eyes and mouth.\nDry mouth and dry eyes can lead to tooth decay, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, salivary gland stones, infection of the salivary glands, oral fungal infections (thrush), mouth sores, weight loss, malnutrition, bacterial conjunctivitis (a bacterial infection of the conjunctiva), corneal damage and vision loss.\nNamed after Swedish eye doctor Dr. Henrik Sjögren, this syndrome can affect people of all ages and races. However, 90% of all cases involve women, most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 55. The condition affects up to four million people in the United States. The cause of this disease is unknown. Research is ongoing, including recent discoveries that certain genes may make a person more prone to developing Sjögren's syndrome.\nAbout half of people with Sjögren's syndrome also have another connective-tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus). In these people, Sjögren's syndrome is referred to as a secondary condition. In people without another connective-tissue disease, Sjögren's syndrome is called a primary condition.\n",
      "Symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome": "Some people experience only minor symptoms. Others have blurred vision, eye discomfort, recurring mouth infections, swollen salivary glands, and difficulty swallowing or eating. Sjögren's syndrome also can affect the lungs, joints, vagina, pancreas, kidneys, skin, and brain.\nSymptoms include eye pain, irritation, or redness, and dry mouth. The eyes can feel dry and sandy. Many people with this condition also have vaginal dryness, joint pain and stiffness, muscle aches, dry, cracked tongue, and enlarged lymph glands. Other symptoms depend on what other parts of the body are affected. For example, shortness of breath may develop because of lung inflammation and scarring.\n",
      "Diagnosing Sjögren's syndrome": "Sjögren's syndrome may be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are also characteristic of other diseases. Also, disease manifestations vary markedly among different people with this illness.\nIf your doctor suspects you may have Sjögren's, blood tests can determine if you have markers (autoantibodies) of the disease. However, these tests are not reliable enough to confirm the diagnosis by themselves. Certain tests can determine the amount of lubrication your body's glands are producing. A Schirmer test uses a small piece of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid. A slit-lamp examination involves placing a drop of dye into the eye and examining the eye with a special instrument. A salivary-function test measures the amount of dryness in the mouth. Your dentist or oral surgeon also may recommend a lip biopsy to examine a sample of the minor salivary glands. In a biopsy, a small piece of tissue is removed and examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration of Sjögren's syndrome": "Sjögren's syndrome is generally a lifelong disease.\n",
      "Preventing Sjögren's syndrome": "There is no known way to prevent Sjögren's syndrome, although you can prevent symptoms from getting worse by avoiding certain medications, dry environments, caffeine, and alcohol. Complications, such as cavities, may be prevented as well.\n",
      "Treating Sjögren's syndrome": "Sjögren's syndrome cannot be cured, but proper treatment can help to relieve symptoms and allow you to live more comfortably. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can reduce joint swelling and stiffness, and muscle aches. Your physician may prescribe corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs for more serious complications. Discuss with your doctor whether any other medications you are taking, such as antihistamines or antidepressants, may be contributing to dryness.\nAsk your physician or ophthalmologist for a good-quality artificial-tear preparation or lubricating ointment. Moisture-chamber eyeglasses, which preserve existing tears and protect the eyes from drafts and wind, also can be useful. When eye dryness is severe, a procedure called punctal occlusion (with punctal plugs) may be performed. This procedure plugs the tiny drain holes in the inner corner of the eye. This slows down tear drainage, encouraging tears to accumulate and moisten the eye. Immune suppressing eye drops, including cyclosporine and lifitegrast, may be useful and are among the newer medications approved for this condition.  Another newer treatment for dry eyes is a special contact lens (called a scleral lens) that is larger than standard contact lenses.\nLubricants also are available for nasal and vaginal dryness. A good moisturizer can alleviate the tightness of dry skin. Humidifiers increase the moisture in the home or office. Avoid drafts from air conditioners, heaters and radiators when possible.\nTo ease dry mouth, drink plenty of liquids throughout the day. Sugarless gum and candy can stimulate saliva production. Artificial-saliva preparations also are available. Avoid caffeinated beverages and alcohol because they can increase dryness. Also avoid acidic or spicy foods, which can irritate your mouth. In severe cases, your dentist or physician may prescribe medications such as pilocarpine (Salagen) or cevimeline (Evoxac). These tend to work better to relieve dry mouth than dry eyes. When Sjögren's syndrome is accompanied by joint inflammation, medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (such as hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate) may be helpful. Limited studies suggest that injections of rituximab may reduce symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome that do not respond to other approaches.\nBrush your teeth immediately after eating with toothpaste that contains fluoride, and see your dentist frequently. You have a higher risk of tooth decay because you have less saliva, which has antibacterial properties that help protect your teeth, and also washes the surfaces of your teeth. Don't smoke or use other forms of tobacco. They can harm your mouth, nasal tissue, eyes and lungs. Fluoride and anti-bacterial rinses (such as chlorhexidine-fluoride) may be helpful to prevent dental and periodontal disease.\nWalking or swimming can help keep your joints and muscles flexible. If Sjögren's syndrome is a secondary symptom of a connective-tissue disease, medications and the type and intensity of your exercise program should be tailored to that specific disease.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have dry eyes and mouth for more than a few days, call your doctor or dentist. Keep in mind that Sjögren's syndrome is difficult to diagnose, and your symptoms may be due to another condition.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis is highly variable. Some people may experience only mild symptoms and be able to control them with medications. Others can cycle through periods of relative healthiness followed by severe disease. Although there is an increased risk of lymphoma (a cancer of the lymph nodes) in this disease, most people with Sjögren's syndrome have a normal life span and good quality of life.\n",

      "What is it?": "A skin tag is a soft, skin-colored growth that hangs from the surface of the skin on a thin piece of tissue called a stalk. Its medical name is acrochordon. Skin tags are not skin cancers and cannot turn into skin cancers.\n\nSkin tags typically appear as people age. They are quite common in people 60 and older. A tendency to develop skin tags may run in families. Skin tags often develop after weight gain or pregnancy.\nSkin tags appear most often in skin folds of the neck, armpits, torso, beneath the breasts or in the genital region. They can become irritated if they are in an area where clothing or jewelry rubs against them, and they may be unsightly.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A skin tag at first may appear as a tiny soft bump on the skin. Over time, it grows into a flesh-colored piece of skin attached to the skin surface by a stalk. It's easy to move or wiggle a skin tag back and forth. A skin tag is painless, although it can become irritated if it is rubbed a lot.\nIf a skin tag is twisted on its stalk, a blood clot can develop within it and the skin tag may become painful.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Doctors can recognize a skin tag easily by looking at it. For a skin tag with a characteristic appearance (soft, easily moveable, flesh-colored or slightly darker and usually attached to the skin surface by a stalk), you won't need any tests. If you notice that a skin growth is too firm to be wiggled easily, is a different color than surrounding skin, is multicolored or has raw or bleeding areas, ask your doctor to examine it. If it is not obvious that your skin growth is a skin tag, your doctor may want to do a biopsy, which means he or she will remove a small piece of skin to be examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Skin tags are permanent growths unless you have them removed. Many people develop multiple skin tags.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent skin tags.\n",
      "Treatment": "Doctors remove skin tags with sharp scissors, a sharp blade or, less commonly, by freezing or burning them off at the stalk. Bleeding can be stopped with a chemical (aluminum chloride) or electric (cauterizing) treatment.\nBecause skin tags are only a cosmetic concern, not a medical problem, most health insurance plans will not pay for their removal.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you notice that a suspected skin tag changes color or becomes painful.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for people with skin tags is excellent. They are not cancerous or precancerous growths, and they can be removed easily.\n",

      "What is it?": "Sleep apnea is a disorder that causes people to stop breathing for short periods during sleep. These periods are called apneas. Apneas usually last between 10 and 30 seconds. In severe cases, apneas can happen many hundreds of times each night. People with untreated sleep apnea are more likely to develop high blood pressure.\nApneas disrupt a person's ability to get a good night's sleep, making them less alert during the day. This can lead to accidents. People with untreated sleep apnea are up to seven times more likely to be involved in motor vehicle accidents.\nThere are two types of sleep apnea:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include excessive sleepiness during waking hours. Loud snoring is another symptom, and the person's bed partner may be the first to notice this problem. Morning headache and dry mouth can occur. Obesity is common, though not all people with sleep apnea are overweight.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If your doctor suspects sleep apnea, he or she is likely to do the following during your visit:\nA sleep study is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Sleep studies traditionally have been performed overnight, at a sleep center. However, today home sleep studies are often sufficient to make the diagnosis.\nDuring a formal study done at a sleep center, sensors are placed on your finger, scalp, and chest. The sensors on your scalp detect brain waves to measure how long it takes you to fall asleep, how long it takes you to enter different stages of sleep, and how often you wake up during the night. The monitor on your finger measures the oxygen level in your blood. Monitors on your chest record your heart rate and breathing, as well as how often you stop breathing. A monitor is also placed just inside your nostrils to measure air flow.\n\nIllustration: Alayna Paquette\nHome sleep studies are not as complete as studies done in sleep centers. The home equipment can measure blood oxygen levels, chest movement, and nasal airflow. Some also track head movement and heart rate and record snoring levels.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long sleep apnea lasts depends on its cause and on the effectiveness of treatment. Generally, sleep apnea is a chronic disorder. This means you'll be dealing with it for a lifetime. For people with central sleep apnea, how long the problem lasts depends on treatment for the underlying neurological or cardiovascular disorders.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent obstructive sleep apnea by maintaining a healthy weight.\nTo reduce sleep apnea symptoms, avoid alcohol and sedatives.\n",
      "Treatment": "To treat obstructive sleep apnea, many people sleep with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. A CPAP device is a mask that fits over your mouth and nose. It forces your airways open with a stream of air. This allows you to breathe more easily.\nWhen we fall asleep, all of our muscles relax, including the muscles that hold our jaw forward. Some people with obstructive sleep apnea partially close their airway when the jaw moves backward during sleep. These people may benefit from a fitted mouthpiece to wear at night that keeps the jaw forward.\nMany people with sleep apnea are overweight. The extra fat in and around your airway can make it smaller and easier to compress. Losing weight might make a big difference.\nSome people with obstructive sleep apnea only have problems when they lie on their back. In that case, you can try sleeping against a wedge pillow, or wear a stuffed fanny pack around your waist to keep you from rolling onto your back.\nSurgery may be considered for some people if other therapies have not been successful. The most common procedure involves removing excess tissue in the back of the throat and shortening the soft tissue that hangs down (the uvula).\nAnother treatment for people with moderate to severe sleep apnea is an implanted pacemaker-like device called a hypoglossal nerve stimulator. This treatment features a device similar to a pacemaker that's surgically implanted in the upper chest. The FDA-approved system, called Inspire, monitors your breathing and, if needed, stimulates nerves around your tongue and airway to prevent them from collapsing.\nFor central sleep apnea, treating any underlying neurological or cardiovascular disorders may eliminate the problem. CPAP may also be useful.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people with obstructive sleep apnea can sleep and feel better if they follow the treatment plan recommended by their doctor.\n",

      "What is smallpox?": "Smallpox is a contagious and sometimes fatal disease caused by two related viruses: variola major and variola minor. Variola major is the more common and severe form, with an overall historical fatality rate of about 30%. Variola minor is less common and causes a milder form of smallpox that is usually not fatal. Historic death rates were less than 1%.\nSmallpox eradication was one of the greatest successes of modern public health. Through a sophisticated global vaccination campaign, the World Health Organization officially declared in 1980 that smallpox had been eliminated worldwide. The last known case of smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949, and the last case of naturally occurring smallpox was reported in 1977 in Somalia.\nToday, the smallpox virus is known to exist only in secured laboratory stockpiles in the United States and Russia. However, it is theorized that other countries may have possession of the virus as well.\nFor this reason, there is some concern that terrorists may have access to the virus, which could be used as a bioterrorism agent. Because smallpox has been eradicated, any human smallpox infection would be evidence of bioterrorism. For these reasons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed a response plan for possible smallpox outbreaks, with detailed instructions on how to mobilize appropriate personnel and vaccines.\nSmallpox is usually spread through direct and fairly prolonged contact with an infected person, particularly with face-to-face contact. It is typically spread among people who share living quarters. This is probably because patients with smallpox are severely ill in the period when they are most infectious, and so they are unlikely to have contact with many people outside their homes. Smallpox also can be acquired from infected bedding and clothes. Rarely, smallpox is spread through the air of enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains.\n",
      "Symptoms of smallpox": "A case of smallpox passes through six stages.\n",
      "Diagnosing smallpox": "The diagnosis of smallpox is based on a physical examination and blood tests. Fever and the distinctive, progressive skin rash will indicate smallpox. Your doctor will evaluate your recent health history and symptoms to determine if you have been exposed to and if you have smallpox.\n",
      "Expected duration of smallpox": "A case of smallpox usually lasts about five weeks. This includes an average of 12 days of theincubation period,four days of theinitial symptoms,four days of anearly rash,five days ofpustular rash,five days ofscabs,and six days for thescabs to fall off.\n",
      "Preventing smallpox": "The only way to prevent smallpox is by receiving the smallpox vaccine, which was developed from the vaccinia virus, which is related to the smallpox virus but causes a far milder form of disease. In 1972, routine smallpox vaccination was stopped in the United States because the risks of the vaccine itself were felt to be higher than the risk of getting smallpox. The smallpox vaccine caused one to two deaths for every million people vaccinated.\nToday, because of the possible threat of bioterrorism, the vaccine is being considered for members of the armed services, public health workers, first responders, and health care professionals. In addition, the United States government has enough vaccine to respond to a smallpox outbreak in the country. Vaccination within three to seven days after exposure to smallpox may prevent the disease in rare cases, but usually limits its symptoms and is thought to reduce mortality.\n",
      "Treating smallpox": "There is no specific treatment for smallpox other than supportive care. Antiviral drugs are being developed and tested for use against smallpox.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If a single case of smallpox is detected anywhere in the world, there will be a huge media and public health response, which will include very specific instructions about what you and your family should do, where or if to seek treatment, and whether and where you should be vaccinated. If no smallpox has been detected, it is exceedingly unlikely that you would have been exposed and infected with the smallpox virus. It is far more likely that you have a different, more common viral infection. You should call your doctor if you are experiencing any of the symptoms of smallpox infection, such as high fever and rash that first appears as red spots and that are most plentiful on the face, hands, arms, legs and feet.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Historically, the variola major virus, the most common smallpox virus, was associated with death rates of about 30%. It is important to acknowledge that the mortality rates from smallpox infection are historical, and it is not known what effect modern medicine would have on people's ability to survive smallpox. Survivors of smallpox infection usually were left with disfiguring scars on the body, and many developed eye infections that led to blindness.\n",

      "What Is It?": "A person with somatic symptom disorder has one or more \"somatic\" (physical) symptoms over a long period of time (usually half a year or more). Symptoms may or may not be explained fully by another medical diagnosis.\nThe person may be reacting to normal bodily sensations or a minor illness. He or she may have a strong tendency to worry about illness or feel more threatened than average by health concerns. But the person is not \"faking.\" The symptoms cause authentic distress.\nThe person may:\nSeek care from more than one physician at the same time.\nNot feel reassured by the evaluation or treatment received.\nBe unresponsive to medical treatment.\nBe particularly sensitive to adverse effects of treatment.\nPeople with somatic symptom disorder do get other serious medical illnesses. Therefore, doctors must be careful not to dismiss symptoms too easily.\nA person with somatic symptom disorder also may have symptoms of anxiety and depression. He or she may begin to feel hopeless and attempt suicide, or may have trouble adapting to the stresses of life. The person may abuse alcohol or drugs, including prescription medications.\nSpouses and other family members may become distressed because the person's symptoms continue for long periods of time and no medical treatment seems to help.\nSymptoms of somatic symptom disorder vary by culture, sometimes depending on how illness or \"sick roles\" are viewed in a given culture. Cultural factors also affect the proportions of men and women with the disorder.\nScientists do not know the cause of the symptoms reported by people with somatic symptom disorder, but researchers have some theories. It is possible, for example, that people with this disorder perceive bodily sensations in an unusual way. Or they may describe feelings in physical (rather than mental or emotional) terms. Trauma or stress may cause a person's physical sensations to change.\nIn 2013, this diagnosis replaced other disorders that are no longer listed in the diagnostic manual for psychiatry. In other words, somatic symptom disorder replaces the following diagnoses:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms usually occur over many years. The person may be distressed and function poorly at work and at home. Medical evaluation does not explain the symptoms, or the symptoms may exceed what would be expected in any medical illness that is found. Pain is the most common symptom. Symptoms can appear in almost any part of the body.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "There are no laboratory tests to determine whether a person has somatic symptom disorder. The doctor may suspect it when a person has persistent physical complaints that do not respond to usual medical evaluation and treatment. The doctor may do tests to check for diseases that can look like somatic symptom disorder, such as multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), or syndromes such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome.\nMany people with somatic symptom disorder also have a problem with depression or anxiety, so doctors may consider these diagnoses. If the person is willing, it is helpful to consult with a mental health professional for further evaluation.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Somatic symptom disorder is a chronic (long-lasting) problem. The disorder usually starts before the age of 25 or 30, although it can begin in adolescence. It can last for many years.\n",
      "Prevention": "Although there is no way to prevent this disorder, a correct diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder can help the person avoid excessive medical testing. This is a challenge both for the person with the disorder and the doctor, because new symptoms could be caused by a medical problem other than somatic symptom disorder.\n",
      "Treatment": "People with somatic symptom disorder may find it difficult to accept a referral to a mental health professional or to accept that medical evaluation and treatment cannot relieve the symptoms. They are particularly sensitive to the stigma associated with mental disorders. In addition, they sometimes are dismissed by a subset of physicians who do not see their symptoms as a legitimate cause for concern.\nIdeally, if a primary care physician and mental health professional work together, the person's physical symptoms can be evaluated while he or she also gets help managing the frustration of not having a clear diagnosis or treatment plan.\nBut mental health treatment can sometimes reduce symptoms or improve quality of life.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may help reduce symptoms or address any accompanying anxiety or depression. Sometimes, an antidepressant medication or other psychiatric medication can provide relief from the physical symptoms that stem from somatic symptom disorder (especially if the person also has an anxiety or mood disorder). Treatment is often aimed at managing conflict at home or coping with secondary problems, such as problems with work and social functioning.\nPsychotherapy can help the person deal with or manage chronic physical discomfort. Stress management (for example, relaxation techniques) may be useful. Some cognitive behavior therapists teach patients to identify the thoughts and feelings that are associated with changes in physical symptoms. They may help an individual reduce the tendency toward \"body scanning,\" or the constant monitoring of body sensations.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "The earlier a person with somatic symptom disorder can be evaluated by a mental health professional, the easier it will be to help the person deal with the consequences of the disorder, such as exposure to unnecessary tests and treatment, or difficulty with relationships and poor productivity at work. However, a person with this disorder may avoid treatment by a mental health professional.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Medications may provide some relief. Psychotherapy tends to proceed slowly, because the person probably has been living with the disorder for many years before starting treatment. It is difficult to give up long-standing patterns of behavior, but with persistence and support, progress is possible.\n",

      "What is it?": "A sore throat, also called a throat infection or pharyngitis, is a painful inflammation of the back part of the throat (pharynx). Pharyngitis can involve some or all of these parts of the throat:\nThe most common cause of sore throat is infection with bacteria or a virus.\nBecause an infection of the pharynx almost always involves the tonsils, tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils) was once a common name for infectious pharyngitis.\nAbout 90 percent of throat infections are caused by a virus. Although people who have the flu (influenza), cold sores (oral herpes simplex) or infectious mononucleosis (andquot;mono\") also commonly have a sore throat, these viral infections usually cause other telltale symptoms in addition to throat pain.\nIn regions that have warm summers and cool winters, viral pharyngitis typically peaks during the winter and early spring. This is a time when people are more likely to gather in poorly ventilated rooms. The viruses that cause pharyngitis spread easily.\nThe viruses can spread through the air by hanging on to droplets from coughs and sneezes. They stick to unwashed hands that have been exposed to fluids from a sick person's nose or mouth.\nIn most people who are otherwise healthy, simple viral pharyngitis doesn't last long, goes away on its own and does not causes any long-term complications, although the short-term discomfort can be significant.\nIn cases of infectious pharyngitis that are not viral, the cause is almost always a bacterium — usually a group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, which causes what is commonly called strep throat. Like viral pharyngitis, strep throat can spread quickly and easily within a community, especially during late winter and early spring.\nUnlike most forms of viral pharyngitis, however, untreated strep throat can lead to serious complications, such as glomerulonephritis (a kidney disorder) and rheumatic fever (a potentially serious illness that can damage heart valves). A strep infection also has the potential to spread within the body, causing pockets of pus (abscesses) in the tonsils and in the soft tissue around the throat.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptom of pharyngitis is a sore throat and pain with swallowing. In infectious pharyngitis, other symptoms vary depending on whether the infection is viral or bacterial (usually strep throat):\nChildren may have diarrhea.\nSome viruses cause painful sores in and around the mouth, including the lips.\nChildren also can have nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.\nBecause symptoms of viral and bacterial pharyngitis can overlap, it may be difficult for the doctor to distinguish between them based on symptoms alone. As a general rule, if you have a prominent cough and nasal symptoms you are more likely to have viral pharyngitis than strep throat.\nIn addition to viral and bacterial pharyngitis, an infection with fungi (Candidaor \"yeast\") sometimes can cause throat pain, difficulty swallowing and white patches inside the mouth. This throat infection, commonly called thrush, usually affects infants and people with weakened immune systems.\nA sore throat that lasts for more than a couple of weeks may be caused by acid reflux from the stomach, breathing through the mouth in a dry environment, postnasal drip or, rarely, a tumor.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "After reviewing your symptoms, the doctor will ask if you might recently have been exposed to someone with strep throat or any other infection involving the throat, nose or ears.\nAfter recording your temperature, your doctor will examine you, paying particular attention to your mouth, throat, nose, ears and the lymph nodes in your neck. If your doctor is quite sure that you have strep throat, he or she may prescribe antibiotics without further testing. If there is some uncertainty, the doctor may want to do a strep test.\nA rapid strep test is done in your doctor's office, takes only a few minutes to do and detects 80% to 90% of all cases of strep throat. If this quick test is negative, but your doctor still believes you might have strep, your doctor will take a sample of your throat fluids for more intensive testing in a laboratory. Results will be available in 24 to 48 hours.\n",
      "Expected duration": "If you have simple viral pharyngitis, your symptoms should go away gradually over a period of about one week. If you have strep throat, your symptoms should subside within two to three days after you begin taking antibiotics.\n",
      "Prevention": "While it's impossible to prevent all infections, you can help to decrease exposure and spreading:\n",
      "Treatment": "Because antibiotics do not work against viruses, viral pharyngitis usually is treated by treating the symptoms to make you feel more comfortable until your body's immune system defeats the infection. These measures include:\nThese measures will help to ease your discomfort with any type of throat infection. If you have strep throat, you also will take antibiotics to prevent complications. Your doctor will prescribe a 10-day course of penicillin or amoxicillin to eliminate the strep bacteria. If you are allergic to penicillin, including amoxicillin, you may be given erythromycin (sold under several brand names) or one of the other macrolides, such as azithromycin (Zithromax). It's important to take all the medication, even after you start to feel better.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor promptly if you have a sore throat along with any of the following symptoms:\nAlso, call your doctor if you have any type of throat discomfort that lasts for more than two weeks.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Overall, the prognosis is excellent. Almost all people with viral and strep pharyngitis recover completely without complications.\n",

      "What is it?": "Superficial leg veins, sometimes called \"spider veins\" occur when tiny veins congregate below the surface of the skin, causing red, blue or purple discolorations. Spider veins get their name from the shape of the discolorations. Some cases of spider veins can be quite small. Others are more noticeable. They may make you feel self-conscious, but they are harmless, and any treatment is usually done for cosmetic reasons only.\n\nSpider veins are most common on the thighs, ankles and calves, and are more common in women than men. Their cause isn't completely understood in every case, but they can run in families. Some cases are related to pregnancy, use of birth control pills or weight gain.\nOther types of problematic veins that can appear similar to spider veins include:\nSometimes, the terms spider veins and telangiectasias are used interchangeably.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Red or bluish-purple blood vessels appear, usually on the legs or thighs, but sometimes on the face, forearms or hands. Spider veins usually do not cause any symptoms, but rarely may cause a mild dull discomfort or burning sensation.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your health care professional can diagnose spider veins by looking at them.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Spider veins may be permanent or may disappear on their own after a period of months, especially if they are caused by pregnancy or certain medications.\n",
      "Prevention": "Because the causes of spider veins aren't completely understood, they can't always be prevented. It's helpful to maintain a healthy weight and stay physically fit.\nIf you have spider veins, you might help to avoid developing more of them by not standing still or crossing your legs for prolonged periods of time and by wearing support stockings.\n",
      "Treatment": "Spider veins do not require treatment. In some people, compression stockings may decrease the size of existing spider veins and help to prevent new ones. The two most common cosmetic treatments for spider veins are sclerotherapy and laser treatment:\n\nLaser treatmentdirects pulses from a laser light to the spider veins, causing tiny blood clots to form. The blood vessels become blocked off and eventually are reabsorbed by the body.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Spider veins are not harmful to your overall health. If you are self-conscious about your spider veins, or if they become painful or tender, see your doctor about the possibility of treatment.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If you decide on cosmetic treatment for your spider veins, you can expect a 50% to 90% improvement. You may need several treatment sessions to achieve the desired result. After treatment, a slight discoloration of the skin may remain for weeks or even as long as a year before fading. In many cases, spider veins disappear entirely, but they can return.\n",

      "What is spina bifida?": "Spina bifida is one of a group of disorders called neural tube defects — malformations of the brain, spinal cord, or their coverings. Spina bifida occurs when a fetus's developing spinal column does not close properly in the first 28 days following fertilization. The disorder can take one of three forms:\nMeningoceles and myelomeningoceles may appear as saclike structures on an infant's back at birth. When most people refer to spina bifida, they are referring to the most severe form, myelomeningocele. The incidence of neural tube defects varies by country, ranging between one and 10 per 10,000 births. Higher rates are often reported among poorer populations.\n",
      "Symptoms of spina bifida": "The symptoms of spinal bifida can range from mild to severe depending on the severity of the condition itself. In myelomeningocele, the child may have muscle weakness or paralysis below the level of the incompletely closed spinal column, because nerves traveling to the rest of the body from the spinal cord do not function properly. Loss of sensation and an inability to control bladder or bowel function are common.\nAdditionally, cerebrospinal fluid may build up in the brain, leading to a condition called hydrocephalus, which is common in children with myelomeningocele. If left untreated, hydrocephalus can cause brain damage, blindness, or seizures.\nIn addition to physical problems, spina bifida can produce learning problems, including difficulty with the following:\nAdditional birth defects often accompany spina bifida, including abnormal brain development (called Chiari II malformation), cleft lip or palate, heart malformations, and abnormal genitourinary tract development. Other conditions that may occur more often in those with spina bifida than in those without neural tube defects include latex allergy (perhaps related to the multiple surgeries required early in life), obesity, skin problems, depression, and gastrointestinal disorders. Spina bifida is also associated with scoliosis, perhaps as a complication of muscle paralysis or abnormalities within the spinal cord.\n",
      "Diagnosing spina bifida": "Spina bifida most often is diagnosed at birth when a sac on the baby's spine is seen. Spina bifida may be suspected during pregnancy because a screening test, the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), is higher than normal. Because a number of factors can influence the results of an AFP test, a high level does not establish the diagnosis by itself. If the AFP level is elevated, the test is usually repeated, and if the level is still abnormal, further tests such as ultrasound and amniocentesis may be recommended.\n",
      "Expected duration of spina bifida": "Spina bifida is a lifelong condition. A baby born with spina bifida (and myelomeningocele) usually has surgery within the first few days of life to attempt to preserve as much spinal cord function as possible. Other surgeries and extensive medical care probably will be required throughout the person's lifetime.\n",
      "Preventing spina bifida": "Studies have shown that getting enough folic acid dramatically reduces a woman's chance of giving birth to a baby with spina bifida. Folic acid supplementation should begin before pregnancy takes place, because the spinal column forms so early after fertilization. In addition to its ability to prevent spina bifida, folic acid appears to reduce its severity as well.\nAs a result of these studies, in 1992 the U.S. Public Health Service began recommending that all women of childbearing age consume 0.4 milligrams of folic acid daily. Consuming this amount probably requires taking a vitamin supplement, although folic acid is found in dark green leafy vegetables, egg yolks, and some fruits and their juices. Since the recommendation was issued, many other foods, including breads and cereals, are now fortified with folic acid.\nPrenatal counseling may include testing for neural tube defects, complications of the condition, and consideration of terminating the pregnancy. Fetal surgery is available in only a few medical centers, so deciding where to deliver is important when a significant neural tube defect is suspected.\nCertain complications of spina bifida may be prevented with proper medical care. For example, the detection and treatment of bladder problems and urinary tract infections can prevent the development of kidney disease.\n",
      "Treating spina bifida": "While spina bifida occulta usually requires no treatment, the more severe types of spina bifida usually require surgery soon after delivery to close the opening in the back, to preserve spinal cord function, and to reduce the risk of infection. Fetal surgery may be an option and is most often performed during the second trimester.\nAdditional surgeries are often required. Shunting, a procedure that drains excess fluid from the brain into the abdomen, controls hydrocephalus and can prevent or reduce many of the consequences of this condition.\nChildren with spina bifida will need to learn how to use wheelchairs, crutches, or braces to improve their mobility. Other interventions can help them become more independent in managing bladder and bowel problems. Educational issues can be addressed with the appropriate professionals.\nOther treatments depend on the severity of the abnormality and which complications develop. For example, constipation can be treated with laxatives, and physical therapy can improve strength and function.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Doctors will be involved from birth onward in the care of a child with spina bifida. If you notice an abnormal appearance in your child's back or have concerns about whether his or her neurological function is normal, let your child's pediatrician know.\n",
      "Prognosis": "As a result of today's sophisticated medical techniques and interventions, a child with spina bifida often lives well into adulthood, though usually with significant imapirment of spinal cord function.\n",

      "What Is It?": "The spinal cord carries nerve signals from the brain to the rest of the body. Trauma to the spinal cord can result from a number of injuries: about half occur after motor vehicle accidents; followed by falls; gunshot wounds or other violence; and sports-related injuries. The average age at injury is 42 years, and approximately 80% of those affected are male. Up to one-quarter of cases occur after significant alcohol ingestion. Pre-existing disease in the spine can make spinal cord trauma more likely. For example, complications of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis may lead to spinal cord damage.\nMost spinal cord injuries occur in the area of the neck called the cervical region. Trauma can result from bruising to the spinal cord itself, loss of blood flow to the cord or cuts in the cord. Spinal cord injuries are serious and can cause diminished strength, coordination and sensation as well as other functions, such as bladder control.\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of spinal cord trauma vary and depend on the location and severity of the injury. Complete spinal cord trauma -- an injury that results in a total loss of sensation or the ability to move -- occurs at about the same level as the injury. For example, a person injured in the middle of the neck will lack feeling and be unable to move below the middle of the neck. Almost one-half of all spinal cord injuries are complete. Complete injuries that take place in the upper neck can compromise breathing ability and require the person to use a mechanical ventilator. Injuries to the spinal cord in the neck or upper back may cause abnormalities in blood pressure, sweating and in regulating body temperature. In addition, loss of bladder and bowel control and increased muscle tone in the extremities (spasticity) may accompany spinal cord injury. Some of these symptoms may not be apparent immediately after the injury.\nInjuries to a specific side of the spinal cord or its center will produce characteristic patterns of symptoms, such as weakness or paralysis of arms or legs, or one side of the body. In an injured person who is unconscious, the degree of neurological injury may be hard to assess, so doctors must have a high degree of suspicion that a spinal cord injury has taken place and take steps to protect the spinal cord. This usually is done by using a cervical collar to immobilize the neck or by strapping the person to a stiff backboard for transport.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The possibility of spinal cord trauma should be considered in anyone who has been in a severe automobile accident or who has experienced significant injury to the head or neck.\nIf you are conscious, you will be asked about neck pain and whether you can feel and move your arms and legs. Significant pain, bruising and swelling of the skin and tissues over the neck or back may raise the suspicion of a spinal cord injury. A physical examination may reveal loss of sensation, weakness, and abnormal reflexes.\nYou also will be assessed for whether you have other injuries that may be diverting attention from a neck injury, and for the presence of other signs of spinal cord injury. X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also may be used to evaluate your spine and the spinal cord.\nA cervical collar to keep your neck immobilized often will be left in place until the results of tests are available. If a spinal cord injury is suspected, the collar may be left in place for at least several days, even if tests are negative, in case an injury does exist but hasn't been detected because of swelling or muscle spasm.\nComplete spinal cord injuries are diagnosed when total loss of sensation and control occurs. Incomplete injuries cause variable amounts of sensory loss, weakness or paralysis, depending on the site of the injury.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "How long the symptoms of spinal cord injury last depends on the nature and extent of the injury. Minor bruising may go away over time, although full recovery sometimes takes weeks or months. More serious injuries often will result in permanent loss of function. Strategies for helping nerve cells (neurons) recover after injury is an area of active research.\n",
      "Prevention": "Preventing spinal cord injury requires preventing traumatic injury to the spinal column, especially the neck. The leading causes of spinal cord injury include automobile accidents, falls, sports, diving accidents and firearms. To prevent spinal cord injury:\n",
      "Treatment": "Emergency care, surgery (when necessary), rehabilitation and supportive care, including use of respirators, can help people with spinal cord injuries survive and make the most of their remaining neurologic function.\nIn the past, corticosteroids were often given just after the injury to reduce swelling around the injured spinal cord. While corticosteroid therapy remains an option, a number of guidelines have removed this treatment as a standard recommendation due to a lack of convincing evidence supporting its effectiveness and its potential to cause side effects.\nMost treatment of spinal cord injuries involves a \"wait and see\" approach. If the injury is minor, only time will reveal the extent of recovery. For those with major injuries, a complete recovery is highly unlikely, and treatment consists of providing supportive care, teaching new skills and developing coping strategies.\nSurgery sometimes is required to stabilize a damaged spine, to remove fragments of injured bone, discs, or foreign objects (such as bullets), to drain fluid or a blood clot that is pressing on the spinal cord.\nActive areas of research include:\nSome believe that stem cells hold promise in helping people with spinal cord trauma regenerate damaged nerve cells so that neurologic function can be regained.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "All cases of actual or possible spinal cord trauma should be evaluated by a doctor immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Spinal cord trauma may heal over time without further problems, or it may result in permanent deficits, depending on the location and severity of the injury. Early recovery of at least some movement or sensation suggests that additional recovery is possible. Lost sensation or function lasting more than 6 months is unlikely to improve.\n",

      "What is it?": "The spinal cord, which lies protected inside the spine (backbones), contains bundles of nerves that transmit messages between the brain and the nerves throughout the body. A tumor on or near the spinal cord can disrupt this communication, impair function and seriously threaten health.\nSpinal cord tumors are masses of abnormal cells that grow in the spinal cord, between its protective sheaths, or on the surface of the sheath that covers the spinal cord. Primary spinal cord tumors develop within the spinal cord rather than spreading from other parts of the body. These primary tumors usually are noncancerous (benign) and even the cancerous ones rarely spread to other parts of the body.\nPrimary spinal cord tumors can affect people of all ages, but are seen most commonly in young and middle-aged adults.\nMost cancerous spinal cord tumors are secondary, meaning they spread from a cancer at another site of the body. Up to 20% of people whose cancer has spread throughout the body has had it spread to the brain or spinal cord. These secondary cancerous tumors most frequently start as lung, prostate or breast cancer.\nDoctors divide spinal cord tumors into three major groups based on their location:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Spinal cord tumors generally develop slowly and worsen over time. They can cause many symptoms depending upon their location. Symptoms arise as the tumor presses on the spinal cord or the nerves that exit it. Tumors also may restrict the flow of blood to the spinal cord. Common symptoms include:\nThe part of the body affected by the symptoms will vary depending on the tumor's location on the spinal cord. In general, symptoms occur in parts of the body that are at the same level as or lower than the tumor.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If you have any of the symptoms of a spinal cord tumor, your doctor will examine you and review your medical history for other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. The physical exam will include a standard neurological examination, which checks eye movement, eye reflexes and pupil reaction; reflexes; hearing; sensation; strength; and balance and coordination.\nIf your doctor suspects that you may have a spinal tumor, he or she may recommend x-rays of the spine and other diagnostic tests, including:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once it develops, a spinal cord tumor usually will continue to grow until it is treated. Without treatment, it can lead to permanent paralysis, significant disability and death.\n",
      "Prevention": "Although spinal cord tumors cannot be prevented, some forms of cancer that spread to the spinal cord can be prevented or cured before they can spread to the spine. Examples including lung cancer, which may be prevented by not smoking, and breast cancer, which may be cured if detected early through appropriate screening. While some benign tumors can occur more often in certain families, the cause of primary spinal cord tumors remains a mystery. Possible causes under investigation include defective genes, viruses and exposure to chemicals.\n",
      "Treatment": "Surgery usually is recommended for noncancerous and cancerous primary spinal cord tumors, and usually is successful for tumors located outside the spinal cord. However, other tumors may be impossible to remove without significantly damaging the spinal cord. In those cases, radiation therapy may be used to slow the tumor's growth. Surgical removal of surrounding vertebrae can also help to relieve pain and other symptoms by reducing pressure on the spinal nerves. Chemotherapy may be recommended for certain types of tumors, usually after surgical treatment.\nFor secondary tumors, the treatment will depend upon the type of cancer that has spread to the spinal cord. However, radiation is regarded as a primary treatment for secondary cancer that is compressing the spinal cord. With radiation therapy, care must be taken to limit possible damage to surrounding normal spinal tissue, because such damage can continue to worsen and can be irreversible. The spinal cord is even more sensitive to the effects of radiation than brain tissue. In particular, the thoracic spinal cord segments in the area of the ribs — where about half of all spinal cord tumors occur — are the most sensitive to radiation's effects.\nWith all types of spinal cord tumors, corticosteroid drugs also may be prescribed to reduce spinal cord swelling. In addition, physical therapy may be needed to help a person regain muscle control and strength after radiation or surgery.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Back pain is a common problem and is rarely a sign of cancer. However, call your doctor for an evaluation of persistent or worsening back pain, especially if it keeps you awake at night. If you experience any numbness, tingling or weakness, call your doctor for an evaluation right away. This is particularly important for people who have had cancer in the past.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis will depend upon the location of the tumor on the spinal cord, the type of tumor and the size of the tumor at the time of diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment are vital to restoring function and preventing permanent damage to the spinal cord.\n",

      "What is a sprain?": "A sprain is an injury to ligaments, the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to one another at a joint. Normally, ligaments stabilize a joint, keep the joint's bones aligned and limit the motion of a joint to the normal range. When a joint is sprained, its torn or stretched ligaments can lose part or all of their ability to reinforce the joint and to keep it moving normally. In severe cases, the sprained joint can become unstable and loose, bones can move out of alignment, and the joint may extend beyond its normal range of motion.\nAlthough ligaments can be sprained in a variety of ways, the actual ligament damage is usually caused by at least one of the following:\nAny unusual force across a joint can cause a sprain. Among athletes, more than any other group, sprains are common. Knee sprains and shoulder sprains are common among those who participate in football, basketball, soccer, rugby, wrestling, gymnastics, and skiing. Foot sprains are a danger for ballet dancers, snowboarders, windsurfers, equestrians, and competitive divers. Wrist sprains are common in skiing, football, basketball, baseball, roller hockey, boxing, basketball, volleyball, and weightlifting. The specific joint that tends to be sprained during a particular sport is usually related to the kinds of joint movements that the sport requires, or to the types of impact or collision that can happen. For example, many knee sprains in football players are caused by the extreme knee stress of cutting moves and sharp turns. Others are caused by the direct impact of tackles.\nOff the playing field, sprains often occur because of high-impact accidents — for example, striking the knee on the dashboard during a car crash or slipping on a patch of ice and landing on a wrist or shoulder. Sprains are also common in the workplace.\n",
      "Symptoms of a sprain": "In general, sprains cause pain and swelling in the injured joint, along with some local joint tenderness. In moderate or severe sprains, there can also be deformity (a change in the joint's normal contour) and a noticeable change in the joint's function. This change in function can include a feeling that the joint is unstable or unreliable (for example, the knee feels as if it will buckle or give out); a feeling that the joint is too loose or that the bones are not aligned in their normal positions; or a change in the joint's normal range of motion.\nOther symptoms depend on the joint involved and the ligament that has been injured. For example, a sprain of the knee's anterior cruciate ligament can sideline an athlete immediately because of severe pain, swelling, and a feeling that the knee will give out. A sprain of the knee's posterior cruciate ligament, however, may cause only mild swelling that does not stop the athlete from continuing play.\n",
      "Diagnosing a sprain": "Information about exactly how you injured your joint is an important part of your evaluation. This information includes:\nAlso, as part of your basic evaluation, your health care professional will ask about your occupation, your routine recreational and sports activities, and any history of previous injuries to the injured joint. This will help to determine your risk of injuring the area again.\nIf you were injured during an athletic activity, your doctor may ask if there was an eyewitness who can provide details about your injury.\nBecause most joints come in pairs, your health care professional will compare your injured joint with your uninjured one. During the examination, your doctor will check your injured joint for swelling, deformity, tenderness, bruising, and skin injuries. If pain and swelling permit it, he or she also will evaluate your joint's range of motion and perform special maneuvers to check for joint instability and abnormal looseness. If your injury is severe, your doctor may recommend diagnostic tests, including:\nOnce your physical examination and any recommended testing are complete, your doctor may gauge the severity of your sprain according to a traditional grading system.\n\n\n\n",
      "Expected duration of a sprain": "How long a sprain lasts depends on many factors, including the location and severity of your sprain, how closely you follow your rehabilitation program, and your lifestyle (athletic or nonathletic). For example, symptoms of a Grade I wrist sprain may improve within just two or three days, while a Grade I shoulder sprain may take about two weeks. In the knee, a Grade I or II sprain of one of the collateral ligaments probably will heal within two to four weeks, but a severe (Grade III) sprain of the anterior cruciate ligament may take four to 12 months.\nIn general, rehabilitation programs are usually longest for athletes, especially athletes who play sports in which there is a high risk of injuring the sprained joint again.\n",
      "Preventing a sprain": "The best way to prevent sprains is to avoid accidents and injuries. To prevent sports-related sprains, you should:\n",
      "Treating a sprain": "If you have a Grade I or Grade II sprain, your health care professional probably will recommend that you follow theRICErule:\n\nDepending on the location of your sprain, your health care professional also may suggest that you wear a sling or a brace to temporarily reduce stress on the injured area. In addition, you can take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) to ease pain and relieve swelling. As your joint pain gradually subsides, your doctor may prescribe a rehabilitation program to strengthen the muscles around your injured joint. As nearby muscles get stronger, the joint becomes more stable, reducing the risk of injuring it again.\nIf you have a Grade III sprain, several different treatments can be used, depending on which ligament has been torn. Some torn ligaments can be repaired surgically with stitches, whereas others must be replaced surgically using either an autograft (a piece of your own tissue) or an allograft (a piece of donor tissue). Still others are treated with rehabilitation and temporary casting or bracing.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you injure a joint, call your doctor immediately if the joint:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is generally good for most Grade I or Grade II sprains. Overall, 80% to 90% of patients recover fully, depending on the specific ligament that was injured. Although most Grade III sprains also heal well, there may be a greater risk of troublesome long-term symptoms, especially chronic joint pain, persistent swelling, or some limitation of joint function. Without surgery, Grade III sprains may continue to cause symptoms of instability.\nAlso, as a long-term complication, some patients with sprains eventually develop symptoms of osteoarthritis in the injured joint. These symptoms may not start until 10 to 15 years after the initial injury.\n",

      "What is it?": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is a type of lung cancer. It occurs when abnormal lung cells multiply out of control and form a tumor. Eventually, tumor cells can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body including the\nIn general, there are two categories of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. The cancer cells in each type look different under the microscope. They are also treated differently. The prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer tends to be better than for small cell lung cancer; non-small cell lung cancers are more likely to be contained in one area, making treatment more likely to be successful.\nSquamous cell carcinoma is one type of non-small cell lung cancer. The others are:\nAdenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second-most common type. It accounts for about 30% of all cases of non-small cell lung cancer.\nYour risk of all types of lung cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, increase if you:\nMost cases of squamous cell carcinoma start in the center of the lungs. These tumors may cause some symptoms, such as coughing up blood, at an earlier stage than tumors on the edges of the lungs, such as adenocarcinomas.\nSquamous cell carcinoma often spreads (metastasizes) to other parts of the body because of the constant flow of fluids (blood and lymph) through the lungs. The fluids can carry cancer cells to nearby areas, such as the chest wall, neck, esophagus, and the protective sac around the heart. Unless it is diagnosed and treated early, it often spreads throughout the body.\nSome lung cancers have the ability to secrete chemicals that circulate in the bloodstream. These chemicals can change the way the body functions. Squamous cell lung cancer may secrete a substance that leads to abnormally high blood calcium levels. This can cause dehydration, constipation, kidney problems and confusion.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Early on, squamous cell lung cancer may have no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include:\nIf the cancer has spread beyond the lungs, it can cause other symptoms. For example, you may have bone pain if it has spread to your bones, or headaches and seizures if it has spread to your brain.\nMany of these symptoms can be caused by other conditions. See your doctor if you have symptoms so that the problem can be diagnosed and properly treated.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor may suspect lung cancer based on:\nTo look for evidence of cancer, your doctor will examine you, paying special attention to your throat, neck, lymph nodes and lungs. He or she will order imaging tests to check your lungs for masses. In most cases, a chest x-ray will be done first. If the x-ray shows anything suspicious, a CT scan will be done. As the scanner moves around you, it takes many pictures. A computer then combines the images. This creates a more detailed image of the lungs, allowing doctors to confirm the size and location of a mass or tumor.\nYou may also have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. MRI scans provide detailed pictures of the body's organs, but they use radio waves and magnets to create the images, not x-rays. PET scans look at the function of tissue rather than anatomy. Lung cancer tends to show intense metabolic activity on a PET scan. Some medical centers offer combined PET-CT scanning.\nIf cancer is suspected based on these images, more tests will be done to make the diagnosis, determine the type of cancer, and see if it has spread. These tests may include the following:\nOccasionally, surgery is done to remove the tumor first; the diagnosis is made after the tumor has been examined in a laboratory.\nAfter the cancer has been diagnosed, it is assigned a \"stage.\" The stages of squamous cell carcinoma reflect the tumor's size and how far the cancer has spread. Stages I through III are further divided into A and B categories.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Squamous cell lung cancer will continue to grow until it is treated. As with any cancer, even if it seems to be cured after treatment, this lung cancer can return.\n",
      "Prevention": "To reduce your risk of squamous cell lung cancer:\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults ages 50 to 80 years if you:\nThe decision to proceed with lung cancer screening is not straightforward. Many so-called abnormalities found on CT scan are not cancerous. However patients will often undergo extensive testing, including surgery, to find out. CT scan screening is an individualized decision to be made with your doctor.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the cancer's stage as well as the patient's condition, lung function, and other factors. (Some patients may have other lung conditions, such as emphysema or COPD—chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.) If the cancer has not spread, surgery is usually the treatment of choice. There are three types of surgery:\nLymph nodes are also removed and examined to see if the cancer has spread.\nSome surgeons use video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) to remove small, early-stage tumors, especially if the tumors are near the outer edge of the lung. (VATS can also be used to diagnose lung cancer.) Because the incisions for VATS are small, this technique is less invasive than a traditional \"open\" procedure.\nBecause surgery will remove part or all of a lung, breathing may be more difficult afterwards, especially in patients with other lung conditions (emphysema, for example). Doctors can test lung function prior to surgery and predict how it might be affected by surgery.\nDepending on how far the cancer has spread, treatment may include chemotherapy (the use of anticancer drugs) and radiation therapy. These may be given before and/or after surgery. Unfortunately, squamous cell carcinoma does not respond to chemotherapy and radiation therapy as well as other types of tumors.\nWhen the tumor has spread significantly, chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy may be recommended to slow its growth, even if it cannot cure the disease. These therapies have been shown to ease symptoms and prolong life in cases of advanced lung cancer. Radiation therapy can relieve symptoms, too. It is often used to treat lung cancer that has spread to the brain or bones and is causing pain. It can also be used alone or with chemotherapy to treat the lung cancer that is confined to the chest.\nPeople who may not withstand surgery due to other serious medical problems may receive radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy, to shrink the tumor.\nCancerous tissue may be tested for specific genetic abnormalities (mutations). Doctors may then be able to treat the cancer with a \"targeted therapy.\" These therapies can derail the cancer's growth by preventing or changing chemical reactions linked to particular mutations. For example, some target therapies prevent cancer cells from receiving chemical \"messages\" telling them to grow. However, these specific mutations tend to occur less frequently in squamous cell cancers compared to adenocarcinomas.\nKnowing about specific genetic mutations can help predict which therapy will be best. This strategy can be especially helpful in certain patients, such as women with adenocarcinoma of the lung who have never smoked.\nEven after treatment has been completed, lung cancer patients must return for regular follow-up appointments. Even if the cancer was initially placed into remission,\" it can return months or even years later.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have any of symptoms of squamous cell lung cancer, see your doctor as soon as possible.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Squamous cell lung cancer usually is diagnosed after the disease has spread, so the prognosis is often guarded. The survival rate is significantly higher if the disease is detected and treated early.\nEven when surgery and other therapies are initially successful, squamous cell lung cancer can return. This is because cancer cells can start to spread without being detected right away.\n",

      "What is it?": "A sty, also called hordeolum, is a small abscess of the oil gland associated with an eyelash hair follicle. It typically containsStaphylococcus aureusbacteria, the cause of staph infections. When a sty develops, a small area of the upper or lower eyelid or the corner of the eye becomes red, tender and swollen. Swelling subsides gradually over a period of days after the sty develops an opening, and the pus is able to drain out.\n\nA chalazion, like a sty, is a swelling within the eyelid caused by inflammation of an oil gland. A chalazion differs from a sty in that it does not contain an active bacterial infection. A chalazion is sometimes the after effect of a sty. It is less tender but lasts longer.\nNatural oils from the eyelid's oil glands must drain through ducts out to the eyelashes. If debris blocks this normal drainage, it may cause a sty or chalazion. Sometimes, this debris accumulates because of a condition called blepharitis, a long-standing inflammation of the edges of the eyelids, with redness, thickening and scales and crusts.\n",
      "Symptoms": "A sty or chalazion begins as a tender red lump or bump within the eyelid at the base of the eyelash. It may cause tearing, light sensitivity and the sensation of having something in the eye. Swelling usually involves only a small area of the lid, but in some cases it can lead to irritation and redness of the whole eyelid.\nA small, yellowish spot eventually appears in the center of a sty, when the pus collection expands to become visible just beneath the skin or eyelid surface. Pain usually is relieved when the sty ruptures, draining the pus through an opening in the skin, the lid margin or the undersurface of the lid.\nA chalazion at first may be red and swollen for a few days, but eventually it changes to a painless, slowly growing, round mass in the lid. The skin around this firm rubbery lump can be moved loosely over the swelling.\n\n",
      "Diagnosis": "You or your doctor can diagnose a sty or chalazion by looking at it. Both styes and chalazions usually go away on their own without medical attention.\n",
      "Expected duration": "A sty usually goes away in a week or two. Chalazions generally take longer, disappearing after a month or more. Warm compresses can help both styes and chalazions go away sooner.\n",
      "Prevention": "Good hygiene is the best way to prevent styes and chalazions. Keep your hands clean, don't rub your eyes, and don't share eye makeup. This is particularly important for people who have had styes or chalazions more than once.\n",
      "Treatment": "Warm compresses can help styes and chalazions heal faster. Moisten a clean, folded washcloth with warm water and hold it gently against the eye for 5 minutes several times a day for several days. The moist washcloth can be heated in a microwave over. This will encourage a sty or chalazion to open a drainage channel, allowing any pus to drain away and restoring normal drainage from oil glands. Change the washcloth frequently, particularly as a sty drains.\nPus should never be removed by squeezing. A sty that fails to drain can be lanced (opened) by a doctor.\nIf a chalazion does not go away on its own after six weeks, it may need to be treated surgically under local anesthesia.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Seek medical attention if a lump or bump on the eyelid impairs vision, or if it does not go away on its own after one week of treatment with warm compresses. Very rarely, a tumor of the eyelid can look like a chalazion. If redness spreads to the entire lid, you should arrange for prompt examination by a doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most styes will resolve within one week of treatment with warm compresses. Chalazions take longer to resolve, sometimes more than a couple months. Persistent chalazions may need treatment by an ophthalmalogist.\n",

      "What Is It?": "A subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding from a damaged artery at the surface of the brain. This bleeding often causes a sudden, severe headache. It is a medical emergency. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a type of stroke. It can cause permanent brain damage.\nBlood from a subarachnoid hemorrhage pulses into the space between the brain and the skull. It mixes with the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain and spinal cord. As blood flows into the cerebral spinal fluid, it increases the pressure that surrounds the brain. The increased pressure can interfere with brain function.\nIn the days that immediately follow the bleeding, chemical irritation from clotted blood around the brain can cause brain arteries to go into spasm. An artery spasm can cause additional new brain damage.\nMost often, a subarachnoid hemorrhage happens because a bulge in the wall of an artery ruptures. The sac-like bulge is called a saccular aneurysm. A subarachnoid hemorrhage also can occur because blood leaks from an abnormal tangle of blood vessels called an arteriovenous malformation (AVM).\nRuptured Aneurysm\nSeveral large arteries form a circle at the base of your brain. When a subarachnoid hemorrhage is caused by a ruptured saccular aneurysm, the aneurysm usually is located where a blood vessel branches from one of these large arteries. About 20% of patients who have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have multiple aneurysms.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict whether an aneurysm will rupture, an aneurysm is more likely to rupture when it has a diameter of 7 millimeters or more. In most cases, a person who has a brain aneurysm never has a symptom related to it.\nLeaking AVM\nAn AVM is a tangled, abnormal mesh of blood vessels that connects an artery and a vein in the brain. AVMs form accidentally prior to birth. An AVM can form almost anywhere in the brain or spinal cord, but they usually are near the back of the brain.\nAVMs can appear in several generations of the same family and are more common in men. Bleeding from an AVM most often occurs between the ages of 10 and 30. If an AVM is too deep to cause bleeding onto the outer surface of the brain (a subarachnoid hemorrhage), it can cause bleeding inside the brain itself (intracerebral hemorrhage).\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage can include:\nIf you have only a small subarachnoid hemorrhage, you may have several of these symptoms, particularly a severe headache that starts suddenly. However, your symptoms may improve on their own. This can be a critical warning sign, called a sentinel headache. People who have a small subarachnoid hemorrhage may have a second hemorrhage within the next week if they do not get medical treatment.\nIn the several days that follow a subarachnoid hemorrhage, it is possible to develop more typical symptoms of a stroke, from damage of specific areas of the brain. Examples of these symptoms include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If you have a subarachnoid hemorrhage, you will be ill enough that you need to be evaluated in an emergency room. The doctor will do a physical examination, including a neurological examination, and will check to see if your neck movement is limited or uncomfortable, which can be a sign that there is an irritant such as blood in the spinal fluid.\nOne of two brain imaging tests will be used: either a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. CT scans provide an image more quickly.\nA lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap, can confirm that you have a subarachnoid hemorrhage even when the hemorrhage is too small to appear on a CT scan. This test also can test whether you have meningitis, an infection that can cause similar symptoms. During a lumbar puncture, a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid is removed through a needle inserted into your back. This fluid is examined to see if it contains blood.\nTwo other tests, called brain angiography and MRI angiography, can evaluate blood flow patterns within your brain. One of these tests can be used to detect an aneurysm or AVM abnormality.\nYou also may have an electrocardiogram (EKG). The dramatic stress on the brain during a subarachnoid hemorrhage can trigger chemical changes within your heart muscle. These changes can stress the heart muscle and may result in a heart attack, even if your heart arteries are not narrowed by atherosclerosis.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "For those who survive a subarachnoid hemorrhage, recovery is slow. Most people do not recover complete functioning within months of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Up to 50% of people who survive subarachnoid hemorrhage will have neurological disabilities that last much longer or become permanent.\n",
      "Prevention": "It is almost impossible to prevent subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm or AVM. These blood vessel abnormalities usually do not cause any symptoms before the hemorrhage occurs. Smoking has been shown to increase the risk of forming an aneurysm, so avoiding smoking may prevent some cases of hemorrhagic stroke.\nSome people have proposed screening tests, such as MRI angiography, that would identify aneurysms before they cause a problem. However, this idea has been impractical for most people, because surgery to remove an aneurysm can leave you with decreased function after your recovery. For most people, this is a risk that is not worth taking, since most aneurysms never cause serious bleeding.\nScreening and surgery are not recommended for people who have a single close relative who has a brain aneurysm or a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Screening and surgery may make sense for people who have two or more close relatives who have had bleeding, since this family is at an especially high risk. Because aneurysm screening is controversial, you should consider the risks of surgery carefully with your doctor before you ask for a screening test.\n",
      "Treatment": "When a large hemorrhage occurs in or around the brain, the entire brain is in danger because of increasing pressure within the skull. Much of the emergency treatment for hemorrhagic stroke involves measuring and lowering this pressure. Depending upon the patient's level of consciousness and intracranial pressure, he or she may need to be hooked up to a breathing machine. Also intravenous medications can be given to decrease the pressure.\nBlood pressure must be kept in a tight range. Blood pressure that gets too low can be even more dangerous than high readings.\nSubarachnoid hemorrhages commonly cause arteries nearest to the site of bleeding to spasm and become narrower. The calcium channel blocker called nimodipine is usually given to help prevent the spasm from further damaging the brain.\nA subarachnoid hemorrhage frequently causes shifts in the level of blood chemicals called electrolytes. Your doctor will adjust the amount of chemicals in the intravenous fluids based upon results of daily blood tests.\nIf bleeding occurred because of an abnormally formed blood vessel, you will likely need a procedure to prevent recurrent bleeding. Ideally the procedure is performed when your condition is more stable.\nFor an aneurysm, your doctor may recommend endovascular coiling or aneurysm clipping.\nAn AVM sometimes can be destroyed by a carefully directed beam of radiation or can be removed through surgery. Another technique is called embolization. A catheter is threaded through a blood vessel and guided to the AVM. The doctor injects special material or a chemical into the AVM to block off blood supply.\nOccupational and physical therapy will likely be needed if neurological impairment has occurred. The therapists are professionals who help the person improve daily function and regain strength after brain injury. Commonly, hospitalization is followed by a period of residence at a rehabilitation center, where additional intensive therapy may be provided. The goal of rehabilitation is to help the patient recover as much physical and speaking function as possible.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Call for emergency help immediately whenever a friend or family member shows any unexpected symptoms that suggest to you they may be having a subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially if that person loses consciousness or suddenly develops a seizure. Call your own doctor promptly or have a friend bring you to the emergency room if you develop a severe headache and you are vomiting. Less-intense headaches should be evaluated by your doctor if you have them often or if they are accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, weakness or numbness in any part of the body.\nIf you have a sudden, very severe headache but it goes away, it is critically important to discuss this with your doctor. Sometimes blood leaks briefly from a blood vessel 6 to 20 days before a subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs. The headache this leak causes is called a sentinel headache. Your doctor may be able to provide treatment that can prevent more serious bleeding.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Many patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage do not survive long enough to reach a hospital. Of those who do, the prognosis depends upon the severity of the initial brain damage. If the person is awake and has minimal or no neurological abnormalities, the immediate prognosis is good. However, the person's condition can change rapidly.\nWithout treatment of an aneurysm or AVM that bled, the risk of rebleeding is significant. Successful treatment greatly lowers this risk.\n",

      "What is it?": "A subdural hematoma occurs when a blood vessel near the surface of the brain bursts. Blood builds up between the brain and the brain's tough outer lining. The condition is also called a subdural hemorrhage.\nIn a subdural hematoma, blood collects immediately beneath the dura mater. The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges. The meninges is the three-layer protective covering of the brain.\nA subdural hematoma is a life-threatening problem because it can compress the brain.\n\nMost subdural hemorrhages result from trauma to the head. The trauma damages tiny veins within the meninges.\nIn young, healthy people, bleeding usually is triggered by a significant impact. This type of impact might occur in a high-speed motor vehicle accident.\nIn contrast, older people may bleed after only a minor trauma. For example, it might happen from falling out of a chair.\nA subdural hematoma is also more common in people\nAn acute subdural hemorrhage is bleeding that develops shortly after a serious blow to the head. Blood accumulates rapidly, causing pressure to rise within the brain. This can result in loss of consciousness, paralysis, or death.\nWhen bleeding develops slowly, it is known as a chronic subdural hemorrhage. Bleeding may develop over a period of weeks to months.\nThis form of bleeding is much more common in older people. The head trauma that causes chronic subdural hemorrhage is often minor. Many of those affected cannot recall a head injury.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Acute subdural hemorrhage usually develops after severe head trauma. Injuries that result in this condition are typically forceful enough to cause a temporary loss of consciousness.\nUsually, in the minutes to hours after head injury, the person recovers consciousness. Then, the person gradually loses consciousness again, this time from subdural bleeding.\nOther common symptoms of an acute subdural hemorrhage include\nChronic subdural hemorrhages produce more subtle symptoms. These symptoms may continue for more than a month before the diagnosis is recognized.\nThese symptoms include\nThe symptoms caused by chronic subdural hemorrhage can mimic other common conditions. For example, they may resemble strokes and brain tumors. Occasionally, the gradual memory loss and personality changes can be mistaken for dementia.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "All head injuries should be evaluated promptly by a physician. This is especially true if there has been any loss of consciousness.\nA doctor usually will want to know\nThe doctor will perform a thorough physical and neurological exam. He or she will check\nIf the doctor suspects bleeding in the head, he or she will usually order a computer tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan is the fastest way to determine the location and amount of bleeding. It can also identify any injuries to the brain, skull, or neck. If needed, a brain MRI might also be performed.\n\nA doctor may suspect a chronic subdural hemorrhage if an older patient develops new neurological symptoms. This is more likely if there has been a fall or minor trauma to the head.\n",
      "Expected duration": "An acute subdural hemorrhage develops over minutes to hours. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, it can cause severe brain injury and sometimes death.\nA chronic subdural hemorrhage develops over many days to weeks. The symptoms may be subtle and develop so slowly that the person and family are not alarmed.\nAs is the case with any brain injury, symptoms can be slow to go away after treatment. Some symptoms may be permanent.\nOccasionally, a subdural hematoma is small enough that you may not need surgery to remove the blood. The blood will be reabsorbed gradually by the body. This process may require a few months. But it is sometimes the safest treatment plan.\n",
      "Prevention": "Accidents, including head injuries, are the leading cause of death in young people. Many of these accidents are related to drugs and alcohol. Many others could be prevented with simple precautions or safety equipment.\nTo help prevent head injuries:\n\"Blood-thinning\" medications increase your risk of bleeding within the head. Examples include\n",
      "Treatment": "An acute subdural hemorrhage requires immediate medical attention. In most cases, emergency surgery must be done to drain the hematoma and to control bleeding.\nIn contrast, only some chronic subdural hemorrhages require emergency surgery. Most physicians will recommend surgery for larger hemorrhages and those that cause neurological symptoms. However, treatment with bed rest, medications, and observation may be reasonable in some cases. This may be the case for smaller hematomas that cause minimal or no symptoms.\nPeople who develop a subdural hemorrhage are at risk of seizures. Seizures may occur even after the hematoma has been treated.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call for emergency assistance if you find someone unconscious at an accident scene.\nAlso seek immediate attention if someone with a head injury experiences\nEven if a head injury appears minor, with mild symptoms, certain people are at high risk of serious bleeding. Call a doctor or go to an emergency room immediately if a person with head injury also:\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for acute subdural hemorrhages generally is guarded and some people die even with prompt surgery. Usually there are injuries to other parts of the brain from the trauma. This tends to be true regardless of the size of the hematoma. Many of those who survive may be left with permanent neurological problems.\nThe prognosis for an acute or chronic subdural hematoma is best in people who:\nThe prognosis for chronic subdural hemorrhage is quite favorable. Most people are able to resume their level of previous functioning.\n",

      "What is a sun allergy?": "Despite the name, a \"sun allergy\" is not truly an allergy to the sun. Instead, it is an immune system reaction in the skin triggered by sunlight, most often causing an itchy red rash. The medical term for this condition is Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE). The most common locations include the \"V\" of the neck, the back of the hands, the outside surface of the arms and the lower legs. In rare cases, the skin reaction may be more severe, producing hives or small blisters that may even spread to skin in clothed areas.\nSun allergies are triggered by changes that occur in sun-exposed skin. It is not clear why the body develops this reaction. However, the immune system recognizes some components of the sun-altered skin as \"foreign,\" and the body activates its immune defenses against them. This produces an allergic reaction that takes the form of a rash, tiny blisters or, rarely, some other type of skin eruption.\nSun allergies occur only in certain sensitive people, and in some cases, they can be triggered by only a few brief moments of sun exposure. Some forms of sun allergy are inherited.\nA few of the most common types of sun allergy are:\n",
      "Symptoms of sun allergy": "Symptoms vary, depending on the specific type of sun allergy:\n",
      "Diagnosing sun allergy": "If you have mild symptoms of PMLE, you may be able to diagnose the problem yourself by asking yourself the following questions:\nIf you can answer \"yes\" to all of these questions, then you may have mild PMLE.\nIf you have more severe sun-related symptoms — especially hives, blisters or small areas of bleeding under the skin — your doctor will need to make the diagnosis. In most cases, your doctor can confirm that you have PMLE or actinic prurigo based on your symptoms, your medical history, family history (especially American Indian ancestry) and a simple examination of your skin. Sometimes, additional tests may be necessary, including:\nIf you have symptoms of a photoallergic eruption, the diagnosis may take some detective work. Your doctor will begin by reviewing your current medicines as well as any skin lotions, sunscreens or colognes you use. The doctor may suggest that you temporarily switch to an alternate medication or eliminate certain skin care products to see whether this makes your skin symptoms subside. If necessary, your doctor will refer you to a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in skin disorders. The dermatologist may do photopatch testing, a diagnostic procedure that exposes a small area of your skin to a combination of both ultraviolet light and a small amount of test chemical, usually a medicine or ingredient in a skin care product.\nIf you have symptoms of solar urticaria, your doctor may confirm the diagnosis by using photo-testing to reproduce your hives.\n",
      "Expected duration of sun allergy": "How long the reaction lasts depends on the type of sun allergy:\n",
      "Preventing sun allergy": "To help prevent symptoms of a sun allergy, you must protect your skin from exposure to sunlight. Try the following suggestions:\n",
      "Treating sun allergy": "If you have a sun allergy, your treatment must always begin with the strategies described in the Prevention section. These will reduce your sun exposure and prevent your symptoms from worsening. Other treatments depend on the specific type of sun allergy:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your primary care doctor or a dermatologist if you have:\nCall for emergency help immediately if you suddenly develop hives together with swelling around your eyes or lips, faintness or difficulty breathing or swallowing. These may be signs of a life-threatening allergic reaction.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If you have a sun allergy, the outlook is usually very good, especially if you consistently use sunscreens and protective clothing. Most people with PMLE or actinic prurigo improve significantly within five to seven years after diagnosis, and almost everyone with photoallergic eruption can be cured by avoiding the specific chemical that triggers the sun allergy.\nOf all forms of sun allergy, solar urticaria is the one that is most likely to be a long-term problem. However, in some people the condition eventually subsides.\n",

      "What is it?": "Although most people love the warmth and light of the sun, too much sun exposure can significantly damage human skin. The sun's heat dries out areas of unprotected skin and depletes the skin's supply of natural lubricating oils. In addition, the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation can cause burning and long-term changes in the skin's structure.\nThe most common types of sun damage to the skin are:\nImage: Douceflour/Getty Images\nOver a lifetime, repeated episodes of sunburn and unprotected sun exposure can increase a person's risk of malignant melanoma and other forms of skin cancer. As a rule, if you have fair skin and light eyes, you are at greater risk of sun-related skin damage and skin cancers. This is because your skin contains less of a dark pigment called melanin, which helps to protect the skin from the effects of UV radiation.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Sun-damaged skin shows the following symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "In most cases, your doctor can confirm that you have sun-damaged skin simply by examining the area. Often, a biopsy is done to rule out skin cancer in a patch of actinic keratosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed and examined in a laboratory.\n",
      "Expected duration": "The painful redness of sunburn will fade within a few days, provided that you do not re-expose your injured skin to the sun without using a sunblock or sunscreen. Some sun damage is permanent, although prescription medications, nonprescription remedies and skin-resurfacing treatments may improve the skin's appearance.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent sun-damaged skin by taking the following steps:\nTo help detect actinic keratoses and other skin abnormalities in their earliest stages, examine your entire skin surface thoroughly every one to two months. Check for patches of discolored or scaly skin, moles, small pearly nodules, sores and other skin abnormalities on all parts of your body, including your scalp and genitals. Use a mirror to inspect harder-to-see areas of your back, shoulders, upper arms, buttocks and the soles of your feet. People who have numerous actinic keratoses should have their skin checked by a doctor at least twice a year.\n",
      "Treatment": "The type of treatment depends on the form of sun damage:\nAlso, because an actinic keratosis is a sign that you are at increased risk of skin cancer, your doctor will schedule regular follow-up skin examinations to check periodically for new areas of abnormal skin.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your primary care physician or a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin problems) if you have any of the following problems:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Sun damage may result in a permanent cosmetic concern. Some treatments for actinic keratoses can leave a pale (de-pigmented) area of the skin surface. More important than appearance is the long-term impact of sun damage on your chances of developing skin cancer. The more unprotected sun exposure you have during your lifetime, the greater your risk of skin cancer, especially if you have a light complexion.\n",

      "What is it?": "Thrombophlebitis is a blood clot (thrombus) inside an inflamed vein. When it affects the body's superficial veins — those that are seen easily near the surface of the skin — it's known as superficial thrombophlebitis. Thrombophlebitis is very common in people who have varicose veins. However, it also can occur in people with medical conditions that lead to sluggish blood flow in the legs, especially pregnant women and people who are immobilized because of stroke or cancer. People who receive injections or medications intravenously (into a vein) also are more likely to get thrombophlebitis because their veins can become irritated by the tubes used or by the medication itself. Intravenous drug users are at high risk of a very serious type of thrombophlebitis that can develop into a vein infection.\nThrombophlebitis in a superficial leg vein is not the same as deep vein thrombosis. Deep vein thrombosis is a serious condition that is not treated with simple local therapy. It requires administration of anti-clotting drugs.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Thrombophlebitis causes pain in the area of the clotted vein, together with redness and sometimes swelling in the surrounding skin.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor looks for redness, warmth, swelling and tenderness in the affected vein and in the surrounding skin. The clotted and inflamed vein also can be very firm and can feel like a hard line or string under the skin.\nYour doctor usually can diagnose thrombophlebitis with a simple physical examination. In people with many episodes of thrombophlebitis, or with thrombophlebitis involving more than one vein, further tests may be necessary to check for problems with blood flow in the veins.\n",
      "Expected duration": "With treatment, most episodes of thrombophlebitis resulting from varicose veins, sluggish blood flow, or irritation from administration of intravenous medications typically heal quickly, usually within a few days. Thrombophlebitis resulting from vein infection requires longer treatment.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you are pregnant or have varicose veins, you can help to relieve sluggish blood flow in your legs by wearing elastic support stockings or graduated compression stockings, as your doctor directs. Avoid prolonged periods of standing and, if possible, elevate your legs when you sit. Regular exercise, especially walking, also can help to improve blood flow.\nTo prevent thrombophlebitis from infection, avoid injecting illegal drugs into your veins.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment is very effective for most simple cases of thrombophlebitis. For leg vein thrombophlebitis, treatment includes bed rest, elevating the legs and applying warm compresses. In some cases, wrapping the legs with an elastic bandage and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) also can help. In patients with varicose veins who have had several episodes of thrombophlebitis, the affected veins can be surgically \"stripped,\" a procedure in which the vein is tied off, cut and removed through a small incision.\nIf the vein becomes infected, you will be treated with antibiotics. Mild cases can be treated with oral medications, but more severe cases usually require antibiotics given intravenously (into a vein) or by injection.\nIn patients with superficial thrombophlebitis that is not improving with standard therapy, anticoagulant (anti-clotting) medication sometimes is used to prevent blood clots from extending into the deeper leg veins. Blood clots in the deep leg veins, a condition called deep vein thrombosis, can lead to blood clots, called emboli, that float in the bloodstream. These blood clots can travel to the lungs, which can be life threatening.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have pain, redness or swelling along the length of a vein.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In pregnant women, thrombophlebitis is often a short-term condition that doesn't return after delivery. In people with varicose veins, thrombophlebitis may not return as long as the patient wears support stockings, walks regularly, and elevates the legs while sitting.\n",

      "What is it?": "Young children, and sometimes older children and adults, may swallow toys, coins, safety pins, buttons, bones, wood, glass, magnets, batteries or other foreign objects. These objects often pass all the way through the digestive tract in 24 to 48 hours and cause no harm.\nBut problems may arise when objects are stuck for a long time, are sharp, are magnetic or contain corrosive materials. Complications can include tears in the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth and stomach), movement of the object into the tissue of the esophagus, and infection. Small magnets can pose a special problem. If more than one is swallowed, they can stick together and erode through tissue.\nThree areas of the esophagus are the most likely places for objects to lodge:\nObjects also may get stuck in any part of the esophagus that has been injured previously.\n",
      "Symptoms": "If the object gets caught in the esophagus, it can cause:\nObjects also can become trapped in the intestine or can tear the intestinal walls. The result can be vomiting, abdominal pain, abnormal bowel sounds and dark stools that contain blood.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "After your doctor examines your child and asks about his or her recent medical history, the doctor may order an X-ray to help show where the object is. Some things cannot be seen with an X-ray. If the X-ray does not show the object, but the symptoms and circumstances still suggest that an object is stuck in the esophagus, the child may need a computerized tomography (CT) scan, or other radiologic tests.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Most objects that do not cause symptoms will pass through the digestive tract in one or two days without causing harm.\n",
      "Prevention": "Keep all small objects such as coins, pins, magnets, small toy pieces and batteries away from young children, especially those younger than age 3.\n",
      "Treatment": "If your child has swallowed a foreign object, call your doctor for advice, and:\nSometimes, the object must be removed either endoscopically or surgically. This is done under anesthesia.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If your child swallows a battery, magnet or an object larger than a quarter, contact your doctor immediately or bring them to a local emergency room, even if your child has no symptoms. The same is true if your child has swallowed something sharp, such as a piece of glass or an open safety pin. Sharp objects sometimes can injure the esophagus, stomach or intestines.\nIf your child has swallowed a smooth object that is smaller than a quarter, and has no symptoms, contact your doctor to decide the best course of action. You may be able to wait and see if the object passes through the digestive tract on its own. If more than 24 to 48 hours pass and you do not see the object in the toilet or in your child's diaper, or if your child begins experiencing symptoms of a lodged object, contact your doctor.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases the outlook is excellent; the object will pass on its own or can be removed without complications.\nComplications from endoscopy or surgery can include bleeding, tears in the esophagus or intestine, infection or complications from the anesthesia. These complications are uncommon, and usually treatable.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Otitis externa is an infection of the ear canal caused by bacteria or fungi. It often is called swimmer's ear because it is associated with frequent swimming. Prolonged exposure to water, which may contain certain bacteria, makes the skin of the ear canal swollen and more likely to get infected. Summer humidity also changes the skin of the ear canal, increasing the possibility of infection.\nWhile swimmer's ear is most common in the summer, it can happen any time of the year. People with skin conditions such as eczema and seborrhea may be more prone to infections. Others who are more likely to develop swimmer's ear include people who:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of swimmer's ear include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Swimmer's ear usually is diagnosed by examining the ear with a special viewing tool called an otoscope. The doctor looks for:\nIn rare cases, a culture of the drainage is necessary. For a culture, a sample of the draining fluid is treated in a laboratory to see what bacteria or fungi grow. Your doctor also may examine the eardrum to look for signs of middle ear infection.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "With treatment, symptoms usually improve within 1 to 3 days and go away completely in 7 to 10 days. The problem can return, especially if you don't take steps to prevent getting water in the ear canals repeatedly.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent swimmer's ear:\n",
      "Treatment": "Swimmer's ear usually is treated with prescription eardrops. The most commonly used drops combine either acetic acid or an antibiotic with a corticosteroid to calm the inflammation. There are multiple commercial combinations available.\nDrops usually are placed in the ear canal three or four times per day for about five days. Follow the instructions on your prescription.\nIn the past, the most commonly prescribed topical treatment was a combination of neomycin, polymixin and hydrocortisone. In people who are allergic to neomycin, the use of these drops may cause the ear canal to become red and swell. The reaction may extend to the outer ear and surrounding skin and may be accompanied by blisters. If you get a reaction like this, stop using the eardrops and contact your doctor immediately.\nIn some cases of swimmer's ear, swelling may make it difficult for the medicated drops to get down into the ear canal. In these cases, your doctor may place a wick in the ear canal to help the eardrops get deeper into the canal. For very severe cases, your doctor may prescribe an oral or intravenous antibiotic.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "The treatment of swimmer's ear usually requires prescription medication. Call your doctor if you or your child has symptoms of this condition.\nWith treatment, symptoms usually improve within 24 hours and go away in two or three days. If you currently are being treated for swimmer's ear, call your doctor for follow-up if:\nSome people, particularly those who have diabetes or other immune system problems, can develop a severe form of this condition known as malignant otitis externa that requires immediate hospitalization for treatment with intravenous antibiotics. If you have diabetes or another condition that makes you more susceptible to infections, contact your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms of swimmer's ear.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Uncomplicated cases of swimmer's ear should go away within five days with appropriate treatment. Muffled hearing should return to normal as the swelling subsides.\n",

      "What is syphilis?": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a type of bacteria calledTreponema pallidum. In its earliest stage, syphilis produces an open sore (ulcer) that leaks fluid filled with syphilis bacteria. Syphilis can be transmitted by contact with this ulcer or other infectious sores that form later in the disease, usually during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If untreated, syphilis moves through a series of stages that affect different parts of the body, although the stages can overlap:\nPregnant women with syphilis can pass the bacteria to their babies, causing a condition known as congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis causes a variety of skin and organ problems in infants, and it can be deadly. Pregnant women with syphilis also have about a 40% chance of having a baby that is stillborn.\nIf you are infected with syphilis, it may be easier for you to become infected with HIV. If you already have HIV, a syphilis infection may make you more likely to spread HIV to others.\n",
      "Symptoms of syphilis": "The symptoms of syphilis vary depending on the stage of the illness:\n",
      "Primary syphilis": "Usually, a single ulcer (chancre) appears at the site where the bacteria entered the body. The genitals are the most common location for chancres to develop, but these ulcers also can form around the mouth or anus. The chancre is firm and painless, and it oozes fluid that contains syphilis bacteria. Sometimes, lymph nodes near the ulcer become enlarged, but remain painless. The chancre of primary syphilis usually heals after one to five weeks, although the person remains infected.\n",
      "Secondary syphilis": "Typical symptoms of secondary syphilis are:\nWithout treatment, rash symptoms usually go away after two to six weeks.\nOther symptoms can include:\nWithout treatment, these other symptoms generally last about one year.\n",
      "Latent stage": "This stage does not cause any symptoms.\n",
      "Tertiary syphilis": "In this stage, syphilis causes symptoms related to severe organ damage. These symptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosing syphilis": "If your doctor suspects that you have syphilis, he or she will look for any of the typical symptoms of the infection, especially for a chancre in the genital area. Your doctor can diagnose syphilis by taking a sample of fluid from a suspicious ulcer and having that fluid examined under a microscope for the presence of syphilis bacteria.\nYour doctor also may order blood tests to check for certain antibodies that are present in people with syphilis. However, in some cases, people without syphilis test positive for these antibodies. A positive test may have to be confirmed with a second blood test.\nBecause of the high risk of HIV infection in people with syphilis, public-health officials recommend that all people infected with syphilis should be tested for HIV infection.\n",
      "Expected duration of syphilis": "Unless treated, syphilis is a lifelong illness.\n",
      "Preventing syphilis": "A person who has symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis can pass a syphilis infection to his or her sex partner. During sexual intercourse, the bacteria can pass from sores to the uninfected sexual partner through tiny breaks in the skin. To prevent this from happening, a person infected with syphilis (and his or her sexual partners) should abstain from sexual activity until after the completion of treatment for the infection. Every pregnant woman should have a blood test for syphilis to prevent passing the infection to her baby.\n",
      "Treating syphilis": "People with primary syphilis can usually be cured with a single injection of a long-acting penicillin. People in later stages require longer treatment with penicillin. Other antibiotics, including doxycycline, azithromycin or ceftriaxone may be effective for people who are allergic to penicillin. All sex partners of people with syphilis should be treated as well. Babies born with congenital syphilis should be treated with a course of penicillin.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if you develop any of the symptoms of syphilis, especially if you are pregnant. If you have a sex partner who is diagnosed with syphilis, contact your doctor immediately so that you can be treated for syphilis.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With proper antibiotic treatment, early syphilis infection can be cured without causing permanent damage. Although later stages of syphilis also respond to antibiotics, treatment will not repair any organ damage caused by the disease. Without treatment, about one-third of patients with latent syphilis develop tertiary syphilis, and these patients risk severe organ damage and death.\n",

      "What is it?": "Tachycardia is a heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute. The heart normally beats at a rate of 60 to 100 times per minute, and the pulse (felt at the wrist, neck or elsewhere) matches the contractions of the heart's ventricles, the heart's two powerful lower chambers.\nTachycardia can be part of the body's normal response to anxiety, fever, rapid blood loss or strenuous exercise. It also can be caused by medical problems, such as an abnormally high level of thyroid hormones, called hyperthyroidism. In some people, tachycardia is the result of a cardiac arrhythmia (a heart-generated abnormality of heart rate or rhythm). Tachycardia can also be caused by lung problems, such as pneumonia or a blood clot in one of the lung's arteries.\nIn other cases, tachycardia can be a side effect of some foods and drinks, including coffee, tea, alcohol and chocolate; tobacco; or medication.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Tachycardia can be part of the body's normal response to anxiety, fever, rapid blood loss or strenuous exercise.

Tachycardia can also be caused by lung problems, such as pneumonia or a blood clot in one of the lung's arteries.\nIn other cases, tachycardia may be a side effect of caffeinated drinks, alcohol, illegal substances, or medication.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you to describe your symptoms. He or she will review your personal medical history and potential causes of tachycardia, including lung disease, thyroid disorders, and medications. Your doctor will want to know if you have a family history of heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias.\nDuring the physical examination, your doctor will check your heart rate and rhythm. Your doctor also will check for an enlarged heart, for heart murmurs (one sign of a heart valve problem), for abnormal lung sounds and for physical signs of thyroid abnormalities (enlarged thyroid gland, hand tremor and an abnormal protrusion of the eyes).\nTo further evaluate your tachycardia, your doctor will order an electrocardiogram (EKG). However, because some forms of tachycardia come and go, a one-time office EKG may be normal. If this is the case, you may need a test called ambulatory electrocardiography. For this test, you will wear a portable device that can continuously monitor your heart rate and rhythm. You press a button to record EKG readings when symptoms occur.\nDepending on the results of your physical examination, other tests may be necessary, such as blood tests to measure your red blood cell count and levels of thyroid hormones and an echocardiogram to see if there are any structural abnormalities of your heart. Sometimes, physicians do \"electrophysiology testing,\" in which they insert special catheters within the heart to collect information on the patterns of the heart's electrical activities.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long tachycardia lasts depends on its cause. For example, tachycardia resulting from fever will go away when body temperature returns to normal. Tachycardia resulting from blood loss will end when the patient is stabilized with intravenous (IV) fluids and/or blood transfusions. Tachycardia resulting from hyperthyroidism or an adrenal gland tumor will go away when the disorder is treated. Tachycardia caused by medications or diet will go away quickly, usually within hours, when the chemical that is causing the problem is used up by the body or excreted in the urine. Tachycardia caused by cardiac problems can last a long time.\n",
      "Prevention": "Since tachycardia is usually a sign of some underlying medical problem, discovering and treating the cause is the best way to prevent recurrent tachycardia.\nThe first episode of an arrhythmia that causes a rapid heart beat usually cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of tachycardia depends on its cause. For example:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you experience unexplained tachycardia, not the normal increase in heart rate after exercise. This is especially important if you also have palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells, fatigue, breathlessness or chest pain.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The long-term outlook is usually good when tachycardia is caused by fever, blood loss, hyperthyroidism, medication or diet. Many tachycardias related to heart or lung problems can be controlled with medication, surgery or other procedures.\n",

      "What is it?": "Takayasu's arteritis is a chronic (long-term) disease in which arteries become inflamed. It is also known as Takayasu's aortitis, pulseless disease, and aortic arch syndrome. The name comes from the doctor who first reported the problem in 1905, Dr. Mikito Takayasu.\nIn most cases, Takayasu's arteritis targets the aorta and its major branches, including arteries to the brain, arms, and kidneys. The aorta is the body's main artery, which pumps oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Less frequently, the pulmonary artery and coronary arteries also are involved. This problem causes damage to the body's major organs; reduced or absent pulses in the arms and legs; and symptoms of poor circulation, such as a cool or cold arm or leg, muscle pains with use or exertion, or symptoms of stroke if brain arteries are narrowed or blocked. Over time, Takayasu's arteritis can cause scarring, narrowing, and abnormal ballooning of involved blood vessels. The disease can be fatal.\nAlthough the cause of Takayasu's arteritis is unknown, it may be an autoimmune disorder, meaning that immune defenses attack the body's own cells rather than protecting them from outside invaders. Researchers have identified a number of genes that appear to increase the risk of developing this disease.\nIn Asia, Takayasu's arteritis is a major cause of high blood pressure in teenagers and young adults. In North America and Europe, however, Takayasu's arteritis is a very rare illness that affects only two or three of every one million people every year. It is eight times more common in females than in males. Although 75% of people begin to have symptoms during their teenage years, the average age at which the problem is diagnosed is usually much later at age 29. This is because early symptoms of Takayasu's arteritis are more general and common, such as fatigue. Up to 96% of people are not diagnosed until they have later, more specific symptoms.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of Takayasu's arteritis vary depending on the stage of the illness and the arteries affected. Early symptoms can include fever, fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss, night sweats, joint pain, and chest pain. Later symptoms typically are related to narrowing of the arteries and a decrease in blood flow to certain organs. These later symptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Because Takayasu's arteritis is so rare and because the early symptoms are not specific, a doctor may not suspect you have the disease until you develop symptoms of narrowed arteries. This could be months, or even years, after the disease started.\nThe earliest clues that you may have Takayasu's arteritis may be high blood pressure that can't be explained by anything else, difficulty obtaining a blood pressure measurement on one side, a difference in blood pressure reading between the two arms, or symptoms of poor circulation — all of these are unusual findings in a younger person.\nYour doctor may suspect that you have Takayasu's arteritis if you have at least three of the six criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology to distinguish it from other forms of vasculitis:\nOther criteria have been developed for research purposes but have not been well studied in clinical settings.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history, and examine you, paying special attention to your heart and blood vessels. He or she will measure the blood pressure in your arms and legs and check the strength of pulses in your extremities and neck. To check for bruits in narrowed vessels, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to specific areas of your chest, neck, and abdomen.\nAfter the physical examination, your doctor may order blood tests. Also, to identify areas where arteries are damaged, your doctor may request one or more of the following studies: standard angiography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), Doppler ultrasound, standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT).\nIn some cases, positron emission tomography (PET), in combination with CT (PET-CT) or MR (PET-MR), may be helpful. When surgery is performed (for example, to repair an aneurysm), the pathology specimen obtained during surgery can help secure the diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long Takayasu's arteritis lasts varies. In many cases, the active illness lasts for years, causing continuing inflammation and ongoing damage to blood vessels. If symptoms go away, either on their own or after treatment, they can return later. Damage to arteries may be permanent. Even when Takayasu's arteritis itself is no longer active, narrowed arteries may continue to disrupt blood flow to organs.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent Takayasu's arteritis.\n",
      "Treatment": "Doctors usually begin treatment for Takayasu's arteritis with glucocorticoid medications, such as prednisone. If these medications alone do not work well or if there is a high risk of steroid-related complications, another immunosuppressive drug, such as tocilizumab (Actemra), etanercept (Enbrel), or infliximab (Remicade), may be added. Other treatment options include methotrexate (Folex, Methotrexate, and Rheumatrex), azathioprine (Imuran), mycophenolate (CellCept), leflunomide (Arava), or cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar). Blood pressure medications also may be necessary to control high blood pressure.\nIf Takayasu's arteritis has caused significant narrowing of an artery, the narrowed segment may need to be widened or repaired. Depending on the artery affected, there are several ways this can be accomplished, including:\nInflamed segments of arteries may become weakened, leading to the formation of an aneurysm, or outpouching of the vessel. These may expand over time and rupture, a potentially life-threatening event; therefore, tests for aneurysm (including MRA) may be recommended for people with Takayasu's arteritis, and if an aneurysm is large or expanding, surgical repair may be recommended.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you develop any severe pain, coldness, or a blue discoloration in an arm or leg, chest pain, or symptoms of stroke.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Symptoms resolve in about 60% of people with Takayasu's arteritis when they are treated with glucocorticoids alone. However, symptoms return in about half of these patients. When symptoms return, retreatment with a combination of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs has a 40% to 80% success rate. But, it's common for symptoms to return again. Overall, about 80% survive at least 15 years following the diagnosis, but the prognosis varies depending on whether there are complications (such as the development of aneurysms). The prognosis may be improving due to newer treatment options.\n",

      "What is dacryocystitis?": "Dacryocystitis is an infection in the tear drainage system. Tears drain from each eye through small canals, a tear sac (lacrimal sac) and a tear duct (nasolacrimal duct).\nTears are made by a small organ above the eye under the upper lid. At the inner corner of each upper and lower eyelid is an opening to a small tube (drainage canal).  The drainage canals carry away tears that have rinsed the front surface of the eye away so fresh tears can come in.\nThe drainage canals empty into tear sacs, one for each eye. The tear sacs sit at the top of the tear duct. Tears move through the sac into the duct and then are dumped into your nose.\nTears spill out of the eyes and into the back of your nose when you cry, although the tears entering the nose are not visible. That's why you get a runny nose when you cry.\nThe tear drainage system can get infected if it becomes blocked and bacteria collect in the ducts or the lacrimal sac. A blockage near the nose also can cause excessive tearing from the eye.\n\nAlthough tear duct infections can occur at any age, they are most common in infants, who commonly have a congenital (inborn) obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. Infants with this problem have a narrower drainage passageway that will widen with time as they grow. Most children with the disorder outgrow it by the time they are 1 year old.\nIf adults get a tear duct infections, it usually is because their tear ducts have become abnormally narrowed by continued growth of surrounding bone. The ducts are more rigid and less able to flush out the debris that can cause blockages.\nTear ducts also can become blocked after trauma to the nose or eyes, such as a broken nose, or by nasal polyps.\nWhen a tear duct infection first occurs, it is called acute dacryocystitis. If a tear duct infection is not treated quickly or if it causes minor symptoms that build up over a long period, it can be more difficult to cure. The infection is then called chronic dacryocystitis.\n",
      "Symptoms of dacryocystitis": "Typical symptoms of acute tear duct infection include:\nSymptoms of chronic (long-lasting) tear duct blockage are less severe. Although there may be tearing and perhaps some pus or discharge, usually there is little or no pain, redness or swelling.\n",
      "Diagnosing dacryocystitis": "Your doctor will examine you for signs of swelling and redness at the corner of the eye, fever, excessive tearing and discharge of pus. Pressing on the lacrimal sac may cause mucus or pus to come out of the ducts near the eye. If pus is present, a sample of the discharge can be collected and tested to determine the type of bacteria causing the infection.\nIf the physical signs do not obviously show dacryocystitis, or if the doctor wants to confirm the diagnosis, he or she may do a dye disappearance test. With this test, a yellow fluorescent dye is placed in the corner of the eye and allowed to mix with the eye's film of tears. If the tear drainage system is functioning well, the dye should disappear from the eye's surface after several minutes. A cotton swab can be inserted into the nose to see if any dye has passed through the tear duct. This test can help your doctor tell whether your tear duct is blocked completely or partially.\n",
      "Expected duration of dacryocystitis": "In infants or adults, tear duct infections need to be treated when there is redness or fever and cloudy tear drainage. Acute tear duct infections usually will go away quickly with antibiotic therapy. Between episodes of acute infection, there may still be excessive tearing or cloudy drainage from block tear ducts. In infants, the obstruction that causes an infection is commonly outgrown by the age of 9 to 12 months. Chronic infections, especially in adults, can be difficult to cure without surgery to expand the tear duct's drainage channel.\n",
      "Preventing dacryocystitis": "If a child is prone to tear duct infections, here's a routine that helps decrease the frequency of infections. First, wash your hands thoroughly. Apply a warm compress (a warm, wet clean washcloth) over the area of the tear sac. Then, place your index finger sideways along the bony ridge beneath the child's eye, with your finger pointing toward the top of the nose. Firmly, but gently, apply pressure with your finger tip between the eye and nose. This pressure will compress and empty the tear sac, flushing the duct below. After this, rinse and re-warm the compress. Apply it again to the same area for one or two minutes.\n",
      "Treating dacryocystitis": "Antibiotics that can be taken by mouth are the standard treatment for tear duct infection. However, a severe infection requires initial intravenous antibiotics and observation in the hospital.\nIn general, antibiotics clear up acute infections quickly. Antibiotics are also used to treat chronic infections. In some cases, antibiotic ointment or eye drops may be prescribed. Do not attempt to apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment to the eye or the area around the eye, since over-the-counter ointments are not made for use in the eye and could have irritating ingredients.\nIf the infection does not respond to antibiotics, or if infections keep returning, minor surgery may be needed. There are several types of surgical treatments for tear duct infections:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call a health care professional if you or your child experiences any of the eye symptoms of an infection, including pain, excessive tearing, redness, swelling or pus.\n",
      "Prognosis": "There are treatments for just about any cause or severity of tear duct infection, so the outlook for this problem is good.\nMost children outgrow a problem with blocked tear ducts by the time they are 1 year old.\n",

      "What is telogen effluvium?": "At any given time, about 85% to 90% of the hairs on the average person's head are actively growing (the anagen phase) and the others are resting (the telogen phase). Typically, a hair is in the anagen phase for two to four years, then enters the telogen phase, rests for about two to four months, and then falls out and is replaced by a new, growing hair. The average person naturally loses about 100 hairs a day.\nIn a person with telogen effluvium, some body change or shock pushes more hairs into the telogen phase. Typically in this condition, about 30% of the hairs stop growing and go into the resting phase before falling out. So if you have telogen effluvium, you may lose an average of 300 hairs a day instead of 100.\nTelogen effluvium can be triggered by a number of different events, including:\nBecause hairs that enter the telogen phase rest in place for two to four months before falling out, you may not notice any hair loss until two to four months after the event that caused the problem. Telogen effluvium rarely lasts longer than six months, although some cases last longer.\nAlthough losing a great number of hairs within a short time can be frightening, the condition is usually temporary. Each hair that is pushed prematurely into the telogen phase is replaced by a new, growing hair, so there is no danger of complete baldness. Because hair on the scalp grows slowly, your hair may feel or look thinner than usual for a time, but fullness will return as the new hairs grow in.\n",
      "Symptoms of telogen effluvium": "If you have telogen effluvium, you'll notice more hair than usual accumulating on your pillowcase, on the shower or bathroom floor and in your hairbrush. Your scalp hair may feel or look less dense than usual. Often, though, the hair loss is subtle, and other people may not notice anything different about your hair.\n",
      "Diagnosing telogen effluvium": "Most cases of telogen effluvium can be diagnosed based on medical history and an examination of the scalp and hair. If the hair loss has been occurring for several months, there may be visible thinning patches, but often the hair loss is not dramatic enough for a doctor to notice. If you have large bald patches, you probably don't have telogen effluvium. If the doctor gently tugs on some hairs on your scalp and four or more hairs come out, you probably have telogen effluvium. Also, the hairs will look like hairs in the telogen phase — they will have a white bulb at the end that was in the scalp, and will not have a gel-like covering around that end of the hair.\nYou may be asked to gather all hairs that fall out of your head over a 24-hour period, and count them to see if the hair loss is truly excessive. Losing fewer than 100 hairs in a day is considered normal. You also may be asked to gather and count lost hairs every one or two weeks to see when the shedding starts to decline.\nIn some rare cases, if there is reason to doubt the diagnosis, a biopsy of the scalp may be done. In this procedure, a small piece of the scalp that includes several hair follicles is removed and examined under a microscope. Your doctor also may do blood tests to check for conditions such as thyroid abnormalities that may be contributing to hair loss.\n",
      "Expected duration of telogen effluvium": "Typically, hair loss begins two to four months after the event that triggered the problem, and lasts approximately six months. New hairs begin growing immediately after the hair falls out, but significant growth may not be noticed for several months.\n",
      "Preventing telogen effluvium": "Nothing can be done to prevent most of the types of physical shock that can start telogen effluvium. Some cases may be caused by a poor diet, and these might be prevented by eating a balanced diet that provides enough protein, iron and other nutrients.\n",
      "Treating telogen effluvium": "No treatment for active telogen effluvium has been proven effective.\nSome causes of the disorder can be corrected. For example, if you have a poor diet, consult a dietitian to help you balance it. If the hair loss began after you started a new medication, talk to your doctor to see if the medication should be discontinued. Many times, however, the cause is a specific event in the past, and you can expect that the hair will grow back. In cases where hair growth has not returned to a satisfactory level, your doctor may prescribe minoxidil (Rogaine), a lotion applied to the scalp that may stimulate hair growth in some people.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your doctor if you experience excessive hair loss or obvious thinning patches on your scalp.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for telogen effluvium is very good. Most cases run their course within six to nine months, and the hair usually grows back. In some cases, the disorder may last longer. In other cases, not all hairs grow back.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Tendons are tough, flexible, fibrous bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. When tendons become inflamed or irritated the condition is called tendonitis. Tendons can be small, like the delicate, tiny bands in the hands, or large, like the heavy, ropelike cords that anchor the calf or thigh muscles. In most cases, the cause of tendonitis is unknown; when a cause can be identified, the condition usually happens for one of two reasons:\nOther causes include rheumatoid arthritis and reactive arthritis which may cause tendon as well as joint inflammation. Rarely, tendonitis is caused by an infection, such as gonorrhea. Tendonitis is most common in the shoulder, elbow, knee, wrist and heel, although it can happen anywhere that tendons are found in the body. For uncertain reasons, tendonitis is also common in people with diabetes. In recent years, a rare cause of tendonitis (or other tendon disease, including rupture) has been recognized: the use of certain antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin. Why this happens is unknown.\nTendonitis in the shoulder– The most common form of tendonitis in the shoulder is rotator cuff tendonitis. It involves the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle, which attaches to the upper portion of the upper arm bone (humerus) at the shoulder joint. Less commonly, the tendon of the infraspinatus muscle or other tendons of the rotator cuff is affected. In most cases, the supraspinatus tendon is injured by overuse, typically in an occupation or sport that requires the arm to be elevated repeatedly. People at risk include carpenters, painters, welders, swimmers, tennis players and baseball players. The average patient is a male laborer older than 40, and the shoulder pain is on the same side as his dominant hand (for example, right shoulder pain in a right-handed person).\nTendonitis in the elbow– Two forms of tendonitis commonly involve the elbow: lateral epicondylitis and medial epicondylitis. Both are very common overuse injuries among athletes involved in golf or throwing and racquet sports.\nLateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow)causes pain on the outer side of the elbow joint. This condition probably affects 40% to 50% of all adult athletes who play racquet sports. It also can be caused by any activity that repeatedly twists and flexes the wrist, such as pulling weeds, using a screwdriver or even carrying a briefcase.\nMedial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow)causes pain on the inner side of the elbow. It is a less common injury than tennis elbow and, despite its name, it is more likely to be related an occupation that requires repeated elbow movements (such as construction work) than to sports. When it does occur as a sports injury, medial epicondylitis can be triggered by repeatedly swinging a golf club or throwing a baseball.\nTendonitis in the knee– Jumper's knee, the most common form of knee tendonitis, involves either the patellar tendon at the lower edge of the kneecap or the quadriceps tendon at the upper edge of the kneecap. It is a common overuse injury, especially in basketball players and distance runners.\nTendonitis in the wrist– In the wrist, tendonitis commonly appears in the form of de Quervain's disease, a condition that causes pain in the back of the wrist at the base of the thumb. Although de Quervain's disease usually occurs in people who repeatedly grasp or pinch with the thumb, it sometimes develops during pregnancy or for no known reason.\nAchilles tendonitis– This form of tendonitis affects the Achilles tendon, the large ropelike tendon attached to the heel bone at the back of the foot. Achilles tendonitis usually is caused by overuse, especially in sports that require running or repeated jumping, and it accounts for 15% of all running injuries. Achilles tendonitis also may be related to faulty running technique or to poorly fitting shoes, if the back of the shoe digs into the Achilles tendon above the heel. Less often, Achilles tendonitis is related to an inflammatory illness, such as ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, gout or rheumatoid arthritis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In general, tendonitis causes pain in the tissues surrounding a joint, especially after the joint is used too much during play or work. In some cases, the joint may feel weak, and the area may be red, swollen and warm to the touch.\nWhen tendonitis is caused by an infection such as gonorrhea, there may be other symptoms, including rash, fever, or a discharge from the vagina or penis.\nOther symptoms vary according to which tendon is affected:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "After reviewing your medical history, including any previous joint injuries, your doctor will ask you specific questions about your pain:\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will look for tenderness, swelling, redness, muscle weakness and limited motion in the area of the sore tendon. Your doctor also may ask you to move in certain ways, such as raising your arm above your head or bending your wrist. These moves may hurt, but they are very important to help your doctor figure out which tendon is affected. In most cases, the diagnosis can be made based on your medical history and symptoms, together with your occupational and sports history and the results of your physical examination.\nSome people may need blood tests to look for other causes of inflammation around the joints, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. X-rays also may be taken to confirm that there is no fracture, dislocation or bone disease. In people with Achilles tendonitis or rotator cuff tendonitis, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may be used to help evaluate the extent of tendon damage.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Depending on the location and severity of tendonitis, symptoms may last for a few days or for several weeks. If there is continued overuse or aggravation of the injured site, pain may worsen and persist for several months.\n",
      "Prevention": "In many cases, tendonitis can be avoided by taking a few simple precautions. Some helpful strategies include:\n",
      "Treatment": "The quicker your tendonitis is treated, the sooner you'll recover full strength and flexibility. Your doctor first may recommend that you apply ice packs to the painful area for 20-minute periods, three or four times a day. You also should ice the area immediately after any activity that aggravates your pain (such as tennis or running). To relieve pain and swelling, your doctor may suggest that you take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others), aspirin or another nonprescription anti-inflammatory medication, for up to several weeks. You also will need to rest the area for a few days to a few weeks to allow your body to repair itself. For example, people with golfer's elbow usually need to rest the affected elbow for at least one month. If an infection is causing the tendonitis, an antibiotic is recommended.\nDepending on the location and severity of tendonitis, you may need temporary splinting, bracing or a sling (for tendonitis in the upper extremity). However, it is important to gently and regularly move the joint to avoid getting a stiff, or \"frozen,\" joint.  This is particularly important for tendonitis involving the shoulder.\nWhen tendonitis is related to a condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or reactive arthritis, treatment of the underlying condition may improve the tendon inflammation and prevent recurrence.\nFor more serious cases of noninfectious tendonitis, your doctor may inject a corticosteroid drug or local anesthetic into the affected tendon. He or she also may refer you to a physical therapist for more specialized local treatments, such as deep heat treatments using ultrasound, friction massage or water therapy to improve joint mobility. The physical therapist also will guide you through a rehabilitation program that will help you to regain strength, motion and function. The length of time for rehabilitation varies depending on the type and severity of tendonitis. For example, Achilles tendonitis and epicondylitis may require several months to resolve.\nSurgery is rarely needed to treat tendonitis. It is reserved for cases that do not respond to other types of treatment or when there is significant tendon damage that is unlikely to improve with any other treatment.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have a significant joint problem, such as severe pain, redness or swelling or loss of joint function. Also, call your doctor if less-severe joint pain is persistent.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With proper treatment, the affected tendon usually recovers completely. However, incomplete rehabilitation or a hasty return to activity can slow the healing process or lead to re-injury.\n",

      "What is it?": "Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is inflammation of the fibrous tissue (tendon) that connects muscle to bone in the elbow. It is a form of tendonitis. In tennis elbow, the tendons on the outside of the elbow (the lateral epicondyle) are affected. In golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis), another form of tendonitis, the tendons on the inside of the elbow are affected. The inflamed tendons may be strained or have tiny tears caused by overusing the muscles that control the wrist and fingers.\n\n\n\nTennis elbow often results from playing tennis and other racquet sports, particularly if the participant is using improper form. However, it is caused more commonly by noncompetitive activities, such as pulling weeds, carrying a suitcase or using a screwdriver, that strain the tendons in the elbow. Sometimes, tennis elbow develops for no apparent reason.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Tennis elbow causes pain, tenderness and sometimes swelling of the elbow and forearm on the affected side. The pain may worsen if the person attempts any activity that stresses the painful tendons, such as lifting heavy objects or even just shaking hands.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, especially whether your elbow or forearm hurts when you move your wrist. Your doctor also will ask about any sports or physical activities that may have triggered your symptoms.\nDuring a physical examination, your doctor will check for pain, tenderness and swelling in the elbow, forearm and wrist on the affected side. If your symptoms are not characteristic of tennis elbow or if you have an unusual history of injury, your doctor may order X-rays or other tests to check for other possible problems. However, no tests are required to make the diagnosis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "The pain of tennis elbow generally subsides within a few weeks, although it sometimes can last for months. Continuing to use the injured muscles can prevent healing and may result in a long-lasting (chronic) condition.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you play racquet sports, use the proper equipment for your size and skill level. You may want to consult a professional to be sure you are using proper equipment and technique. You also can adjust the tension of the strings of your racquet. A sports medicine professional or physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles and increase flexibility to prevent future injury. Also, many specialists suggest using a forearm band placed one to two inches below the elbow to reduce tension on the tendons.\nDo not increase the frequency, duration or intensity of any sports activity rapidly. Start slowly, and build slowly. Try to maintain a neutral wrist position (not bent backward or forward). If you feel significant elbow or arm pain, stop immediately and review your symptoms with your doctor.\n",
      "Treatment": "The most important treatment for tennis elbow is rest, because the condition will not improve if the activity that caused it continues. Ice packs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn and others), may provide some relief from pain. A forearm band or strap wrapped around the forearm just below the elbow may provide significant relief. This rests the inflamed tendon. People with severe pain may have the elbow immobilized in a sling or splinted at a 90-degree angle, although the elbow should not be immobilized for prolonged periods.\nSome doctors also recommend an injection of a corticosteroid, such as cortisone, into the area to reduce inflammation and pain. Some patients need physical therapy, including ultrasound therapy and exercises to strengthen the area and increase flexibility. For tennis elbow that continues to cause significant discomfort, a number of other treatments may be recommended, including nitroglycerine patches, acupuncture, and botulinum toxin injections.  However, the overall effectiveness of these and other alternatives are uncertain.  As a last resort, surgery may be considered.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have pain and your ability to move your wrist or elbow motion has not improved within a week or two. Call even sooner if there is swelling, if the pain began after a significant injury, or if you are unable to use your wrist or elbow.\n",
      "Prognosis": "With proper treatment, symptoms of tennis elbow usually improve within a few weeks. However, in some patients, symptoms persist for several months. If tennis elbow is not properly treated, it can become a chronic condition with frequent flare-ups.\n",

      "What is it?": "Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. These headaches are not caused by disease. They are often considered to be \"normal\" headaches. Other names for tension headaches are ordinary headaches, muscle tension headaches, and stress headaches.\nThe International Headache Society has suggested that doctors use the term tension-type headaches because so many different names have been used for tension headaches. Typically tension-type headache causes mild to moderate pain, usually on both sides of the head. There is a pressing or tightening sensation. It is not pulsating and is not accompanied by nausea. The headache does not get worse with routine physical activity.\nThe society has defined different categories based upon how frequently tension-type headaches occur and how persistent they are:\nThe exact cause of tension headaches is unknown. But there appear to be several contributing factors.\nIn part, they result from changes in how the nerves of the head, neck and shoulders sense pain. They are also caused by changes in the brain's interpretation of the pain signals sent from the muscles in the head and neck. Emotional stress and muscular tension also probably act as triggers.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptom of a tension headache is a sense of tightness around the head. This is sometimes described as a \"tight hat-band\" or \"vise\" sensation.\nNeck and shoulder muscles are often tense and sore to the touch. The person may have trouble concentrating and difficulty sleeping.\nA person can have both migraine and tension-type headaches. And the symptoms of tension-type headaches and migraine headaches can overlap. For example, both types of headaches may be made worse by bright lights or loud noises. In general, migraine headaches tend to be throbbing. Tension-type headaches cause a more constant pain. But the pain of a migraine or tension-type headache can be steady or throbbing or alternate between the two.\n\n",
      "Diagnosis": "There is no specific test to confirm the diagnosis of a tension-type headache. The diagnosis is determined by your description of the headache, other medical history and a normal physical examination.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head may be ordered. These imaging tests may be used to investigate headache pain that is associated with unexpected or unusual symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration": "An episodic tension-type headache may last only 30 minutes. But it may linger for as long as seven days.\nA chronic tension-type headache typically lasts for part or all of the day for most days of the week. The pain can also be continuous. The intensity of pain may fluctuate during that time.\n",
      "Prevention": "Relaxation techniques and avoidance of stressful situations may help to prevent tension-type headaches. Many things can trigger a tension-type headache. Identifying and correcting one or more triggers may reduce headache frequency and severity.\n",
      "Treatment": "Infrequent episodic tension-type headaches.Over-the-counter pain relievers are convenient, effective and relatively safe. Examples include aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). Some people get more pain relief with combination products containing caffeine.\nThe use of any over-the-counter pain reliever should be limited to no more than two or three days per week. If pain medications are used more frequently, \"rebound\" headaches may occur on the days that medications are not taken.\nFrequent episodic and chronic tension-type headaches.These headaches are more difficult to treat. Rebound headaches are common when pain relievers are stopped. Therapy to prevent the headache before it starts is a better strategy than taking pain relievers after the headache is present. Your doctor may suggest a trial of one of the medications used to prevent frequent migraine attacks, such as a beta-blocker (metoprolol or propranolol) or an antidepressant (amitriptyline or venlafaxine).\nSome people are able to treat their tension-type headaches without medications. You can apply an ice compress, heating pad or massage to any tight areas in the neck and shoulders.\nRelaxation techniques and deep-breathing exercises may help to decrease the frequency and severity of headaches. Some people get relief with biofeedback or acupuncture.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Most headaches are harmless. It's reassuring if you are able to relieve your headache without medications or with only occasional use of a pain reliever.\nHeadaches are rarely caused by a serious medical problem. However, you should call or visit your doctor if you have:\n",
      "Prognosis": "Infrequent episodic tension-type headaches can usually be treated successfully with pain relieving medication. But finding the right combination of therapies to relieve frequent episodic and chronic tension-type headaches may take several months. Over time most people will have fewer and less severe headaches.\n",

      "What is testicular torsion?": "Torsion of the testicle is an uncommon but serious condition in which the testicle twists on the cord that provides its blood supply. The twisting of this cord cuts off the blood supply to the testicle. It is extremely painful and must be treated immediately to prevent permanent damage to the testicle. Testicular torsion can happen after strenuous exercise or an injury, but it also can occur without any apparent cause. The condition can occur at any age but is most common between the ages of 10 and 20.\n",
      "Symptoms of testicular torsion": "Sudden onset of severe pain and extreme tenderness in one testicle, with or without an obvious cause, is the most striking symptom. Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting associated with the pain, and swelling on one side of the scrotum.\n",
      "Diagnosing testicular torsion": "The diagnosis is based largely on the symptoms described above and a physical examination. The testicle may be raised high in the scrotum on the affected side. Your doctor will try to make sure the symptoms aren't caused by other conditions that affect the testicle and scrotum, including epididymitis (inflammation of the cord-like seminal duct, located behind the testicle) and orchitis (inflammation of the testicle itself, often caused by infection).\nUnder certain circumstances, a testicular cancer or tumor can present with symptoms similar to a testicular torsion. This occurs because there may be some bleeding into a testis cancer that can cause the same type of pain and swelling as a torsion of the testis. An ultrasound test to examine the contents of the scrotum may help sort out the cause. Some institutions will also perform a testicular scan which can sometimes be helpful in distinguishing one cause from another. Sometimes, surgery is necessary to make a definite diagnosis. It's important for the condition to be diagnosed rapidly to ensure the best outcome.\n",
      "Expected duration of testicular torsion": "Occasionally, the testicle may untwist on its own, causing immediate relief from the swelling and pain. There are some occasions when the patient can untwist the testis itself, but usually immediate medical attention is essential. Do not wait for the testicle to untwist on its own. Testicular torsion must be treated within a few hours to prevent permanent damage.\n",
      "Preventing testicular torsion": "Most cases of testicular torsion cannot be prevented. However, there are boys who may comment that they are able to \"spin\" their testis around in the scrotum and then spin it back into its normal position. If this occurs, it may be very helpful for the person to seek the advice of a urologist. The urologist may suggest a procedure called an orchiopexy, an operation that surgically sews the bottom of the testicle to the wall of the scrotal sac (the sac that holds the testicles) to prevent the subsequent development of a torsion.\n",
      "Treating testicular torsion": "This condition is a surgical emergency. Sometimes, a urologist (a doctor who specializes in illnesses of the urinary tract and male reproductive organs) will attempt to untwist the testicle by hand. If this is not successful, immediate surgery is needed to save the testicle.\nAn incision is made in the scrotum so that the cord can be untwisted and the testicle anchored in place with a couple of stitches that attach the outside lining of the testis to the scrotal wall. This procedure is called an orchiopexy. If the testicle has been damaged by an absence of blood flow, it may have to be removed. The unaffected testicle also may be anchored during surgery to prevent it from twisting in the future.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Most people with testicular torsion will need to be evaluated in an emergency room. Seek medical attention for severe pain on one side of the scrotum that persists for more than a few minutes, especially if it is associated with swelling, nausea and vomiting. Again, it is very important that a correct diagnosis be established, especially to eliminate the possibility of testicular cancer.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The testicle will usually recover quickly and completely if the condition is corrected immediately. If the blood supply to the testicle is cut off for a prolonged period, the testicle may need to be removed surgically. Most men who have had testicular torsion will have normal fertility and sexual function.\n",

      "What is tetanus?": "Tetanus, also called lockjaw, is a life-threatening infection caused byClostridium tetanibacteria. Although these bacteria are especially common in the soil and manure of farms, they can be found almost anywhere. They live in the dirt of suburban gardens and in the dirty waters of floods. They also contaminate dust in cities.\nTetanus bacteria usually enter the body through a dirty puncture wound, cut, scrape, or some other break in the skin. Once inside the skin, they multiply and produce a toxin, or poison, that affects the body's nerves. This toxin causes severe muscle spasms, cramps, and seizures. Spasms in the jaw muscles produce lockjaw. Spasms also occur in muscles of the throat, chest, abdomen, and extremities. If you don't receive proper treatment, the toxin's effect on respiratory muscles can interfere with breathing. If this happens, you may die of suffocation.\nA tetanus infection may develop after almost any type of skin injury, major or minor. This includes cuts, punctures, crush injuries, burns, and animal bites. In rare cases, a tetanus infection also can occur after surgery, an ear infection, a dental infection, or an abortion. Tetanus infections have followed heroin injections, especially if the heroin was mixed with quinine. Tetanus also can develop after body piercing, tattooing, an insect sting, or even a tiny splinter.\nIn the United States, only about 30 cases of tetanus occur each year because so many Americans have been immunized against the infection. Almost everyone who develops tetanus in the United States has been inadequately immunized against tetanus. Some have immigrated from developing countries where vaccines are not available to everyone. Others were born in the United States but never received the primary series of injections. Still others simply failed to keep up with the normal schedule of tetanus shots, especially among adults older than 60.\n",
      "Symptoms of tetanus": "On average, symptoms of tetanus begin seven to eight days after tetanus bacteria enter the body. These symptoms may include:\n",
      "Diagnosing tetanus": "There is no laboratory test for tetanus. A doctor will diagnose tetanus based on your symptoms, a history of a recent cut or puncture wound, and immunization history.\n",
      "Expected duration of tetanus": "People who have tetanus must be treated in a hospital. Severe muscle spasms may last for about three to four weeks and then slowly get better. Once these spasms subside, recovery takes several months.\n",
      "Preventing tetanus": "Immunization can prevent almost all cases of tetanus.\nIn the United States, babies are immunized against tetanus through a series of four vaccinations. This primary series is given in the form of DTaP shots. In addition to the vaccine for tetanus, each DTaP shot contains vaccines against diphtheria, which is a severe respiratory infection, and pertussis, also called whooping cough. The usual schedule for DTaP shots is as follows:\nOnce the primary series of tetanus immunizations is complete, a child usually receives two tetanus booster shots. One is given between the ages of 4 and 6 years, just before the child starts school. The second is given between the ages of 11 and 12 years. Booster shots enhance (boost) a child's level of tetanus immunity.\nAfter age 12, a tetanus booster shot usually is recommended every 10 years. Under special circumstances, however, a doctor may give the booster dose sooner. For example, a tetanus booster is usually given if you get a severe cut or puncture wound and it has been more than five years since your last tetanus shot. This is because some people show a decrease in tetanus immunity within five to 10 years after the last tetanus booster.\nIn adults and children older than 7 who have never been immunized against tetanus, doctors use a primary series of Td shots. Once the primary Td series is finished, booster shots are usually given every 10 years. Because of the recent increase in pertussis cases, at least one of the shots should be a DTaP during adulthood.\nAll adults and children should receive routine tetanus immunizations. However, certain groups of people must be especially careful to keep their tetanus shots up to date. These people have jobs or hobbies that expose them to dirt, dust, manure, or dirty water. Some examples include farm workers, landscapers, gardeners, firefighters, and people who are exposed to sewage or flood water. Veterinary workers and people who deal with animal waste are also at high risk.\nDoctors review a patient's tetanus immunizations before surgery and before childbirth. All women of childbearing age should be immunized against tetanus. Newborns rely on their mother's tetanus immunity to protect them from tetanus until their own DTaP shots begin. An infant who is not properly protected against tetanus can develop a tetanus infection even from having his or her umbilical cord cut.\nAny wound should be cleaned well as soon as possible, especially if it is contaminated with dirt, to reduce the risk of infection with the bacteria that cause tetanus.\n",
      "Treating tetanus": "If you seek medical care for a wound, your doctor will ask you when you had your last tetanus shot. If your tetanus immunization is not up to date, the doctor will give you a tetanus booster. However, this booster shot will not produce immunity right away, so with certain high-risk wounds (such as a deep wound contaminated by soil) you may receive tetanus immune globulin as well. Tetanus immune globulin contains an antitoxin that neutralizes the tetanus toxin, temporarily protecting you until your immune system responds to the tetanus booster.\nIf you have full-blown tetanus, you will be treated in a hospital. There you will receive tetanus immune globulin to neutralize the tetanus toxin. Your muscle spasms will be treated with muscle relaxants, and you also may be sedated. If necessary, you will be placed on a ventilator to help you breathe. Wound care, including antibiotics and removal of dead or infected tissue, is essential. You will begin a schedule of shots to restore your tetanus immunity, because a tetanus infection does not make you immune to the disease.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms of tetanus. Also, seek medical care immediately for any deep cut, serious puncture wound, or any wound contaminated by dirt or manure.\nIf you are an adult, check your immunization records for the date of your last tetanus shot. If it has been more than 10 years since your last tetanus booster, schedule an appointment to receive a booster. Contact your doctor if your health records show that you never received a full primary series of tetanus immunizations.\nIf you are a parent, be sure your child's immunizations are all up to date. This is especially true for DTaP shots and other vaccines that are given in a series.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most patients with tetanus survive and return to previous function. However, the prognosis depends on vaccination status, how soon treatment is started, and disease severity. Older adults, young children, and those who have a rapid progression from time of infection to severe symptoms have a higher risk of death. In recent years, about 10% of people with tetanus in the US have died of the disease.\n",

      "What is throat cancer?": "Throat cancer occurs when cells in the organs used for breathing, speaking, and swallowing begin to divide rapidly and abnormally. Most throat cancer begins on the vocal cords. Later, it spreads to the voice box (larynx); to the back of the throat, including part of the tongue and the tonsils (this whole area is called the pharynx); or below the voice box to the subglottis and trachea (windpipe). An early symptom of throat cancer is unexplained hoarseness or a raspy voice.\nSmokers are at high risk of throat cancer. Other people at risk include those who drink a lot of alcohol, especially if they also smoke. People with a vitamin A deficiency and certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection also may be more likely to develop throat cancer.\nThroat cancer is associated with other cancers. Fifteen percent of throat cancer patients also are diagnosed at the same time with cancer of the mouth, esophagus, or lung. Another 10% to 20% of people with throat cancer develop these other cancers later on.\nThroat cancer is more common among men, probably because smoking is more common among men. This type of cancer is less common among people under age 55. Many throat cancers can be treated successfully, but the treatment may affect the person's ability to speak.\n",
      "Symptoms of throat cancer": "When throat cancer affects your vocal cords, the first symptom is a change in the sound of your voice, especially a persistent rasp or hoarseness. Other symptoms of throat cancer include:\n",
      "Diagnosing throat cancer": "If your doctor suspects you have throat cancer, he or she will examine your throat. This can be done with a long-handled mirror or with a lighted tube called a laryngoscope. A local anesthetic might be used to ease discomfort. If abnormalities are found, your doctor will do a biopsy, which involves removing tissue for examination in a laboratory under a microscope. Throat cancer can only be confirmed through a biopsy.\nYour doctor will likely also send you for an imaging test, either a computed tomography (CT) scan or MRI. These tests provide images of the body from different angles, producing a cross-sectional view. They can help to find the location of a tumor, help to judge whether a tumor can be removed surgically and help to determine the cancer's stage of development.\nDoctors describe cancer using numerical stages. For example, a stage 0 or stage I tumor has not invaded very far into surrounding tissues, while a stage III or IV tumor may be penetrating throughout and beyond surrounding tissues.\nPET scanning may be done to evaluate cancer spread beyond the throat. The test helps to evaluate whether lymph nodes in the neck have cancer and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. It is proving to be very helpful in treatment planning and in long-term follow-up care.\n",
      "Expected duration of throat cancer": "Without treatment, throat cancer will continue to grow.\n",
      "Preventing throat cancer": "Because most risk factors are environmental rather than genetic, throat cancer can be prevented. Two keys to preventing throat cancer are:\n",
      "Treating throat cancer": "The type of treatment recommended depends largely on how far the cancer has spread at the time treatment begins. The preferred treatments for the early stages of throat cancer are radiation therapy and surgery. In more advanced cases, chemotherapy may be given in combination with surgery and/or radiation. When throat cancer already has spread widely throughout the body, chemotherapy may be given alone. Under these circumstances, surgery or radiation is unlikely to provide additional benefit, and it's unlikely the cancer can be cured.\nHere is treatment information broken down by cancer stage:\nMost cancers at later stages require the surgical removal of part or all of the larynx or pharynx. Surgical removal of the larynx is called laryngectomy. Surgical removal of part or all of the pharynx is called pharyngectomy. A laryngectomy is the most common surgery for throat cancer. Even if only part of the larynx is removed, the patient will lose some speaking ability and will require special techniques or reconstructive procedures to regain the use of his or her voice.\nA laryngectomy is the most common surgery for throat cancer. Even if only part of the larynx is removed, the patient will lose some of his or her ability to speak. He or she will need to learn special techniques or have reconstructive procedures to regain the use of his or her voice. Many centers now perform pharyngectomy robotic surgery. Complex operations that took hours and were quite debilitating can now be performed with greater efficiency using robotic assisted techniques.\nAfter treatment for throat cancer, some people will learn new ways to speak with voice aids, breathing techniques, and surgical restructuring. Because the pharynx is a passage to the digestive tract, patients undergoing pharyngectomy might need surgery to reconstruct the pharynx to allow food to pass through. If cancer cells have spread beyond the larynx or pharynx and into the lymph nodes, a surgery called neck dissection is required. In this surgery, lymph nodes thought to contain cancer cells are removed. This can help contain the cancer before it spreads throughout the body. After surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy may be done to destroy remaining cancer cells.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See a doctor if any symptoms of throat cancer, such as hoarseness, continue for more than two weeks. You may be referred to a specialist, called an ear, nose, and throat doctor (otolaryngologist), who deals mainly with disorders of the larynx and pharynx.\n",
      "Prognosis": "As with most cancers, the outlook is much better if throat cancer is found before it spreads. Although patients with earlier stages of throat cancer can be cured with surgery or radiation therapy, many have to learn new ways to speak. Also, throat cancer patients are at risk of developing other cancers in the mouth, throat, or esophagus. That's why follow-up examinations are crucial.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Thrombocytopenia is an abnormally low level of platelets in the blood.\nPlatelets are made by the bone marrow. They help your blood to clot. People with thrombocytopenia can have excessive bleeding.\nThis condition can occur in varying degrees. The risk of bleeding increases as the platelet count decreases.\nThrombocytopenia can occur alone. Or, it can develop as a complication of another disease, such as cancer or a viral infection. In some cases, it is a chronic (long-lasting) condition that persists for years. In other cases, it develops suddenly and dramatically.\nIn general, thrombocytopenia develops for one or more of the following reasons:\n",
      "Symptoms": "People with severe thrombocytopenia may have abnormal bleeding almost anywhere in the body.\nSymptoms can include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will begin by asking you about your medical history. He or she will ask about:\nYour doctor will examine you for specific signs of abnormal bleeding. These include bruises or blood spots in your skin. He or she also will feel your abdomen to determine whether your spleen is enlarged. The doctor will look for any signs of liver disease.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will order a blood test. The blood test will measure the number of platelets in your blood. Additional blood tests will be ordered at the same time to help diagnose why you have thrombocytopenia.\nIf your doctor thinks you may be having a reaction to a drug, he or she may ask you to stop taking the medication. The doctor will then see if your platelet count rises. If that happens, you have drug-induced thrombocytopenia.\nYour doctor may recommend a bone marrow biopsy. In this procedure, a long needle is used to remove a small piece of bone marrow. The marrow is examined in a laboratory. The appearance of your bone marrow and platelet-producing cells help to determine what is causing your problem.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "How long thrombocytopenia lasts depends on its cause.\nFor example, some patients with chronic ITP experience years of easy bruising and abnormally heavy vaginal bleeding. They may have repeated episodes of more severe bleeding.\nMost children with acute ITP recover within four to six weeks.\nSome people have such mild disease that they almost never have noticeable bleeding problems.\nMany people with drug-induced thrombocytopenia recover within 7 to 10 days after they stop taking the medication.\n",
      "Prevention": "Many cases of thrombocytopenia cannot be prevented.\nYou can avoid drinking large amounts of alcohol to lower your risk of developing alcohol-related thrombocytopenia.\nIf you already have had one episode of drug-induced thrombocytopenia, the problem is likely to return if you take the same medication again. To help prevent this, record the name of the specific medication that caused the problem. Tell every health care professional that you visit about your sensitivity to this drug.\nIf your doctor has determined that you are at risk of developing this condition, he or she may tell you not to take aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. That is because these medicines impair platelet function.\n",
      "Treatment": "How thrombocytopenia is treated depends on its cause and severity.\nIf your thrombocytopenia is mild and is not causing any significant bleeding, you may not need treatment. This is often the standard strategy in children with acute ITP.\nIf your thrombocytopenia is drug induced, your physician may change your prescription. Most people recover without additional treatment after they stop taking the medication.\nPatients with very low platelet counts and/or significant bleeding will need more aggressive treatment. Options for treatment include:\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "Call your doctor if you develop any of the symptoms of thrombocytopenia. Be sure to call if you notice abnormal bruises or if you experience significant bleeding from your nose, mouth, vagina, rectum or urinary tract.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The overall outlook is generally good. This is especially true if the cause can be identified and removed. Long-term management of the condition is often successful.\n",

      "What is a deep venous thrmobosis?": "A deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot (thrombus) that forms inside deep veins in your legs or pelvis. The clot blocks blood flow and causes pressure to build up in the vein. Part of the clot can break away and move through your bloodstream to your lungs. If the clot blocks one or more of the blood vessels in your lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolism.\nDVT is a common problem. Most of these clots occur when blood flow in the veins of the legs is slowed.\nOrdinarily, as you walk around, your leg muscles squeeze your veins and keep blood flowing back to the heart. But if you don't move your legs for many hours, blood flow in the veins of your legs may slow so much that clots form. Long periods of inactivity can occur during a long airplane flight or while recovering from an operation or stroke, for example.\nCertain people are more likely to get blood clots. These include:\nAnyone who develops DVT is at risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.\nA pulmonary embolism can lead to a sudden and sometimes very dramatic decrease in blood flow through the lungs. The decrease in blood flow can reduce the amount of blood flowing to your heart and the rest of your body. This can cause a drop in blood pressure and lead to fainting spells and even sudden death.\nThe blood flow decreases in part because the blood clot blocks blood flow. In addition, the blockage damages the walls of the lung's blood vessels. The damage releases chemicals that cause blood vessels to narrow.\n",
      "Symptoms of DVT": "Some blood clots in the leg veins do not cause any symptoms. However, when the blood clots involve larger veins, they generally cause:\nYou can check for edema by pressing your finger into your lower leg. If you have edema, the pressure from your finger will create a small dent in your lower leg for several seconds.\nA pulmonary embolism may cause no symptoms, mild symptoms, or serious symptoms that indicate a life-threatening emergency. Symptoms tend to be more severe when the blood clot is larger.\nSymptoms with a larger clot include sudden shortness of breath and chest pain. The pain tends to be knife-like. It often is worse when you take deep breaths.\nIf the pulmonary embolism is very large, symptoms may be more dramatic. They may include fainting spells, severe shortness of breath, and coughing up blood. A large pulmonary embolus can cause sudden death.\n",
      "Diagnosing DVT": "To diagnose DVT, your doctor will examine your legs to check for swelling and tenderness. He or she will ask about your symptoms and risk factors.\nBased on the findings, your doctor may order a D-Dimer blood test or an ultrasound of your legs.\nThe blood test measures the level of a chemical called D-Dimer. It is almost always abnormally high when blood clots are actively forming in the body.\nAn ultrasound of your legs is done to look for blood flow problems in your veins. This procedure is called a lower extremity non-invasive test, or LENI. If the LENI shows evidence of a blood clot, your doctor will diagnose DVT.\nIf the initial LENI is negative, it does not mean that there is no clot. It may be too early to see the full effect of the clot. Your doctor may ask that you return in three to four days for a repeat LENI.\nIf your doctor suspects you have a pulmonary embolism, he or she will first try to determine if you have DVT. If the LENI shows one or more blood clots in your leg veins, and you have symptoms of a pulmonary embolism, an embolism is the most likely diagnosis.\nOr your doctor may order computed tomography (CT) of the chest. The test requires an IV injection of dye to look for blood clots in the pulmonary arteries. People that have impaired kidney function or an allergy to the dye might need a different type of lung scan called a V/Q scan to examine lung blood flow.\n",
      "Expected duration of DVT": "If you have a DVT or pulmonary embolism, your symptoms should improve within a few days after starting treatment with blood-thinning medication. You will need to take medication for at least three to six months to prevent more blood clots from forming.\nMost people recover completely. But some people who had a very large pulmonary embolism or who already had lung disease will continue to have lung problems.\nSome people who have had a DVT develop a long-term problem with swelling of their legs. This is called post-phlebitic syndrome. These people often need to wear special stockings that help squeeze blood back toward the heart.\n",
      "Preventing DVT": "Most DVTs and pulmonary embolisms develop in people who are inactive because of an injury or surgery.\nIf you have had a DVT or pulmonary embolism, or you have a family history of blood-clotting problems, you can help prevent blood clots. Do the following:\n",
      "Treating DVT": "The initial treatment for a DVT or pulmonary embolism is heparin or one of the direct oral anticoagulant drugs, referred to as DOACs. These medications act on certain blood proteins to prevent new blood clot formation and therefore help unwanted clots get smaller. They are commonly called blood thinners.\nThere are two main types of heparin. The oldest type of heparin is best administered by a constant intravenous infusion. Another type of heparin is called low-molecular-weight heparin. It is injected under the skin once or twice per day.\nSome of the direct oral anticoagulant drugs are approved for initial treatment of DVT and pulmonary embolism. Examples include rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis).\nIf you have a DVT without a pulmonary embolism, you may not need to be hospitalized. You could be treated at home with injections of a low-molecular-weight heparin or either rivaroxaban or apixaban.\nIf you have a pulmonary embolism, you will probably be hospitalized, at least for a day or two. If so, you likely will be treated with either type of heparin initially. But oral rivaroxaban or apixaban could be an option instead of heparin if your pulmonary embolism is small.\nIf you are started on either IV heparin or low-molecular weight heparin shots under the skin, your doctor will transition you to an oral drug. Traditional oral therapy has been warfarin (Coumadin). For decades, it was the only oral drug to treat DVT and pulmonary embolism.\nToday, in addition to rivaroxaban and apixaban, two other direct oral anticoagulants can be used after heparin. They are dabigatran (Pradaxa) and edoxaban (Savaysa).\nWarfarin takes a few days to start working. Once a blood test shows that warfarin is effective, you will stop taking heparin. You will continue taking warfarin for several months or longer.\nDuring the first few weeks that you take warfarin, you will continue to need frequent blood tests to make sure you are taking the right amount. Once your blood test results consistently show that you are taking the right amount of medication, blood can be drawn every two to four weeks.\nSome foods — especially green, leafy vegetables that contain large amounts of vitamin K — can alter the blood-thinning action of warfarin. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these foods. You can continue to eat these foods as long as you eat approximately the same amount of them each day. That way, the effect on your medication will be consistent.\nOther medications can also affect how warfarin works in your body. Tell any doctor who is prescribing medications for you that you are taking warfarin.\nThe direct oral anticoagulants don't require regular blood testing. They are given in a fixed dose. The other advantage is not worrying about eating food with too much vitamin K.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor or go to a hospital emergency room immediately if you develop shortness of breath or sharp chest pain.\nCall your doctor if you have new unexplained onset of swelling and pain in one leg.\nEven if you are scheduled for a repeat LENI test in three or four days, call your doctor sooner if your leg swelling worsens.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Without treatment, a pulmonary embolism can be deadly. With appropriate and timely treatment, the outlook is very good.\nOnce you develop a DVT or pulmonary embolism, you are usually more likely to develop a second blood clot. This is because the original blood clot damages some of your leg veins. Now, your blood does not move as quickly or smoothly through these veins. This increases your risk of a new blood clot.\nHowever, if there is a clear reason that the blood clot formed, such as a long bed rest after surgery or an injury that damaged your blood vessels, your risk of developing more blood clots is relatively low unless you are forced to be inactive again or have another injury.\n",

      "What Is It?": "In a thrombotic stroke, a blood clot (thrombus) forms inside one of the brain's arteries. The clot blocks blood flow to a part of the brain. This causes brain cells in that area to stop functioning and die quickly.\nThe blood clot that triggers a thrombotic stroke usually forms inside an artery that already has been narrowed by atherosclerosis. This is a condition in which fatty deposits (plaques) build up inside blood vessels.\nThrombotic strokes can affect large or small arteries in the brain. Strokes that affect large arteries block flow to greater portions of the brain. These strokes tend to cause the most disability.\nWhen a thrombotic stroke occurs in a small artery, the artery is usually one that is deep within the brain. This stroke is more specifically named a lacunar stroke. Lacunar strokes often have minimal symptoms because only a small part of the brain is affected.\nAnother type of stroke — embolic stroke — is also caused by a blood clot. However, in an embolic stroke, the blood clot forms somewhere else in the body. It then travels through the bloodstream to the brain artery. The blood clot usually comes from the heart.\nAt first, it can be impossible for a doctor to determine which type of stroke a person is having. That is because the symptoms can be identical.\nA much less common cause of thrombotic stroke is migraine headache. In especially severe cases, a migraine headache can cause a brain artery to go into spasm for a long time. This can allow a blood clot to form.\nAbout half to two-thirds of all strokes are thrombotic strokes. The factors that increase your risk of having a thrombotic stroke are:\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of a thrombotic stroke vary, depending on which area of the brain is affected. That is because different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions. For example, different areas of the brain control movement, sight, speech, balance and coordination.\nSymptoms can include:\nIf any of these symptoms appear suddenly, you may be having a thrombotic stroke or any other kind of stroke. Symptoms, once they begin, can quickly become less prominent, stay the same or gradually get worse over hours or days.\nOften, brief episodes of stroke-like symptoms occur before a stroke. A short episode of stroke-like symptoms is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Symptoms appear suddenly and then get better over several minutes to a couple hours.  Most TIAs last less than 30 minutes. One or more of these attacks occurs before more than half of all strokes.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "To diagnose a stroke, your doctor will need an image of your brain. Two different brain imaging tests can be useful. They are a computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Usually the CT scan is done first because it can be obtained more quickly than an MRI.\nIf the CT scan shows bleeding in or around the brain, then you have had a hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke is treated differently than a stroke caused by a blood clot.\nIf the CT scan does not show any bleeding, then the stroke is presumed to be caused by a blocked artery from a blood clot. This is known as an ischemic stroke. An ischemic stroke can be either thrombotic or embolic.\nWhen available, an MRI is performed to confirm brain injury changes consistent with a new ischemic stroke.\nYour doctor will want to know exactly when the symptoms started. If the symptoms started within the last few hours, your doctor will determine whether you are a candidate to receive a clot-busting drug, such as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). This therapy is only used in people with ischemic strokes and symptoms that started only a few hours earlier.\nYour doctor also will try to determine whether the stroke is thrombotic or embolic. This is an important distinction because therapy for a thrombotic stroke is different from an embolic stroke.\nYour doctor will examine you. He or she will check your pulse and blood pressure, do a neurological exam, and examine your heart and neck arteries.\nIn addition to imaging of the brain, your doctor will order blood tests and an electrocardiogram (EKG). If the EKG shows an abnormal heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation, this suggests that the stroke could be embolic.\nOther tests may include:\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Recovery depends on how long blood flow to the brain is blocked.\nIf blood circulation in the brain is restored within minutes to a few hours, the person can recover rapidly, within hours to a day. For a small thrombotic stroke (lacunar stroke), symptoms often improve within a few days, even if the blood clot has not dissolved.\nWhen the blood supply is interrupted for longer periods of time, brain injury can be more severe. Symptoms may last for many months. Physical rehabilitation may be necessary.\nIn some cases, permanent brain damage causes permanent disability.\n",
      "Prevention": "If you have had one stroke, you have a high risk of having another.\nYou can help to prevent thrombotic strokes. You and your doctor should carefully manage the factors that put you at risk of atherosclerosis.\nRisk factors for atherosclerosis include:\nYou should have your cholesterol checked every five years, even if you have never had high cholesterol.\nOther things you can do to prevent stroke are to avoid drinking too much alcohol and never take cocaine or amphetamines.\nTalk with your doctor about whether you should take aspirin every day. Aspirin (in doses as low as 80 milligrams per day) can reduce the risk of thrombotic stroke.\nOther medications that prevent clots also can help. These stronger medicines are sometimes recommended to people who have already experienced a stroke. They help to prevent an additional stroke event. These drugs include dipyridamole (usually as a drug combined with aspirin called Aggrenox) and clopidogrel (Plavix).\nIf you have complex migraine with major neurological symptoms that happen during an attack, your doctor may advise not using certain medicines, such as triptans. This class of medicines includes sumatriptan (Imitrex), rizatriptan (Maxalt) and others. Taking these medications when you have neurologic symptoms may increase your risk of stroke.\n",
      "Treatment": "The most effective treatment for ischemic stroke is a clot-busting drug, such as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The drug must be given within several hours after stroke symptoms begin. For this reason, it is important to seek emergency treatment immediately if you have symptoms of a stroke. Do not wait to see if the symptoms go away on their own.\nClot-busters are administered through an intravenous line (IV) into a vein. This medicine can dissolve clots and restore blood flow in the brain. On average, patients who receive this medication have less long-term disability following a stroke.\nAn alternative to treatment with a clot-busting drug is catheter removal of the clot with a special device. To be effective, the procedure must be performed within several hours of symptom onset.\nLater, another type of medication, such as heparin, is given. Heparin prevents existing blood clots from getting bigger. And it prevents new clots from forming.\nLonger term, treatment depends upon whether the stroke was thrombotic or embolic. For a thrombotic stroke, doctors prescribe an anti-platelet agent. These include:\nFor an embolic stroke caused by a clot that formed in the heart and travelled to the brain, doctors prescribe an oral anti-coagulant drug. In the past, they almost always prescribed warfarin (Coumadin). Now there are new direct oral anti-coagulants available, such as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.\nA person who has had a significant stroke should be hospitalized so he or she can be observed in case symptoms get worse. A person who has had a severe stroke may need a mechanical ventilator to help with breathing. A stroke patient also may need help with self-care or feeding.\nIn the hospital, a person who has had a stroke can meet with occupational and physical therapists. These therapists can help the person learn to work around a new disability and to regain strength. Often, a person will move from the hospital to a rehabilitation center to get intensive therapy before returning home.\n",
      "When To Call A Professional": "If you or someone you are with develops any of the symptoms of stroke, call your medical emergency hot line (911 in the United States). Transport to an emergency department needs to occur right away. It is important to have an evaluation even if your symptoms last only a few minutes. A TIA can be a warning sign that you are going to have a stroke soon.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If the brain's blood supply is restored quickly and completely, it is possible to recover from a stroke with little or no disability. People with symptoms that start to resolve quickly after the onset of a stroke have an excellent prognosis. The prognosis for recovery is less favorable when stroke symptoms become more prominent over the first 24 to 48 hours.\n",

      "What is thyroid cancer?": "Thyroid cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly. It is located under the Adam's apple in the front of the neck. Most cases of thyroid cancer can be cured.\nOne of the functions of the thyroid gland is to make thyroid hormone, which requires iodine. The gland collects iodine from foods, concentrates it, and produces thyroid hormone. Doctors often exploit this important function when treating thyroid cancer.\nThyroid hormone helps regulate the body's metabolism and energy level. An overactive thyroid can lead to hyperactivity, the \"jitters,\" and an irregular heart rhythm; an underactive thyroid can lead to fatigue and sluggishness. Cancer can affect the thyroid and cause these changes.\nNestled against the thyroid gland are four very small glands called parathyroid glands. They play a role in regulating the body's use of calcium. The nerve that controls the voice box is also very close to the thyroid. If you need a thyroid operation, your surgeon needs to identify and avoid damaging these structures. If the voice box nerve is damaged, for example, your voice may sound hoarse permanently.\nThe thyroid has two types of cells. They produce hormones that help regulate body functions:\nThere are five types of thyroid cancers:\nRarely, tumors arising from connective tissue (sarcomas) and lymph nodes (lymphomas) can start in the thyroid gland. They are treated differently than other thyroid cancers.\nAlthough scientists have not identified the exact cause of thyroid cancer, some studies have shown that people exposed to nuclear fallout or nuclear power plant accidents have a higher risk of developing thyroid cancer. In part, this is due to the presence of radioactive iodine. Because the thyroid has an attraction for iodine, the thyroid tissue accumulates this radioactive substance. Over time, it may cause cancer.\nOthers who have a higher risk of thyroid cancer include people who:\nIndividuals who have received radiation therapy to the chest (to treat Hodgkin's disease, for example) have an increased incidence of thyroid abnormalities, including cancer. This is even more likely if the thyroid was included in the radiation field. Such people will need lifelong follow up to assess thyroid function and check for cancer.\nSome forms of thyroid cancer are inherited. These occur alone (inherited MTC) or as part of a familial cancer syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2. Patients with MEN-2 develop tumors in other parts of the body such as the adrenal gland and peripheral nervous system.\nSome forms of thyroid cancer may be caused by genetic changes (mutations) that occur after birth.\nThyroid cancer is uncommon, accounting for only a small percentage of all cancers. However, it does strike more women than men.\n",
      "Symptoms of thyroid cancer": "Usually, a lump in the neck is the only symptom of thyroid cancer. When other symptoms occur, they may include\nOften, a patient has no symptoms; the disease is diagnosed based on a test performed for another reason.\nHaving some of these symptoms does not mean you have thyroid cancer. Symptoms can be caused by other conditions. If you have symptoms, see your doctor so that the problem can be diagnosed and treated.\n",
      "Diagnosing thyroid cancer": "Your doctor will examine you, feeling your neck to evaluate the size and firmness of the thyroid and to check for lumps and enlarged lymph nodes. Your doctor also may order the following tests and procedures:\nCT scans have become a common way to assess many medical conditions. Because the neck is imaged as part of an abdominal scan, thyroid cancer may be detected even though the test was done for another reason.\n",
      "Expected duration of thyroid cancer": "Thyroid cancer can develop slowly, remaining undetected for years. Like other cancers, it will continue to grow until treated.\n",
      "Preventing thyroid cancer": "Many people have no risk factors for thyroid cancer but develop it anyway. That's why this cancer usually can't be prevented.\nHowever, genetic blood tests can be used to identify people who have a high risk of developing the familial types of MTC. When inherited MTC strikes one family member, all family members can be tested. Those who test positive but have no symptoms of thyroid cancer may decide to have their thyroid removed to prevent the disease. After surgery, these patients need to take thyroid hormones for the rest of their lives.\n",
      "Treating thyroid cancer": "Surgery is the most common treatment for thyroid cancer. Your surgeon will remove all of the cancer, as well as all or part of the remaining thyroid and nearby lymph nodes.\nThe treatment of thyroid cancer also is determined by the type of cells that make up the cancer.\nYour treatment plan may also include:\nTargeted therapy and immunotherapy are most often used for thyroid cancer refractory to other treatments or advanced cancer, such as anaplastic thyroid cancer.\nA serum thyroglobulin blood test is often done after treatment to determine if any active thyroid tissues, including cancerous thyroid cells, are still present.\nYour treatment plan will depend on the type of thyroid cancer you have and how far it has spread. Each treatment causes side effects that can linger for a few months. Follow-up care can continue for decades.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if you discover a lump in your neck. Also seek medical help if you have\n",
      "Prognosis": "Thyroid cancer usually can be cured if it is found early. The outlook depends on your age, the type of cancer, the tumor's characteristics, whether the cancer has spread, and whether it was completely removed. The prognosis for MTC depends on whether the cancer occurs with no known cause, is inherited alone, or is inherited as part of a cancer syndrome (MEN-2). Regular follow-up exams are critical because the cancer can come back.\nAnaplastic carcinoma has a poorer prognosis.\n",

      "What is it?": "Ticks are tiny, biting arachnids that feed on the blood of warm-blooded animals, including humans. They burrow painlessly into the skin with their feeding parts, bite, draw blood and eventually drop off when they become engorged with blood. Only the feeding parts are inserted into the skin. The body, which is dark in color and ranges from the size of a poppy seed to a pencil eraser, remains visible on the skin surface or scalp. Ticks swell and turn bluish-gray when filled with blood. Most tick bites in the United States involve hard ticks (Ixodidae), which have been increasing in number since the middle 1900s.\n\n\nSecretions from the tick's feeding parts can cause skin reactions, such as raised areas, lumps, and growths called granulomas. Fever and paralysis also may develop after tick bites, although paralysis is rare. Paralysis is due to a toxin transmitted from the tick's secretions, not due to an infection. However, ticks can be infected with bacteria, viruses, or protozoa, and these organisms can be transmitted from the tick to the host (the animal or person) as the tick feeds, causing disease.\nTick-borne infectious diseases include:\nTicks live in tall grass and in wooded areas, particularly cool, moist, mature woods with thick undergrowth. They also can be found at the edges of woods near lawns or fields, but rarely in lawns, which are too dry and hot. Ticks wait in the underbrush for an animal or human to brush by, and then grasp the fur or skin and crawl up the leg. They don't fly, jump or drop from trees. They wander the body for 30 minutes to an hour before inserting their feeding parts into the skin.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most tick bites do not cause any symptoms. However, the following symptoms can develop as a reaction to tick secretions:\nSkin reactions include:\nTick paralysis is relatively rare. Paralysis begins in the feet and legs and gradually works its way to the upper body, arms and head over a period of hours or days. Once the tick is removed, a person with tick paralysis will recover completely. If the tick is not removed, the person can die if the muscles that control breathing are paralyzed.\nSymptoms associated with tick-borne infections differ depending on the type of infection. Common symptoms are as follows:\n\nHuman monocytic ehrlichiosis– Symptoms ranging from mild to severe can involve many organ systems. Common symptoms include high fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, weight loss and a spotted rash. Patients with weak immune systems can develop a fatal, overwhelming infection. Breathing difficulties and mental changes may also occur.\nAnaplasmosis– Symptoms ranging from mild to severe include high fever, headache, a general sick feeling (malaise), achy muscles (myalgia), nausea, vomiting, cough, stiff neck and confusion. Less than 10% of people with this disease will develop a rash.\nColorado tick fever– Flulike symptoms include fever and chills, severe headache, achy muscles (myalgia), stiff neck, light intolerance and, in some cases, a spotted rash.\nBabesiosis– Many people will not have any symptoms. Others develop fatigue, fever, drenching sweats, nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle aches, joint aches and jaundice. Patients with suppressed immune systems may develop severe disease.\nTularemia– The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Some people do not have any symptoms, but this disease also can be severe, causing septic shock and death. Common symptoms include fever, chills, headache and a general sick feeling (malaise). Many people also develop a single, red ulcerated lump with a central scab and tender, swollen lymph nodes in the area. A small number of patients develop pneumonia.\nRocky Mountain spotted fever– Symptoms include fever, headache, a spotted rash on wrists and ankles, and a patchy rash on arms and legs. Muscle aches (myalgia), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are also common.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "If you see your doctor for a tick bite, you will be asked about the size of the tick, whether it was attached to your skin and how long you think it had been attached. Your doctor will examine your skin for rashes and ask you about any symptoms that could suggest that you have developed a tick-borne infection. No further diagnostic tests are necessary unless you develop symptoms. If you develop symptoms that suggest a tick-borne illness, your physician will order a variety of blood tests to determine the cause.\n",
      "Expected duration": "A tick bite can cause many different tick-borne infections. How long each illness lasts depends on the infecting organism. In general, the tick bite itself does not cause any symptoms, although some people may develop fever, headache, nausea and a general sick feeling caused by tick secretions. These symptoms usually go away within 24 to 36 hours after the tick is removed.\nTick-induced paralysis begins in the legs five to six days after the tick has attached to the skin, and it progresses to complete paralysis over several days. Paralysis begins to improve within a few hours of removing the tick, and complete recovery takes several days.\nThe organisms that cause Lyme disease and babesiosis rarely are transmitted to the person or animal if ticks are removed within the first 24 hours after they attach and before they become engorged.\n",
      "Prevention": "To prevent tick bites in tick-infested areas, take the following precautions:\n",
      "Treatment": "When a tick is discovered on the skin or scalp, it should be removed immediately to avoid a skin reaction and to reduce the likelihood of developing a tick-borne infectious disease. Grasp the head of the tick with a pair of flat or curved forceps or tweezers held as close to the skin as possible. Avoid squeezing the tick. Gently pull the head of the tick away from the skin without twisting. The bite should be cleaned with soap and water. Save the tick in a container with a tight-fitting lid.\n\nFor people in areas where Lyme disease rates are high, one dose of doxycycline can prevent disease if taken within three days of a tick bite. So for those at highest risk, early treatment may be appropriate. This is especially important if the tick was engorged, as this suggests it was attached for long enough to transmit the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Seek medical attention if a tick has buried itself deep in the skin and you cannot remove it or if you find an engorged tick on your skin and are living in or visiting an area where Lyme disease is a risk. Fever and flulike symptoms require medical attention if you know you've recently been bitten by a tick or if the symptoms are accompanied by a skin rash, particularly the bull's-eye rash characteristic of Lyme disease. Muscle weakness or paralysis requires immediate medical attention.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If no infectious organisms have been transmitted by the tick, you should recover from symptoms within a day or two. The outlook for specific tick-borne illnesses varies.\n",

      "What is tinea versicolor?": "Many microorganisms normally live on our skin, including a group of yeast species calledMalassezia. The yeast lives in our pores. Under certain conditions, it can shift its form from a round or oval yeast shape to a string-like, branching shape. These branching forms are named hyphae. The yeast can migrate under the skin and produce azelaic acid, a substance that can change the amount of pigment (color) in new skin cells. In its hyphae form, the yeast causes a rash called tinea versicolor, also called pityriasis versicolor.\nTinea versicolor is common year-round in the tropics and subtropics and is seen in the summer months in more temperate climates. Sun exposure, use of oils on the skin, naturally oily skin and sweating are all suspected to be triggers that can cause the round or oval yeast to convert to its hyphae form, resulting in the rash. This rash can spread between people who have skin contact.\nTinea versicolor occurs more often in teenagers and young adults and appears on the back, neck, upper chest, shoulders, armpits and upper arms. Most people who get this rash are in good health. However, tinea versicolor is more likely to occur if you have a suppressed immune system, for instance, if you are taking a corticosteroid medication such as prednisone for another health problem. It is also more common in women who are taking birth control pills and in pregnant women.\n",
      "Symptoms of tinea versicolor": "The skin rash is made up of scattered pink, tan, brown or white patches on the skin. Each person will usually have only one of the colors. These patches are usually flat, without texture, but may flake. They may be small round spots or areas that start smaller then get larger and combine with other areas. The rash may be itchy, especially when a person is hot or sweaty.\n\nThe skin spots may be more obvious after skin has been exposed to the sun, because these areas do not tan evenly.\n",
      "Diagnosing tinea versicolor": "Your doctor can examine skin scrapings under the microscope to see if the yeast is present. Your doctor may also shine a black light (ultraviolet light) on the rash to help confirm the diagnosis. Yeast types in the Malassezia group may glow yellow-green under the light.\n",
      "Expected duration of tinea versicolor": "Your doctor can examine skin scrapings under the microscope to see if the yeast is present. Your doctor may also shine a black light (ultraviolet light) on the rash to help confirm the diagnosis. Yeast types in the Malassezia group may glow yellow-green under the light.\n",
      "Preventing tinea versicolor": "Because the rash occurs more readily in hot, humid conditions, keep your skin as dry and cool as possible when you are in this climate. Tinea versicolor can be spread through skin-to-skin contact or by coming in contact with contaminated articles such as towels, clothing or bedding.\nThe tinea versicolor rash continues to return in 40 percent to 60 percent of people. If you have had more than one episode of tinea versicolor, skin treatment every two weeks with a shampoo that destroys yeast (such as anti-dandruff shampoos that contain selenium sulfide) can help to prevent the rash from recurring. This may be especially helpful prior to travel to a tropical climate or during months with warm weather. Another option is to take antifungal medicines by mouth to prevent the rash from returning.\n",
      "Treating tinea versicolor": "Topical treatment should be tried first in most cases. Therapies include lotions or anti-dandruff shampoos containing selenium sulfide (Selsun), zinc pyrithione, ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral), terbinafine spray (Lamisil) and antifungal creams. Topical treatments are used one or two times each day. Treatment can last days or weeks, depending on how the rash responds.\nShort courses of oral medications, such as itraconazole [Sporanox] or fluconazole [Diflucan]), are also effective. The oral medications are usually reserved for people with a widespread rash and those who have failed topical therapy.\nFor six months after your original treatment, you may be advised to apply topical treatments occasionally or take one or more doses per month of oral antifungal medicine to help prevent the rash from returning.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have a skin rash that you think may be tinea versicolor, you should make an appointment with your doctor to have the rash evaluated.\n",
      "Prognosis": "There are no serious complications from tinea versicolor. In most people, the rash goes away with treatment. However, it takes several months for the skin to return to its normal appearance. The rash can return after treatment in some people who don't use antifungal treatments from time to time to suppress the rash.\n",

      "What is it?": "Tinnitus, commonly called ringing in the ears, is the sensation of hearing a sound in the ears when no such sound exists. This sound, which comes from inside the head, typically is described as a ringing, but it also can take the form of an annoying hiss, whistle or buzz. Tinnitus can be constant or can come and go.\nMost often, tinnitus is a symptom of an ear problem, such as:\nOccasionally, tinnitus is a side effect of medication. Aspirin in moderate to high doses often causes tinnitus.\nHealth experts estimate that more than 50 million people in the United States have some form of tinnitus\n",
      "Symptoms": "Tinnitus is a symptom in itself. However, people who have tinnitus also may have the following:\nIn addition, depending on the cause of tinnitus, there also may be\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The cause of tinnitus may be difficult to determine. Your doctor will ask if you have been exposed to loud noise at work or home and will ask about medications you take, including all herbs and supplements. He or she may look in your ears to see if you have wax blockage or if the eardrum appears abnormal. If your hearing is affected, then your doctor may have you undergo a hearing test called an audiogram to measure your hearing ability in each ear.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Nearly everyone experiences a few brief episodes of ringing in the ears at some point in life, and usually these pass without medical treatment. However, in some people with tinnitus, the problem is a persistent source of discomfort.\n",
      "Prevention": "The best way to prevent tinnitus is to avoid loud noises. Wear earplugs or ear muffs when working around loud equipment, such as chain saws, lawn mowers and high-speed power tools.\nIf you have persistent tinnitus, review your list of medications with your doctor or pharmacist to see if any may be contributing. Some people find that they can lessen the intensity of tinnitus by limiting caffeine.\n",
      "Treatment": "The treatment of tinnitus depends on its cause. People whose tinnitus is a side effect of a medication will improve when the medication is stopped or the dosage is decreased. Removing a wax blockage may improve ringing in the ear. When tinnitus is caused by Meniere's disease, the tinnitus usually remains even when the disease is treated.\nCognitive behavioral therapy helps the person reduce their negative response to tinnitus and has been shown to be help decrease the frequency and severity of symptoms.\nOther therapies that may be considered are:\nMany medications have been tried to treat tinnitus. Some people respond to antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you notice a consistent pattern of ear ringing, make an appointment for an ear exam with your doctor.\nIf you suddenly lose all hearing, seek emergency medical attention immediately.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for tinnitus depends on its cause. In people with tinnitus related to earwax buildup or medications, the condition usually will go away when the earwax is removed or the medication is stopped. In people with tinnitus related to sudden, loud noise, tinnitus may improve gradually, although there may be some permanent noise-related hearing loss.\nEven when standard medical treatments fail to relieve tinnitus, most people learn to tolerate the problem either by ignoring the sound or by using various strategies to mask the sound. In others, however, the persistent ringing affects their sense of wellness and adds to depressed mood or anxiety.\n",

      "What is it?": "Toenail fungus is a condition that disfigures and sometimes destroys the nail. It is also called onychomycosis.\nToenail fungus can be caused by several different types of fungi. Fungi are microscopic organisms related to mold and mildew.\nThese fungi thrive in the dark, moist and stuffy environment inside shoes. As they grow, fungi feed on keratin. Keratin is the protein that makes up the hard surface of the toenails.\nFactors that increase the risk of developing toenail fungus include\nHowever, many people with toenail fungus have no clear risk factors.\nToenails on the big toe and little toe are the most likely to develop a toenail fungus. This may be partly because the big toe and little toe are constantly exposed to friction from the sides of shoes.\n",
      "Symptoms": "When a toenail develops a fungal infection, it typically turns yellow or brown. It becomes thick and overgrown. Foul-smelling debris also may accumulate under the nail.\nAs the infection continues, the nail may crumble gradually and fall off.  Or, it may become so thick that the affected toe feels uncomfortable or painful inside shoes.\nA less common variety of toenail fungus is called white superficial onychomycosis. The nail turns white rather than yellow or brown. The surface becomes soft, dry, and powdery.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "You will describe your foot symptoms to your doctor. He or she will ask about any factors that may increase your risk of toenail fungus. These include\nA skin disease called psoriasis sometimes can cause nail problems that look similar to a fungal infection. As a result, your doctor may ask whether you or a family member has psoriasis. It is possible for psoriasis and a fungal infection to affect the same toenail.\nYour doctor will examine your affected toenail or toenails. Often the diagnosis can be made based on the appearance of toenails. Your doctor may take small samples of the affected nails. These samples will be sent to a laboratory where they are tested for fungi and other infectious agents.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Toenail fungus rarely heals on its own. It is usually a chronic (long-lasting) condition. It can gradually worsen to involve more and more of the nail. Even if the affected nail comes off, the new nail may be infected with fungus.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help to prevent toenail fungus:\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment may begin with your doctor removing as much of the infected nail as possible. This can be done by trimming the nail with clippers or filing it down.\nIf the infection is mild and limited to a small area of your nail, your doctor can prescribe a topical antifungal agent in the form of a cream, solution, or medicated nail polish.\nIf the infection is in a wider area of your nail, or several nails, a topical agent alone is less likely to be effective. So, your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal medication. Most commonly doctors prescribe terbinafine (Lamisil) first. A commonly used alternative is itraconazole (Sporanox).\nIn very severe cases, when toenail fungus is resistant to treatment, it may be necessary to remove the entire nail surgically.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You don't need to call your doctor unless you have pain or difficulty walking. You can show your doctor your toenails at your next office visit or schedule an appointment if you want to discuss treatment with a prescription medication.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most people treated with an oral antifungal medicine are cured after a few months of therapy. However, even after the fungus is dead, the nail may never become clear and normal-looking.\nThe fungus returns in some people even after successful treatment with an oral antifungal medication.\n",

      "What is it?": "A meniscus is a disk-shaped piece of cartilage in the knee (and in some other joints) that acts as a shock absorber inside a joint. A tear is a common form of injury to this cartilage that develops most often due to an injury or degeneration.\nEach knee has one lateral meniscus under the outer knob of the thighbone and one medial meniscus under the inner knob of the thighbone. Each meniscus acts as a natural cushion between the thighbone (femur) and shinbone (tibia). The two cushions prevent excess wear and tear inside the knee joint by keeping the ends of the two bones from rubbing together. Each meniscus also absorbs much of the shock of jumps and landings and helps to distribute joint fluid evenly to lubricate and nourish the knee.\nIn the United States, a torn meniscus is the most common reason for knee surgery.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of a torn meniscus can include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will inspect both your knees to compare your painful knee with your other one. He or she will check for signs of swelling, tenderness, and fluid inside the knee joint. If your knee is not locked, the doctor will bend your injured knee and check for clicks, snaps, and \"catches\" within the joint. Your doctor also will evaluate your knee's range of motion and will maneuver your knee to see whether your meniscus is sensitive to pressure. For example, in the \"McMurray test,\" the doctor bends the leg at the knee, and then rotates it inward or outward while straightening it. If you feel pain during this test or if there is a \"click\" sound as your leg rotates, there is a good chance that your meniscus is torn.\nIf the results of your exam suggest you have a torn meniscus, your doctor may recommend testing, such as:\n",
      "Expected duration": "If you have arthroscopic surgery to treat your torn meniscus and your job involves sedentary work (mostly sitting), you may be able to return to work one to two weeks after surgery, with full recovery in about four to eight weeks. If you are an athlete or your job requires a lot of physical activity, it may take three to four months after surgery before you feel like you have as much function in your knee as you require.\n",
      "Prevention": "Although it's hard to prevent accidental knee injuries, you may be able to reduce your risks by:\nMeniscal tears due to inflammation (such as rheumatoid arthritis) may be preventable by getting effective treatment to control the cause. Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent tears related to obesity.\n",
      "Treatment": "There are several options for treating a torn meniscus:\nIf you need surgery to correct a torn meniscus, it usually can be done using arthroscopy (camera-guided surgery) as a same-day procedure. After the procedure, you will begin physical therapy to help strengthen your knee muscles, reduce pain and swelling, and return the knee's full range of motion.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Seek medical attention if your knee:\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, the outlook is good. If your torn meniscus has been repaired surgically or partially removed, you probably will be able to resume your normal activities once you've finished physical therapy.\nAccording to long-term studies, most people who have had a meniscus repaired feel very satisfied with the results of their surgery, even 10 or 11 years after the procedure. However, some people with meniscus injuries eventually develop arthritis in the injured knee. Typically, arthritis develops many years later. The highest risk is among those who've had a part or all of the meniscus removed, because significant injuries requiring this surgery often damage the joint, but also because these surgeries take away some or all of the cushioning effect of the meniscus.\n",

      "What is it?": "The dictionary defines pigeon-toed as \"having the toes turned inward.\" No such colorful term can be found for feet that point outward. Both of these foot problems can be caused by a problem that doctors call torsional deformity. This is when the long bones of the leg are turned to the inside or outside so that the toes of the feet do not point straight ahead. Either of the two main bones in the leg can be affected the femur (between the hip and the knee) or the tibia (the larger of the two bones between the knee and the ankle). One or both legs can be affected.\nTorsional deformities can lead to toes that point inward (in-toeing) or toes that point outward (out-toeing). Parents often worry that in-toeing or out-toeing will permanently interfere with their child's ability to walk and run normally. However, in most young children, in-toeing or out-toeing is caused by a torsional deformity that appears for a short period, and then disappears during the normal stages of leg development. Most torsional deformities are temporary and correct themselves by age 6 to 8. In rare cases, in-toeing or out-toeing is a sign of a permanent bone deformity or other problem that requires medical attention.\nThese conditions may be related to one or more of the following factors:\nThe most common type of torsional deformity in toddlers is when the tibia (in the lower leg) is rotated inward, leading to in-toeing. This is caused by the child's position in the uterus before birth and usually is seen in children younger than 2. As the body works to correct this problem during development, the tibia sometimes can turn too far in the opposite direction and become rotated outward. This can cause out-toeing, but the condition usually is temporary and will go away as the child develops.\nThe most common cause of in-toeing in older children is when the femur (in the upper leg) is rotated inward. This is more common in girls than boys, and usually is seen in children 3 to 6 years old. In most cases, the cause is unknown. Some experts believe that it is related to a child's position in the uterus before birth. Others blame it on a child's position while sitting or sleeping. For example, children seem to be at higher risk of developing this problem if they frequently sit with their knees pointed forward and touching and their legs folded under, splayed to either side (in the \"W\" position). In rare cases, this condition is caused by neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy.\nOut-toeing due to an abnormal outward rotation of the femur is uncommon. The cause of this condition is unknown, but it probably is related to positioning of the legs before and after birth and usually affects both legs. In rare cases, out-toeing is seen in only one leg and may be a sign of a serious problem with the upper part of the femur bone called slipped capital femoral epiphysis.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Childhood torsional deformities usually are painless. The child usually does not notice the problem, and it typically does not interfere with the child's ability to walk, run, and play normally.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "The doctor will review your child's symptoms, family history and medical history. The doctor may ask the following:\nThen the doctor will examine your child, looking at:\nIn most cases, the doctor can make a final diagnosis based on your child's age and history, together with the results of a thorough physical examination. X-rays usually are not necessary.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Almost all torsional deformities are short-term conditions that go away before a child reaches adulthood. For example, inward rotation of the tibia usually disappears by the time a child is 3 or 4 years old, and inward rotation of the femur usually goes away before age 10.\n",
      "Prevention": "Most cases of torsional deformity represent predictable stages of development and cannot be prevented. However, in some cases sitting or sleeping in certain positions may worsen these problems. Your doctor may have suggestions regarding exercises or positions that may help to minimize any torsion.\n",
      "Treatment": "In most cases, doctors do not treat torsional deformities because these conditions usually disappear as children grow older. In very rare cases, when in-toeing or out-toeing is caused by a bone deformity, surgery may be necessary to correct the problem.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your pediatrician or family doctor if you have any concerns about the way your child walks or runs, especially if your child seems to trip or fall more often than other children of the same age.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is excellent. The majority of torsional deformities go away before adolescence.\n",

      "What is toxic shock syndrome?": "Toxic shock syndrome is a rare, life-threatening illness triggered by certain bacteria (group A streptococcal and Staphylococcus aureus). In toxic shock syndrome, toxins (poisons) produced by the bacteria cause a severe drop in blood pressure (hypotension) and organ failure. In some patients, these bacteria enter the body through an obvious break in the skin, such as a wound or puncture. Other cases are related to the use of tampons. Sometimes, however, toxic shock develops after a relatively mild injury, such as a bruise or muscle strain, or no cause is identified at all.\n",
      "Symptoms of toxic shock syndrome": "The majority (80%) of patients with group A streptococcal toxic shock syndrome have symptoms of a soft-tissue infection (pain, redness, warmth, swelling) in an area just below the skin or in a muscle. Patients with staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome may have a staphylococcal infection anywhere in the body and the site of infection may not be immediately apparent.\nSymptoms of toxic shock include:\n",
      "Diagnosing toxic shock syndrome": "Because a patient with toxic shock syndrome may be too ill to answer questions, a family member or friend may need to tell the doctor about the patient's medical history and symptoms. In general, the doctor will ask whether the patient has had any recent wounds or surgical procedures or has complained about a rash or a skin infection.\nTo help establish the diagnosis, the doctor will thoroughly examine you, including your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature), and your heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, muscles, and neurological system. Your doctor also will order the following tests to determine if the problem is caused by toxic shock syndrome or another process, and to evaluate the severity of your illness:\nIn addition, people with severe breathing difficulties will need a chest x-ray and a test for blood oxygen content.\n",
      "Expected duration of toxic shock syndrome": "Shock and other life-threatening symptoms of toxic shock syndrome can develop suddenly. Once symptoms begin, death can follow quickly if the patient is not taken to a hospital immediately. Among hospitalized patients, the length of illness varies. Many patients require prolonged hospital treatment for kidney failure, liver failure, or for severe respiratory problems that require mechanical ventilation (in which a machine breathes for the patient).\n",
      "Preventing toxic shock syndrome": "There are no specific guidelines to prevent toxic shock syndrome. You may be able to reduce your risk of developing tissue infections by promptly cleaning and treating even small skin wounds. Staphylococcal toxic shock that is related to tampon use can be avoided by changing tampons frequently.\n",
      "Treating toxic shock syndrome": "Patients with toxic shock syndrome are hospitalized and treated with:\nYour doctor may also prescribe intravenous immune globulin (and#1030;VІG) that provides additional antibodies to fight the infection.\nMechanical ventilation, dialysis, or other supportive measures may be necessary if vital organs fail.\nIn some cases of toxic shock syndrome caused by group A streptococci, when there is extensive infection of soft tissues, surgical removal of destroyed tissue may be necessary.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Toxic shock syndrome is a medical emergency. Call your doctor immediately whenever someone develops the symptoms listed above. Also, contact your doctor if a wound, puncture, or bruise becomes red, warm, swollen, or painful.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The prognosis is variable. Many people recover completely, while others may die even with prompt treatment in the hospital.\n",

      "What is toxoplasmosis?": "Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that infects a large proportion of the world's population, but rarely causes disease. Certain people, however, are at high risk of severe or life-threatening disease from this parasite. They include infants who are infected at birth, people with AIDS, people with cancer, and people who have had bone marrow or organ transplantation.\nToxoplasmosis is an infection caused byToxoplasma gondii,a single-celled parasite that spends most of its life cycle inside cats. Because an infected cat can pass millions ofToxoplasmaparasites daily in its feces, toxoplasmosis can spread easily to almost any other animal that shares the environment with cats. In humans,Toxoplasmaparasites usually enter the body by being swallowed. This can happen when people touch their mouth with soiled hands, especially after changing cat litter, or if they eat pork, lamb, or venison that has not been cooked thoroughly.\nTheToxoplasmaparasites multiply within cells that line the human digestive tract.Toxoplasmaparasites can spread to almost any organ in the body, including the brain, skeletal muscles, heart muscle, eyes, lungs, and lymph nodes. In healthy people, the body's immune system eventually stops the spread ofToxoplasmaparasites, although some remaining parasites can lie dormant indefinitely in the brain or retina.\nIn people whose immune defenses are weakened because of AIDS, cancer, or immunosuppressant medication, a new toxoplasmosis infection may spread out of control and become deadly, or dormantToxoplasmaparasites from an old toxoplasmosis infection may suddenly become active again and cause severe illness. This situation is especially dangerous for people with AIDS. In these people, dormant toxoplasmosis can reactivate and cause a severe brain infection (encephalitis), which can lead to seizures and other neurological problems.\nIf left untreated, the death rate from encephalitis is very high. In addition to being swallowed,Toxoplasmaparasites can enter the body through contaminated blood transfusions or through organ transplants taken from infected donors. Also, if a toxoplasmosis infection develops in a pregnant woman, the parasites can cross the placenta and cause toxoplasmosis in the infant. This is called congenital toxoplasmosis. These newborns are at high risk of toxoplasmosis-related eye problems and developmental disabilities.\n",
      "Symptoms of toxoplasmosis": "In people with normal immune defenses, up to 90% of cases of toxoplasmosis do not cause any symptoms, so the infection often is not recognized. In the relatively few cases in which symptoms do develop, the most common symptoms are:\nIn rare cases, patients also have experienced muscle aches, sore throat, abdominal pain, rash, or neurological symptoms.\nIn people with weakened immune systems, especially those with AIDS, symptoms of toxoplasmosis are often brain-related and severe. These symptoms can include:\nAlso, if toxoplasmosis affects the eyes of a person with a weakened immune system, there may be blurred vision, \"spots\" in the field of vision, eye pain, and extreme sensitivity to light. If toxoplasmosis affects the lungs, there can be shortness of breath, fever, a dry cough, coughing up of blood, and eventually respiratory failure.\nIf a woman develops toxoplasmosis during pregnancy or within six weeks before becoming pregnant, her child may be born with congenital toxoplasmosis. The child often does not have any symptoms at birth. However, a thorough exam usually will uncover signs of infection in the infant's eyes. Other symptoms in newborns can include:\nIn addition, congenital toxoplasmosis increases the risk of fetal death or premature birth.\n",
      "Diagnosing toxoplasmosis": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history to find out whether you have any medical problem that would weaken your body's immune defenses against toxoplasmosis, including HIV or AIDS, cancer, an inherited immune deficiency, or an organ transplant. In addition, your doctor will review your current medications to check for any drug that may suppress or damage your immune defenses, allowing dormantToxoplasmaparasites to become active. Your doctor also will ask about your exposure to cats, especially outdoor cats that kill and eat small prey. To evaluate your risk of food-related toxoplasmosis, your doctor will ask whether you often eat raw or very rare meat.\nIf you have symptoms of toxoplasmosis, your doctor will examine you to check for enlarged lymph nodes (swollen glands), signs of brain involvement, and eye damage. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will order blood tests to check for antibodies (defensive proteins made by the immune system) against theToxoplasmaparasite. Depending on your blood levels of certain antibodies, the doctor may be able to tell whether you have active toxoplasmosis or whether you had a past episode of toxoplasmosis. Most healthy people do not remember a past episode, because 90% of them never have symptoms. If you have an acute toxoplasmosis infection, the diagnosis can be confirmed by identifyingToxoplasmaparasites in samples of your blood, body fluids, or infected tissues.\nIf your doctor suspects that toxoplasmosis involves your brain, he or she will order a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your head to check for evidence of encephalitis.\nCongenital toxoplasmosis can be diagnosed before birth using ultrasound or a procedure called amniocentesis. After birth, the infant may have the following tests: eye exam, neurological exam, CT scan of the head, and laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid taken during a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).\n",
      "Expected duration of toxoplasmosis": "If you have a healthy immune system, mild symptoms of toxoplasmosis probably will subside within a few weeks, even without medical treatment. Rarely, swollen lymph nodes go away more slowly, sometimes within months. After acute symptoms pass, some dormantToxoplasmaparasites may last in the body for decades but usually will not cause any symptoms, unless the immune system is compromised.\nHowever, if you have a weakened immune system because of a disease such as AIDS, then you will need therapy for toxoplasmosis for as long as your immune system remains weak, because the disease usually returns when treatment is stopped. If your immune system is strengthened with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it may be possible to stop toxoplasmosis therapy.\n",
      "Preventing toxoplasmosis": "You can help prevent toxoplasmosis by taking the following precautions:\n",
      "Treating toxoplasmosis": "In most cases, if you are a generally healthy person, no treatment is necessary unless your symptoms are severe or unusually persistent. If toxoplasmosis affects your eyes, your doctor may treat you with a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone.\nIf you have a weakened immune system, your doctor will treat you with a combination of drugs to kill theToxoplasmaparasite. The usual treatment of choice is pyrimethamine combined with sulfadiazine. Other drugs that may be used include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin and atovaquone.\nNewborns with congenital toxoplasmosis are treated for a least one year with combination therapy — pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine or another combination that is equally effective.\nIf you develop toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, your doctor can prescribe medications that will reduce the risk that your child will develop congenital toxoplasmosis. To decrease the possibility of drug-related birth defects, the type and timing of medications depend on which trimester you are in.\nPeople treated with pyrimethamine should receive folinic acid (leucovorin) to help prevent side effects.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you develop symptoms of toxoplasmosis, especially if you are pregnant or have any medical condition that weakens the immune system. If you are planning to become pregnant, ask your gynecologist about your need for a pre-pregnancy blood test forToxoplasma.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People with AIDS who have recovered from acute toxoplasmosis are at high risk of future episodes, because the dormant parasite may be reactivated. To prevent this, doctors usually prescribe a regimen of preventive drugs, with plans to continue the medications as long as his or her immune system remains weakened.\nOne popular prophylactic drug combination — trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole — also helps to preventPneumocystis jiroveci(formerly calledPneumocystis carinii)pneumonia, an infection that targets AIDS patients with weakened immune systems.\nMany congenital toxoplasmosis cases can be cured with medications. Even children who had severe infections at birth may never show signs of severe long-term damage if they are diagnosed and treated early. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can contribute to a poor prognosis.\nIf a pregnant woman develops toxoplasmosis, her child's risk of congenital toxoplasmosis decreases 60% if she is treated properly with medication.\n",

      "Diagnosing TIA": "Your doctor will ask about:\nYour doctor will examine you. He or she may pay special attention to the circulation in your neck. This is where major arteries supplying the brain are located. While examining your neck, the doctor will listen with a stethoscope for turbulent sounds. These sounds indicate that blood is flowing through narrowed arteries.\nBlood tests will be done. Your doctor will also do a test called an electrocardiogram (EKG). An EKG measures the electrical activity of your heart.\nYour doctor may order a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain. These will help to help pinpoint the cause of a TIA.\nTo evaluate flow through blood vessels, your doctor may do other tests. These include Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or x-ray angiography.\nIf your doctor suspects that floating blood clots are coming from your heart, special heart tests may be necessary.\n",
      "Expected duration of TIA": "The onset of any symptoms suggestive of a stroke or TIA requires immediate medical attention.\nYou can expect a TIA to last less than one to two hours. If symptoms are not improving quickly within one hour from onset, a stroke is likely to occur without emergent therapy.\n",
      "Preventing TIA": "You can help to prevent TIAs by:\n",
      "Treating TIA": "When treating TIAs, the ultimate goal is to prevent a full-fledged stroke.\nMost TIAs are treated with antiplatelet medications. The choices include:\nIf you have significant narrowing of part of the carotid artery in the neck, surgery may be done to correct the problem. This will help prevent future TIAs and stroke. The procedure is called carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting.\nSome TIAs are related to small free floating blood clots in the heart. These clots can occur in people with atrial fibrillation or advanced heart failure. In this situation, your doctor may choose anticoagulation (anti-clotting) medications such as a direct oral anticoagulant drug.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately whenever anyone has symptoms of stroke. Call even if these symptoms last only a few minutes. TIAs can be a warning sign that a stroke is about to happen. They require prompt attention.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Without treatment, having a history of one or more TIAs significantly increases your risk of stroke compared with someone who has never had a TIA.\n",

      "What is it?": "In a normal hip joint, the rounded top of the thigh bone (femur) fits into a cup-shaped socket in the pelvis called the acetabulum. This type of joint is called a ball-and-socket joint. When the top of the femur moves out of its normal position in the socket, the hip is said to be dislocated.\nA hip can become dislocated during many kinds of accidents, including falls from high places and motorcycle or car accidents. When this injury occurs in a head-on car crash, it is often nicknamed a \"dashboard dislocation,\" because it happens when the knee strikes the dashboard.\nA traumatic hip dislocation is a medical emergency and needs to be treated immediately, ideally within six hours. That is because the injury stops blood from reaching the top of the femur, depriving the bone of its vital oxygen supply. Unless the dislocated hip is replaced in its socket promptly and normal circulation is restored within the hip joint, the top part of the femur can be permanently damaged. This permanent damage is called avascular necrosis.\nBecause traumatic hip dislocations often occur during serious high-impact accidents, up to 50% of patients also have a fractured bone in some part of the body, particularly in the upper part of the femur.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In an accident victim, a traumatic hip dislocation can cause the following symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Doctors usually diagnose a traumatic hip dislocation by examining the hip joint. X-rays will be done to confirm the diagnosis, to see where the head of the femur is located, and to check for fractures in the hip area. In some cases, a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be helpful to provide additional details about the nature of the injury and to help determine the best treatment.\n",
      "Expected duration": "The hip will improve after initial treatment, and pain should subside. It is common, however, for a person to require crutches for a short time after treatment and to have a limp that continues for weeks. Complete healing of the hip and surrounding tissue can take two or three months. Your doctor may prescribe a physical therapy program to strengthen muscles and ligaments around the hip and reduce the chance that the hip will become dislocated again.\nA person with significant pain after a hip dislocation may have developed the complication avascular necrosis from injury to the hip's blood supply. Avascular necrosis may require surgery and can make the recovery period much longer.\n",
      "Prevention": "Wear a seat belt while driving or riding in a car, and take advantage of recommended safety equipment at work or during recreation.\n",
      "Treatment": "If you have a traumatic hip dislocation and there is no x-ray evidence of a fractured femur, the doctor probably will treat the dislocation in the emergency room without surgery. To accomplish this, the doctor will give you medications to ease your pain and relax your hip muscles. Once your hip muscles are relaxed, the doctor will move the head of your femur back into its socket. X-rays will confirm that its position is correct.\nIf you have a fractured femur in addition to your hip dislocation, your doctor will correct both injuries surgically.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately if you cannot move your hip joint after a fall or other traumatic injury, or if your affected hip is painful, swollen, tender, or deformed.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Although the outlook depends on many factors, the timing of treatment is particularly important. For example, one study showed that 88% of patients had good or excellent results if a dislocated hip was restored to its normal position in its socket within six hours after injury. After six hours, the risk of permanent damage increased significantly, and it was highest when treatment was delayed for 24 hours or more.\nAbout 20% of people with an uncomplicated hip dislocation (that is, without a fracture or avascular necrosis) eventually suffer from early arthritis in the affected hip.\n",

      "What is it?": "Traveler's diarrhea is an infection of the intestines that affects up to 50% of people who visit the developing world. It comes from eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water.\nTraveler's diarrhea usually is caused by viruses (especially norovirus) and bacteria (most commonlyE. coliorCampylobacter). It also can be caused by parasites. The diarrhea is usually not serious and goes away without treatment. However, when diarrhea is very watery and occurs often, dehydration may occur. Dehydration is the biggest danger of traveler's diarrhea.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most episodes of traveler's diarrhea occur in the first or second week of the trip. Symptoms vary depending on what organism causes the problem. People have at least three loose stools per day and often a lot more. They also may experience fatigue, decreased appetite, abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Usually there is no blood in the stool (feces).\n",
      "Diagnosis": "People know they have traveler's diarrhea based on their symptoms. If symptoms last longer than five days or if you develop fever or severe abdominal pain, see a doctor. Your blood and stool may be tested for evidence of infection. In some cases, a doctor might be able to identify the infecting organism, which could lead to a specific treatment.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Traveler's diarrhea usually improves on its own within five days.\n",
      "Prevention": "Many cases of traveler's diarrhea can be prevented. Keep the following rules in mind, even in expensive resorts and hotels:\nCommon side effects of bismuth subsalicylate include black stools and a temporary black discoloration of your tongue. If you develop ringing in the ears, stop taking the medication because you may be developing salicylate toxicity. Aspirin and bismuth subsalicylate contain the same active ingredient, so if you need to take aspirin for health reasons, limit the use of bismuth subsalicylate. If you are allergic to aspirin, are pregnant, or have a history of kidney disease, ulcers, or other bleeding disorders, consult your doctor before taking bismuth subsalicylate.\nDo not take antibiotics to prevent diarrhea unless your doctor tells you to. Antibiotics can have side effects, including sensitivity to sun, allergic reactions, and vaginal yeast infections.\n",
      "Treatment": "Dehydration is the biggest danger of traveler's diarrhea, so replacing fluids is extremely important. If you have mild diarrhea, drink broth and diluted fruit juice or sport drinks. Alternate salty and sweet beverages (such as tomato juice and fruit juice) to replace your body's electrolytes. Electrolytes are the charged particles that make up salt. Electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium play a crucial role in many functions of your body's cells.\nIf you have severe diarrhea (more than five unformed stools a day), it's best to drink an oral rehydration solution to replace the electrolytes you're losing. Pharmacies in most countries carry these products, which can be mixed with clean drinking water. You also can make your own solution by adding a half-teaspoon of salt, a half-teaspoon of baking soda and 4 tablespoons of sugar to 1 liter of clean water.\nKeep in mind that fruit juice, broth, and sports drinks do not contain the right concentration of electrolytes for this purpose.\nIn most cases, traveler's diarrhea ends within three to five days without antibiotic treatment. However, it is a good idea to get a prescription from your doctor, and bring the antibiotic medication with you in case you need it. The general advice is to take antibiotics if you develop moderate or severe symptoms, such as fever, more than four episodes of diarrhea per day, or blood or mucus in the stool.\nIf you develop milder symptoms, taking a single dose of antibiotic may lead to faster improvement of your symptoms.\nAntimotility medications such as loperamide (Imodium) may help to decrease the frequency of bowel movements, but they cannot prevent diarrhea and they do not get rid of the infection. They are useful for long bus or car trips or other situations where access to a bathroom is unavailable or inconvenient. These drugs may actually prolong the duration of symptoms with certain bacterial infections.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Get medical attention if traveler's diarrhea does not end within five days, or if you develop a high fever, bloody stool, or severe abdominal pain.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Traveler's diarrhea is inconvenient, but it is rarely serious. The most worrisome complication is severe dehydration.\n",

      "What is it?": "Trichomoniasis, nicknamed \"trich,\" is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a microscopic one-celled organism calledTrichomonas vaginalis. Trichomoniasis can cause vaginal infections in women and inflammation of the urethra (the tube that drains urine from the bladder) in both sexes. In pregnant women,Trichomonasinfections also can increase the risk of premature rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In women,Trichomonasorganisms can live in the vagina for many years without causing symptoms. If symptoms occur, they can include:\nIn rare cases there will be discomfort in the lower abdomen. Symptoms may be worse during a menstrual period. Although men usually have no symptoms, they occasionally can have irritation and inflammation at the tip of the penis, discomfort during urination, and a discharge from the end of the penis.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Once you describe your symptoms, your doctor will check your vagina or urethra for inflammation and abnormal discharge, and do a pelvic examination. During the exam, he or she will collect a specimen with a swab, and send it to a laboratory to be examined. Trichomoniasis can be diagnosed by viewing the parasite under the microscope in the office or more accurately by culturing it in the laboratory. Because people withTrichomonasinfections are more likely to get other STDs, your doctor also may perform tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and HIV.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Without treatment,Trichomonasinfections can last for years.\n",
      "Prevention": "Because trichomoniasis can be transmitted during sexual activity, you can help to prevent infection by:\n",
      "Treatment": "Trichomonasinfections are best treated with oral medication, usually metronidazole (Flagyl). Although metronidazole gel is also available, it is not as effective as medication taken by mouth. Alternative treatments include oral tinidazole or secnidazole. To prevent becoming infected again, all sex partners of an infected person must be treated and refrain from intercourse until treatment is complete. Pregnant women should not take metronidazole during the first trimester of pregnancy, so an alternative medication should be used or treatment should be delayed until later in pregnancy.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you are a woman, call your doctor whenever you have vaginal discomfort or an abnormal vaginal discharge, especially if you are pregnant. If you are a man, call your doctor whenever you have redness or discomfort around the end of your penis.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If you are a woman, call your doctor whenever you have vaginal discomfort or an abnormal vaginal discharge, especially if you are pregnant. If you are a man, call your doctor whenever you have redness or discomfort around the end of your penis.\n",

      "What is trigeminal neuralgia?": "Trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux, is a painful disorder of a nerve in the face called the trigeminal nerve or fifth cranial nerve. There are two trigeminal nerves, one on each side of the face. These nerves are responsible for detecting touch, pain, temperature, and pressure sensations in areas of the face between the jaw and forehead.\nPeople who have trigeminal neuralgia usually have episodes of sudden, intense, \"stabbing\" or \"shocklike\" facial pain. This pain can occur almost anywhere between the jaw and forehead, including inside the mouth. However, it usually is limited to one side of the face.\nIn some cases, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is unknown. In many people, however, something seems to be irritating the trigeminal nerve, usually in the area of the nerve's origin deep within the skull. In most cases, the irritation is believed to be caused by an abnormal blood vessel pressing on the nerve. Less often, the nerve is being irritated by a tumor in the brain or nerves. Sometimes the problem is related to a rare type of stroke. In addition, up to 8% of patients who have multiple sclerosis (MS) eventually develop trigeminal neuralgia as a result of MS-related nerve damage.\nNew cases of trigeminal neuralgia affect four to five of every 100,000 people in the United States each year. It affects women slightly more often than men, possibly because the disease is most common in older people and women live longer. The first episode of facial pain usually occurs when the patient is 50 to 70 years old. Although infants, children, and young adults may develop this disorder, it is rare in people younger than age 40.\n",
      "Symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia": "Trigeminal neuralgia causes episodes of sudden, intense facial pain that usually last for two minutes or less. In most cases the pain is described as excruciating, and its quality is \"sharp,\" \"stabbing,\" \"piercing,\" \"burning,\" \"like lightning,\" or \"like an electric shock.\" In most cases, only one side of the face is affected.\nThe pain of trigeminal neuralgia is recognized as one of the most excruciating forms of pain known. The pain often is triggered by nonpainful facial movements or stimuli such as talking, eating, washing the face, brushing the teeth, shaving, or touching the face lightly. In some cases, even a gentle breeze on the cheek is enough to trigger an attack. Approximately 50% of patients also have specific trigger points or zones on the face, usually located somewhere between the lips and nose, where an episode of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by a touch or a temperature change. In some cases, a sensation of tingling or numbness comes before the pain.\nAttacks of trigeminal neuralgia can vary significantly and may occur in clusters, with several episodes following in series over the course of a day. For unknown reasons, trigeminal neuralgia almost never occurs at night when the person is sleeping.\nSome patients also have a cheek twitch or muscle spasm, wincing, a facial flush, a tearing eye, or salivation on the same side of the face. It is the facial muscle spasms that led to the older term, tic douloureux (in French, tic means muscle twitch or spasm; douloureux means painful).\n",
      "Diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and your medical history, including any history of multiple sclerosis, a condition that may cause similar or even identical symptoms. To help rule out medical and dental conditions that can have similar symptoms, your doctor also will ask whether you have a history of:\nNext, your doctor will thoroughly examine your head and neck, including the area inside your mouth. The doctor also will do a neurological examination and concentrate on feeling and muscle movements in your face. In almost all cases of trigeminal neuralgia, the results of these examinations are normal. If necessary, your doctor will order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan of your head to check for blood vessel abnormalities, tumors pressing on your trigeminal nerve, or other possible causes of your symptoms.\nYour doctor will diagnose trigeminal neuralgia based on your symptoms, the examination, and test results. There is no specific test to confirm the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, so an important part of the diagnosis is excluding other explanations for the symptoms.\n",
      "Expected duration of trigeminal neuralgia": "The course of trigeminal neuralgia is unpredictable. Many people experience periods when the illness suddenly gets worse and causes repeated painful episodes over several days, weeks, or months. This period may be followed by a pain-free interval that can last for months or years.\nThe type of treatment may influence how long your symptoms last. Some treatments carry a higher risk that the symptoms will return.\n",
      "Preventing trigeminal neuralgia": "Because the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is unknown, it cannot be prevented.\n",
      "Treating trigeminal neuralgia": "Doctors typically prescribe carbamazepine (Tegretol) or oxcarbazepine (Oxtellar XR, Trileptal) as the initial treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. These anticonvulsant medicines decrease the ability of the trigeminal nerve to fire off the nerve impulses that cause facial pain. If they are not effective, other possible drug choices include phenytoin (Dilantin), gabapentin (Neurontin), lamotrigine (Lamictal), topiramate (Topamax), and valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote). Sometimes lidocaine (an anesthetic drug) or sumatriptan (a treatment for migraines) may be helpful. A muscle relaxant such as baclofen (Lioresal) can be tried alone or in combination with one of the anticonvulsants.\nSome of these medications carry the risk of unpleasant side effects, including drowsiness, liver problems, blood disorders, nausea, and dizziness. For this reason, people taking any of these medications may be monitored with frequent follow-up visits and periodic blood tests. After a few pain-free months, your doctor may attempt to decrease the dose of the medication gradually or discontinue it. This is done to limit the risk of side effects, and to determine whether your trigeminal neuralgia has gone away on its own.\nIf medication does not stop your pain or if you cannot tolerate the side effects of medication, then your doctor may suggest one of the following treatment options:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "You should seek medical help immediately if you develop facial pain that fits the pattern of trigeminal neuralgia.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most cases, the outlook is good. Approximately 80% of patients become pain-free with medication alone. When medication fails or produces unwanted side effects, other treatment options are available and also have a high rate of success.\n",

      "What is tropical sprue?": "Tropical sprue is a digestive problem that occurs in the tropics and subtropics. People with tropical sprue do not absorb nutrients properly, especially vitamin B12and folic acid.\nNormal small intestines have fingerlike projections called villi that provide more surface area for nutrients to be absorbed. In people with tropical sprue, these villi are flattened, making absorption difficult.\nTropical sprue is rare except in a specific geographical zone. It occurs from about 30 degrees north of the equator to 30 degrees south of it. It is more common in certain countries within this tropical area, including India, Southeast Asian countries, Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. The condition afflicts residents of the affected countries as well as travelers, though usually it affects only travelers who stay for a month or longer.\nThe cause of tropical sprue has not been identified, but many experts suspect that an intestinal infection is to blame. When tropical sprue occurs, the lining of the small intestine is damaged so that it is unable to absorb nutrients efficiently.\n",
      "Symptoms of tropical sprue": "Diarrhea is the main symptom of tropical sprue. Meals with fatty foods can cause oily, foul-smelling stools. Other symptoms include cramps, nausea, weight loss, gas and indigestion.\n",
      "Diagnosing tropical sprue": "Diagnosis of tropical sprue can require a series of tests because many conditions have similar symptoms. Your physician will order stool and blood tests to check for other causes of diarrhea. If these are negative and you have lived in the tropics for a long period, then tropical sprue is a potential cause for your illness. The most common way to confirm the diagnosis of tropical sprue is to do a biopsy, in which small piece of tissue is removed from your small bowel to be examined under a microscope. To do this procedure, your doctor will need to examine your stomach and small intestines through a small camera on a flexible cord (an endoscope) that is gently passed into your mouth and down your esophagus.\nCertain blood tests also can give an indication that you might have tropical sprue. Because the disease blocks certain vitamins and minerals from being absorbed, you may have low levels of albumin, calcium, or vitamins D, A, K, and E. You also may have anemia (a low count of red blood cells) due to vitamin B12and folate deficiencies. In addition, stool specimens may demonstrate an excess amount of fat.\n",
      "Expected duration of tropical sprue": "Once treatment has started, most people are relieved of symptoms within weeks.\n",
      "Preventing tropical sprue": "Other than avoiding tropical climates, there are no known ways to prevent tropical sprue.\n",
      "Treating tropical sprue": "Treatment is usually three to six months of an antibiotic named tetracycline or doxycycline, and folic acid (also called folate) supplements. People with vitamin B12deficiency will receive vitamin supplements as well.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Contact your doctor if you have diarrhea that does not respond to over-the-counter treatments. If you have lived in a tropical country and you have persisting diarrhea, you should be tested for parasitic infections and your doctor should consider whether you may have developed tropical sprue. Once you are undergoing treatment for tropical sprue, contact your doctor's office if the condition does not respond after several weeks.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook for tropical sprue in travelers is usually excellent. In about 20% of tropical residents who have tropical sprue, the disease comes back after treatment.\n",

      "What is it?": "The bacterium that usually causes tuberculosis in humans is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Many millions of people worldwide are infected with tuberculosis. However, most do not show signs of the disease. In these people, the bacteria are inactive (latent) and cannot be transmitted to others. If the body's immune system weakens, tuberculosis can become active and cause disease.\nTuberculosis typically affects the lungs. But in up to one-third of infected people, particularly those with HIV/AIDS, the illness also involves other areas of the body. Common sites of infection include the lymph nodes, the membranes that cover the brain (meninges), the joints, the kidneys and the membrane covering the digestive organs (peritoneum).\nTuberculosis bacteria are spread from person to person through the air. The bacteria are in droplets of secretions that come out of your mouth or nose when you cough or sneeze. One-time exposure to someone with tuberculosis is not likely to cause infection. Repeated or prolonged exposure is usually necessary. Touching someone with tuberculosis will not lead to infection, because the bacteria infect the lungs only when they are inhaled into the lungs.\n\nWhen infection occurs, a bacteria-filled droplet is inhaled into the deepest portion of the lung, where the bacteria reproduce (replicate) and spread through the body. At this point, the immune system usually can keep the bacteria from replicating any more, but usually cannot destroy them completely.\nThe disease usually remains in this inactive or dormant state for life. People with inactive tuberculosis do not have any symptoms. Inactive TB can be diagnosed by a special skin test or blood test.\nActive tuberculosis occurs in several different forms:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Most people infected with tuberculosis have inactive disease that does not cause any symptoms. In these people, a skin test for tuberculosis (called a PPD skin test, for \"protein purified derivative\") will show positive results within three months of getting the infection. Once a PPD is positive, it usually will remain positive throughout life.\nAmong people with active tuberculosis, symptoms vary according to the type of disease:\nThere usually is also a cough, which eventually produces discolored mucus. As the illness progresses, people may cough up blood (sometimes in large amounts), become short of breath and ultimately develop severe breathing problems.\nAlthough the bacteria are spread throughout the body, there may not be any other symptoms. But if there are, they can occur nearly anywhere. Some of the more common symptoms are:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about symptoms such as cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats, swollen glands and breathing problems. He or she also will ask whether you have ever been exposed to anyone with tuberculosis, and if you have ever traveled to developing countries where tuberculosis is common.\nYour doctor will examine you. He or she will ask if you have ever had a tuberculosis skin test and what the results showed. If your doctor suspects that you have active pulmonary tuberculosis, he or she will have you get a chest X-ray or chest CT scan. Your doctor will have you cough up samples of mucus (sputum), which will be stained with special chemicals and then examined for the presence of bacteria. The sputum also will be cultured, which means it is tested to see if tuberculosis bacteria grow.\nPeople with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis may have a normal chest X-ray and negative stains and cultures of their sputum. In these cases, other techniques are used to help make the diagnosis including:\n",
      "Expected duration": "Once someone's healthy immune system has controlled a primary tuberculosis infection, the bacteria usually will remain inactive for life. A PPD skin test may be positive in these people, indicating a history of tuberculosis infection, but the lifetime chance of developing active TB disease is only about 10%, unless your immune system is weakened by a disease such as HIV/AIDS or medications that suppress the immune system.\nIf you develop active tuberculosis disease, it takes up to two weeks of treatment before you can no longer spread tuberculosis to other people. However, it takes several months or longer to complete successful treatment. In some cases, patients are infected with strains of tuberculosis that are resistant to the most commonly used and effective antibiotics. These resistant strains can take up to 24 months to treat.\n",
      "Prevention": "In developing countries with high rates of tuberculosis, a vaccine against the disease often is given at birth. The vaccine is not used routinely in the United States and most European countries because the risk of transmission in these countries is low, and because the vaccine is not very effective.\nPeople with a positive skin test for TB (PPD) or who test positive on a interferon-gamma release assay blood test may be advised to take a course of antibiotics to prevent reactivation. The decision depends on their age and risk of reactivation of dormant infection.\n",
      "Treatment": "Doctors usually treat tuberculosis with a combination of four drugs, such as isoniazid (INH), rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), pyrazinamide (pms-Pyrazinamide, Tebrazid) and ethambutol (Myambutol). This combination is considered first line treatment. The therapy usually lasts 6 months or longer. It is very important that you take these medications as prescribed to prevent the bacteria from becoming resistant to the drugs. It is also important that all of your close contacts are screened for tuberculosis, so they can be treated if they are infected.\nTuberculosis strains that are resistant to isoniazid and rifampin (the two most effective tuberculosis antibiotics) are called multidrug resistant (MDR-TB). To cure MDR-TB, patients must take combinations of \"second-line\" tuberculosis medications: ethionamide (Trecator-SC), moxifloxacin (Avelox), levofloxacin (Levaquin), cycloserine (Seromycin), kanamycin (Kantrex) and others. These medications are more likely to cause side effects than first-line drugs are. Also they are not as effective so they must be taken for up to two years.\nExtensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) strains have been identified in many countries throughout the world. These strains are resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, the aminoglycoside drug family (such as kanamycin), and the quinolone drug family (such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin). XDR-TB is very difficult to treat, and sometimes, surgery is necessary to remove the diseased portion of the lung.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you develop cough, fever, weight loss, swollen glands, night sweats or other symptoms of tuberculosis. You also should call your doctor if you have been exposed to someone with active tuberculosis. Ask your doctor about your need for routine PPD testing if you often travel to developing countries or work in an environment where tuberculosis risk is high, such as a medical facility or institution.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Tuberculosis that is not resistant to medication is almost always cured if the person complies with the treatment regimens and antibiotics are started before major parts of the lung are destroyed. People who are infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis strains may have less chance of being cured, depending on which drugs they are resistant to and how much lung damage they have before effective treatment is started.\nWithout proper treatment, more than half of people with active tuberculosis will die within five years.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Type 1 diabetes is a disease in which the body does not make enough insulin to control blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes was previously called insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes.\nDuring digestion, food is broken down into basic components. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose.  Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body's cells.  To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the blood and get inside the cells.\nInsulin traveling in the blood signals the cells to take up glucose.  Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. When levels of glucose in the blood rise, like following a meal, the pancreas normally produces more insulin.\nType 1 diabetes occurs when some or all of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed. This leaves the patient with little or no insulin. Without insulin, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream rather than entering the cells. As a result, the body cannot use this glucose for energy.  In addition, the high levels of glucose that remain in the blood cause excessive urination and dehydration, and damage tissues of the body.\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means it begins when the body's immune system attacks cells in the body. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells (beta cells) in the pancreas.\nWhy the immune system attacks the beta cells remains a mystery. Some people are genetically predisposed to the disease. That does not mean they will necessarily get the disease. It just means that they are more likely to do so.  Something in the environment, such as particular viral infections or something about the diet, may trigger this autoimmune disease in people with a genetic predisposition.\nType 1 diabetes is not caused by the amount of sugar in a person's diet before the disease develops.\nType 1 diabetes is a chronic disease. It is diagnosed most commonly between ages 10 and 16. Type 1 diabetes equally affects males and females.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Initial Symptoms\nSymptoms usually come on suddenly and strongly. Typically the most prominent symptoms are excessive urination and extreme thirst. This is because the increased glucose in the blood causes the kidneys to create more urine than usual. Losing more fluid in the urine makes a person dehydrated. And dehydration leads to great thirst. Children may start to wet the bed again.\nWeight loss, with no loss of appetite, also is common. The weight loss is due in part to dehydration. Water has weight.  Imagine holding a gallon jug of water: it weighs about eight pounds. People with new, uncontrolled type 1 diabetes can lose a gallon of water from dehydration.\nOther common symptoms are weakness, fatigue, confusion, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms can be caused both by dehydration and by a condition called ketoacidosis.\nKetoacidosis occurs because cells can't use the glucose they need for energy. So the cells have to use something else. In response to low insulin levels, the liver produces an alternative fuel called ketones. Ketones are a kind of acid. When they build up in the blood, it's called ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis can cause heart problems and affect the nervous system. Within hours, it may put a person at risk of coma or death.\nEven after it is diagnosed and treatment is begun, type 1 diabetes can affect all body systems. It is less likely to damage the body, and cause symptoms, if the blood sugar levels are well controlled by treatment.\nThe serious and potentially life-threatening complications that can occur with type 1 diabetes include:\nHypoglycemia can lead to coma if it is not corrected by eating or drinking carbohydrates. Glucagon is a substance that makes the liver release glucose into the bloodstream. An injection of glucagon can also correct hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed by a combination of symptoms, a person's age and blood tests.  The blood tests include tests for sugar levels and for other substances.\nFasting plasma glucose (FPG) test.Blood is taken in the morning after fasting overnight. Normally, blood sugar levels remain between 70 and 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Diabetes is diagnosed if a fasting blood sugar level is 126 mg/dL or higher.\nOral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).Blood sugar is measured two hours after drinking 75 grams of glucose. Diabetes is diagnosed if the 2-hour blood sugar level is 200 mg/dL or higher.\nRandom blood glucose test.A blood sugar of 200 mg/dL or greater at any time of day combined with symptoms of diabetes is sufficient to make the diagnosis.\nHemoglobin A1C (glycohemoglobin).This test measures the average glucose level over the prior two to three months. Diabetes is diagnosed if the hemoglobin A1C level is 6.5% percent or higher.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Type 1 diabetes currently is a lifelong disease.\nPeople with type 1 diabetes need regular checkups. They must carefully monitor their blood sugar levels every day. They must receive insulin treatment throughout life.\nA small number of people can become exceptions to this rule. Some people with diabetes eventually require kidney transplants. A transplant of the pancreas, or of the insulin-producing cells from the pancreas (called \"islets\"), sometimes is performed at the same time. Since the new pancreas can make insulin, this can cure the diabetes.\nOn unusual occasions, when someone's type 1 diabetes is very hard to control with available treatments, pancreas or islet transplantation may be performed even when kidney transplantation is not necessary. However, this approach is still experimental, and is not generally recommended.\nScientists have recently reported exciting but still experimental new ways for encouraging the pancreas to again start producing its own insulin-producing beta cells.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no proven way to prevent type 1 diabetes.  Vitamin D deficiency, which is very common, may increase the risk of diabetes.  However, correcting the deficiency has not been yet shown to prevent diabetes.  Likewise, avoiding cow's milk during infancy may possibly prevent type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible infants. But there is no definite proof that this prevents the disease.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment of type 1 diabetes requires daily insulin injections. The injected insulin makes up for the insulin that is not produced by the body. Most people with type 1 diabetes need two to four injections per day.\nPeople with type 1 diabetes must properly regulate both their dietary intake and their dose of insulin. If a person takes too much insulin relative to their dietary intake, or if they forget to eat, they can develop dangerous hypoglycemia.  If they take too little insulin, or eat too much, they can develop ketoacidosis.\nIn order to properly regulate their insulin intake, people with type 1 diabetes need to monitor their blood sugar levels several times per day. They do this by testing a sample of blood. They must prick their finger and place a small drop of blood on a test strip. The test strip is inserted into a device called a glucose monitor. An accurate reading of blood sugar levels is returned within seconds.\nNewer glucose monitors have test strips that take the blood directly from the spot that was pricked. This process requires less blood. Other monitors allow blood to be taken from the forearm, thigh or the fleshy part of the hand. This can be less painful.\nSome people use a syringe for injections. Other patients use semiautomatic injector pens that help to measure precise amounts of insulin.\nAn increasing number of patients use insulin pumps. Insulin pumps deliver a regulated dose of insulin through a needle implanted under the skin. The insulin pump is worn in a pack on the body. Some pumps include a sensor that constantly measures the level of blood sugar, and adjusts the dose of insulin accordingly.  Whether devices with such sensors lead to improved health is not yet certain.\nFast-acting insulin may be taken as needed, depending on the amount of carbohydrates ingested. Your doctor or dietitian will help you determine the best insulin and diet schedule for you or your child.\nA healthy diet and regular exercise are important for everyone—but particularly for people with diabetes.  A healthy diet for someone with type 1 diabetes not only keeps the amount of glucose in the blood relatively constant. It also includes eating \"good carbs\" instead of \"bad carbs\", \"good fats\" instead of \"bad fats\".\nIn order to keep blood sugar levels at a normal and relatively constant level, a person with type 1 diabetes typically is advised to eat, exercise and take insulin at about the same times every day. Regular habits help to keep glucose levels within the normal range.\nPeople with type 1 diabetes should get regular exercise. Exercise protects the health of the heart and blood vessels in people with diabetes, as in everyone.  In addition, regular exercise helps to control blood sugar by causing muscles to use glucose and by keeping body weight down. Ask your doctor how much and when to exercise to best control your diabetes.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "Call your health care professional if you experience a sudden increase in thirst and urination. Unexplained weight loss always should be reported to a physician.\nIf you or your child has type 1 diabetes, see your doctor regularly to make sure that you are keeping good control of your blood sugar. You should also be checked regularly for early signs of complications such as heart disease, eye problems and skin infections.\nYour doctor most likely will suggest that you also visit other specialists regularly. These may include a podiatrist to check your feet and an ophthalmologist to check your eyes for signs of diabetes complications.\n",
      "Prognosis": "People with type 1 diabetes generally adjust quickly to the time and attention that is needed to monitor blood sugar, treat the disease and maintain a normal lifestyle.\nAs time goes on, the risk of complications is substantial. But it can be reduced greatly if you strictly monitor and control your blood glucose levels.\n",

      "What is type 2 diabetes?": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease. It is characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is also called type 2 diabetes mellitus and adult-onset diabetes. That's because it used to start almost always in middle and late adulthood. However, more and more children and teens are developing this condition. Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes, and is really a different disease. But it shares with type 1 diabetes high blood sugar levels and the complications of high blood sugar.\nDuring digestion, food is broken down into basic components. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body's cells. To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the blood and get inside the cells.\nInsulin traveling in the blood signals the cells to take up glucose. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen. When levels of glucose in the blood rise (for example, after a meal), the pancreas produces more insulin.\nType 2 diabetes occurs when your body's cells resist the normal effect of insulin, which is to drive glucose in the blood into the inside of the cells. This condition is called insulin resistance. As a result, glucose starts to build up in the blood.\nIn people with insulin resistance, the pancreas \"sees\" the blood glucose level rising. The pancreas responds by making extra insulin to maintain a normal blood sugar. Over time, the body's insulin resistance gets worse. In response the pancreas makes more and more insulin. Finally, the pancreas gets \"exhausted.\" It cannot keep up with the demand for more and more insulin. It poops out.  As a result, blood glucose levels start to rise.\nType 2 diabetes runs in families. Obesity greatly increases the risk of diabetes.\n",
      "Symptoms of type 2 diabetes": "The symptoms of diabetes are related to high blood glucose levels. They include:\nExtremely high blood sugar levels also can lead to a dangerous complication called hyperosmolar syndrome. This is a life-threatening form of dehydration. In some cases, hyperosmolar syndrome is the first sign that a person has type 2 diabetes. It causes confused thinking, weakness, nausea and even seizure and coma.\nThe treatment of type 2 diabetes also can produce symptoms. Too much glucose-lowering medicine, relative to dietary intake, can lead to the complication of low blood sugar (called hypoglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia include:\nYou can correct hypoglycemia by eating or drinking something that has carbohydrates. This raises your blood sugar level.\nType 2 diabetes affects all parts of the body. It can cause serious, potentially life-threatening complications. These include:\n",
      "Diagnosing type 2 diabetes": "Diabetes is diagnosed by testing the blood for sugar levels. Blood is tested in the morning after you have fasted overnight.\nTypically, the body keeps blood sugar levels between 70 and 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), even after fasting. If a blood sugar level after fasting is greater than 125 mg/dL, diabetes is diagnosed.\nYour doctor will examine you to look for:\nLaboratory tests are also used routinely to evaluate diabetes. These include:\n",
      "Expected duration of type 2 diabetes": "Diabetes is a lifelong illness. However, people with type 2 diabetes can sometimes restore their blood sugar levels to normal just by eating a healthy diet, regularly exercising, and losing weight.\nAging and episodic illness can cause the body's insulin resistance to increase. As a result, additional treatment typically is required over time.\n",
      "Preventing type 2 diabetes": "If a close relative — particularly, a parent or sibling — has type 2 diabetes, or if your blood glucose test shows \"prediabetes\" — defined as blood glucose levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL — you are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. You can help to prevent type 2 diabetes by:\nIf you already have type 2 diabetes, you can still delay or prevent complications:\n",
      "Treating type 2 diabetes": "",
      "Diet and exercise": "In most cases, type 2 diabetes treatment begins with weight reduction through diet and exercise. A healthy diet for a person with diabetes is:\nFor some people, type 2 diabetes can be controlled just with aggressive weight loss and exercise. Even if medications are required, diet and exercise remain important for controlling diabetes.\n",
      "Medications": "Metformin.Oral metformin remains the first go-to drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It's available as a generic, so it's very affordable. Also, metformin does not cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when used alone. The most common side effects are abdominal discomfort and irregular bowel habits.\nAccording to new guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), doctors should consider adding either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT-2 inhibitor if blood sugar levels are still too high despite metformin or a person has an increased risk of cardiovascular or kidney disease. The ADA recognizes that the high cost of these newer drugs can be an obstacle to their use.\nGlucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.These drugs mimic the effects of a substance the gut produces naturally to spur the pancreas to make more insulin. These drugs also slow down the emptying of the stomach, which may make people feel full longer. Examples include liraglutide (Victoza), semaglutide (Ozempic) and dulaglutide (Trulicity).\nSodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. These drugs work by blocking the kidney's ability to reabsorb sugar. They act as diuretics and produce other effects on the kidney, which are likely what makes them effective in preventing heart disease and lowering blood pressure. Examples include empagliflozin (Jardiance), canagliflozin (Invokana), and dapagliflozin (Farxiga).\nBoth have side effects. When a SGLT2 blocks the kidney's ability to reabsorb sugar, it increases sugar levels in the urine, exposing your kidneys and bladder higher levels of glucose. This can lead to infections. These medications are associated with a fourfold increase in vaginal yeast infections and a more modest increase in urinary tract infections. GLP-1 receptor agonists slow down digestion, which can help with weight loss but can also produce unpleasant symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in 15% to 45% of people who take them.\nGLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have additional health benefits beyond helping with blood sugar control:\nWeight loss.Both can help a person with diabetes shed pounds. But the GLP-1 receptor agonists are more effective for weight reduction compared with the SGLT-2 inhibitors.\nHeart disease.Drugs from both classes lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with diabetes. For people with heart failure and diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors have been shown to decrease hospitalizations and improve survival. Because of these benefits, doctors are beginning to use SGLT-2 inhibitors even in nondiabetic heart failure patients.\nChronic kidney disease.SGLT-2 inhibitors can slow down the progression of diabetic kidney disease and may help prevent kidney failure related to other conditions.\n",
      "Insulin": "Because type 2 diabetes develops when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance. In advanced type 2 diabetes, or for people who want to tightly control glucose levels, insulin may be needed more than once per day and in higher doses.\nTreatment plans that include both very long-acting insulin and very short-acting insulin are frequently the most successful for controlling blood sugar. Very short-acting insulin is used with meals, to help control the spike in blood sugar levels that occur with a meal. If a person does not eat on a regular schedule, very short-acting insulin can be particularly helpful.\nThe most worrisome side effect of insulin is low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). The usual symptoms are sudden weakness, sweating, feeling unwell and not thinking clearly. However, people with low standing diabetes may lose the ability to feel these symptoms even with a dangerously low blood sugar level.\n",
      "Other medicines": "In addition to medicines that help control the level of blood sugar, people with type 2 diabetes often take other medicines that reduce the risk or to slow the onset of the complications of diabetes. These include medications that:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you have diabetes, see your doctor regularly.\nPeople with high blood sugar levels have a higher risk of dehydration. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop vomiting or diarrhea and are not able to drink enough fluids.\nMonitor your blood sugar as advised by your health care team. Report any significant deviations in blood sugar levels.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Your treatment plan is likely to require adjustment over time. Insulin resistance increases with age. And the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas may wear out as the pancreas tries to keep up with the body's extra insulin needs.\nAfter the first few years, the majority of people with type 2 diabetes require more than one medicine to keep their blood sugar controlled.\nThe prognosis in people with type 2 diabetes varies. It depends on how well an individual modifies his or her risk of complications. Heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease can result in premature death.

      "What is it?": "Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease. It usually begins in the rectum, then worsens to involve some or all of the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong condition.\nUlcerative colitis may begin with a breakdown in the lining of the intestine. The inside of the intestine, with its digested food, contains trillions of bacteria. Normally, the lining of the intestines keeps these bacteria from causing an infection of the wall of the intestine.\nAs long as the bacteria are contained, they remain invisible to your immune cells. They do not provoke a reaction. But when the intestine's lining fails, bacteria that usually are harmless can activate your immune system.\nUlcerative colitis is an autoimmune disease. This means that the immune system, which is supposed to attack foreign things that get inside our bodies, instead attacks a part of the body.\nIn ulcerative colitis, the bowel bacteria provoke the immune system to attack the wall of the intestine itself, injuring the bowel.\nThere also is evidence that unusually large or small numbers of certain types of bacteria that normally live in everyone's gut can make the gut vulnerable to ulcerative colitis.\nOnce the bowel inflammation has started, it can continue. It continues even if the immune system stops being exposed to the bowel bacteria.\nUlcerative colitis affects the inner lining of the rectum and colon. This causes the lining to\nSometimes, other parts of the body are affected by the inflammation. These include the eyes, skin, liver, back, and joints.\nThe disease is not contagious. Contact with another person cannot spread the disease.\nUlcerative colitis usually begins to cause symptoms between the ages of 15 and 40.\nUlcerative colitis substantially increases the risk of colon cancer.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of ulcerative colitis vary. Some people with the disease have a burst of symptoms every few months. Others have symptoms all the time. Some, fortunately, have symptoms only rarely.\nTypical symptoms include\nUlcerative colitis also may cause\n",
      "Diagnosis": "To confirm a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, most patients have either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Both procedures use a small camera and light to view the insides of your large intestine.\nA biopsy may be done during either procedure. In a biopsy, small samples of tissue are clipped from the lining of the intestine. They may be examined for signs of inflammation.\nMany temporary conditions, such as infections, cause the same symptoms as ulcerative colitis. Therefore, your doctor will want to test your stool for other conditions such as bacterial infections or parasite infections.\nBlood tests may also be done to check for anemia (low red blood cell count) or low iron levels. These are common in ulcerative colitis. Other blood tests may be recommended to exclude other causes of bowel inflammation.\nBlood tests may be done to detect inflammation, and to check on your liver. Inflammation of the liver ducts occurs in some people with ulcerative colitis.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong condition, unless the large intestine is surgically removed. Most people with ulcerative colitis do not have their colon removed. That is because their symptoms can be controlled with medication. Or, they only have symptoms once in a while.\nIn ulcerative colitis, the inflammation is not always active. There can be long breaks between symptoms.\nEach time ulcerative colitis acts up, symptoms can last for weeks or months. Often these flare-ups are separated by months or years of good health with no symptoms.\nSome people notice that certain foods aggravate their symptoms. By managing their diet, these people can increase the time between flare-ups.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent ulcerative colitis.\nHowever, some people are able to decrease the frequency of symptoms. They do this by avoiding foods that seem to provoke flare-ups. For some people with ulcerative colitis, this includes spicy foods and milk products.\nIf you have ulcerative colitis, you can decrease the toll it takes on your body. To do this, eat a well-balanced, nutritious diet — especially when you are not having symptoms such as poor appetite and nausea that make it hard to eat. By doing so, you can decrease complications from malnutrition, such as weight loss or a low blood count.\nUlcerative colitis increases your risk of colon cancer. People with extensive inflammation in the whole colon have the highest risk. It is important to have your colon checked frequently for early signs of cancer. Ask your doctor how often you should have a colonoscopy.\nPoor nutrition or the effect of colitis medicines can lead to osteoporosis. This disease weakens bones and can cause bones to break. Osteoporosis can be prevented with medicines, adequate exercise, calcium, and vitamin D. If you have ulcerative colitis, discuss osteoporosis with your doctor.\n",
      "Treatment": "",
      "Medications": "Medications are very effective for improving the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Most of the medications used work by preventing inflammation in the intestine.\nA group of anti-inflammatory medicines called aminosalicylates are usually tried first. These medicines are chemically related to aspirin. They suppress inflammation in the gut and in joints. They are given\nAminosalicylates clear up symptoms in most people. But you may need to receive treatment for three to six weeks before you are free of symptoms.\nOther, more powerful anti-inflammatory medicines are prescribed when the disease is very active or it cannot be controlled with an aminosalicylate. Often, the first choice of an anti-inflammatory drug is a corticosteroid, such as prednisone or a steroid foam.\nWhen these medications are not effective, one or more other immune-suppressing treatments may be recommended. These may include one or more of the following: azathioprine, cyclosporine, an anti-tumor necrosis factor medication (such as infliximab), vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, upadacitinib, or ozanimod.\nDoctors are always concerned about side effects from the anti-inflammatory and immune-suppressing medicines, especially the increased risk of infection. So the goal is to reduce the dose and then stop the anti-inflammatory drug once the disease is under control.\nYou may also be given medicines to decrease painful spasms of the colon.\nWhen symptoms are severe or when diarrhea causes dehydration, you may need to be hospitalized to receive intravenous fluids, steroids, antibiotics, and sometimes intravenous nutrition while the colon recovers.\n",
      "Surgery": "Surgery is used in people who have\nAfter some surgeries, bowel movements will have to leave the body through an opening in the abdominal wall. This opening is called a stoma. The stoma replaces the function of the rectum. It may be connected to a drainage bag. The stoma may be used temporarily or permanently.\nNewer surgical techniques allow many patients to keep the muscular layer of the rectum while still removing the rectal lining. This type of surgery has a cosmetic advantage. And, it allows bowel movements to pass through the rectum. Bowel movements are near normal, except that they are more frequent and contain more liquid.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "New or changing symptoms often mean that additional treatment is needed. People who have ulcerative colitis should be in frequent contact with their physicians.\nCommon symptoms that require a doctor's immediate attention are\nA serious, but uncommon, complication is called toxic megacolon. This results when the colon inflammation is so severe that it stops the colon's motion. Megacolon causes the abdomen to swell. This can cause vomiting or severe abdominal pain and bloating. Megacolon requires emergency treatment, often surgery.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Ulcerative colitis can affect people very differently. Many people have only mild symptoms. They do not require continuous treatment with medicines.\nOthers might require multiple medicines or surgery. Unless it is treated with surgery, this disease is a lifelong condition.\nUlcerative colitis requires people to pay special attention to their health needs. They must also seek frequent medical care. But most people can have normal jobs and productive lives.\nIt can be helpful for a person newly diagnosed with ulcerative colitis to join a support group of other people with the disease.\n",

      "What is it?": "An undescended testicle, also called cryptorchidism, is a testicle that has not moved down into the scrotum. Early in pregnancy, the testicles begin developing deep within the abdomen, influenced by several hormones. At 32 to 36 weeks' gestation, the testicles begin to descend into the scrotum. In 30% of premature and approximately 3% of full-term male infants, one or both of the testicles have not completed their descent at the time of birth. Most of these will then descend spontaneously during the first three to six months of life. By 6 months of age, less than 1% of babies still have the problem. Either one or both testicles can be affected.\nAn undescended testicle increases the risk of infertility (not being able to have children), testicular cancer, hernias, and testicular torsion (twisting). An empty scrotum also can cause significant psychological stress as the boy gets older. For these reasons, early treatment is very important.\nSome boys have a normal descended testicle at birth that then appears to move back up into the abdomen when they are between 4 and 10 years old. This condition is called an acquired undescended testicle. This is thought to occur when, for unknown reasons, the spermatic cord attached to the testicle does not grow as quickly as the rest of the child does.\nSometimes, a temporary situation called a retractile testicle is mistaken for an acquired undescended testicle. In this condition, a testicle that has descended fully into the scrotum occasionally retracts into the abdomen. The retraction is caused by an overactive reflex in the cremasteric muscle that pulls the testicle out of the scrotum. Boys who are anxious or ticklish during a testicular exam may have this overactive reflex. A retractile testicle does not increase the risk of infertility or testicular cancer because it always comes back down into the scrotum.\n",
      "Symptoms": "There is usually only one sign that a boy has an undescended testicle. The scrotum appears underdeveloped or smaller on the affected side. In rare cases, the undescended testicle can become twisted (testicular torsion), causing severe groin pain. If this happens, seek medical attention immediately.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "During a physical examination, the doctor will be able to see that one or both testicles is absent from the scrotum. In the majority of cases, the doctor can feel the testicle above the scrotum. If the doctor cannot find and feel the testicle, a specialist needs to determine its position using a procedure called diagnostic laparoscopy. In this procedure, a specially designed video camera is inserted through a small incision to look at an area inside the body directly.\n",
      "Expected duration": "The majority of undescended testicles descend into the scrotum on their own during the first three to six months of life. If the testicle has not descended by 6 to 9 months of age, it should be evaluated by a specialist.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent this condition because the exact cause is not known.\n",
      "Treatment": "A persistent undescended testicle usually is treated between 6 months and 2 years of age. Most cases can be corrected with a surgical procedure called orchiopexy, in which the surgeon brings the testicle down into the scrotum through the normal abdominal opening and then stitches it into place. Occasionally, more extensive surgery is required.\nHormone injections may be tried prior to surgery. The hormones that are used stimulate the testicles to produce higher amounts of testosterone. This may help the testicle move down into the scrotum.\nIf the testicle is absent or needs to be removed because it is abnormal, then testicular prostheses (artificial implants) can be considered later in life.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Consult a doctor for a thorough examination if one or both testicles cannot be felt within the scrotum. Seek medical attention immediately for severe groin pain.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook is best if the condition is recognized and corrected before 2 years of age.\nOrchiopexy may reduce the risk of infertility because normal sperm production requires the cooler temperature found in the scrotum. After treatment, 50% to 65% of males with two undescended testicles are fertile, and 85% with a single undescended testicle are fertile.\nOrchiopexy increases the likelihood of early detection of a testicular cancer. The procedure also may reduce the risk of developing cancer if done an early age.\n",

      "What is urethritis?": "Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. Urethritis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection. Much less often, it is the result of an injury from an instrument such as a urinary catheter or exposure to an irritating chemical such as an antiseptic or a spermicide.\nDoctors have historically classified sexually transmitted (infectious) urethritis into two categories: gonococcal urethritis, caused by gonorrhea bacteria, and nongonococcal urethritis, caused by bacteria other than gonorrhea.\nGonococcal urethritis, commonly called clap, is caused byNeisseria gonorrhoeaebacteria. Gonorrhea infections are passed from person to person during sexual activity (vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse).\nNongonococcal urethritisis caused by all sexually transmitted bacteria other thanN. gonorrhea. The most frequent cause isChlamydia trachomatisbacteria, which cause the sexually transmitted infection Chlamydia. Nongonococcal urethritis is the one of the most common forms of sexually transmitted infection. In addition toC. trachomatis, other possible infectious causes of nongonococcal urethritis includeMycoplasma genitaliumandTrichomonas vaginalis.\nNot all urethritis is caused by an infection or trauma. Reactive arthritis (formerly known as Reiter's syndrome) is an inflammatory disorder that usually has three features:\n",
      "Symptoms of urethritis": "The main symptoms of urethritis are pain or burning during urination and an urge to urinate more frequently. Another symptom is redness around the opening of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. Men with gonococcal urethritis also often have a yellow discharge from the urethra.\nWomen are less likely to have symptoms from sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.\n",
      "Diagnosing urethritis": "Your doctor will ask about your sexual history, including new partners and condom use. Your doctor will look for an abnormal discharge from your urethra. In women, a pelvic examination will be done to look for tenderness, redness or abnormal discharge from the cervix and vagina. Because urethritis usually is caused by sexually transmitted infections, your doctor will examine you for signs of other infections, such as  syphilis, genital warts caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) and HIV.\nUrethritis caused by injury or chemical irritation is diagnosed based on your medical history and the absence of an infectious cause.\n",
      "Expected duration of urethritis": "Once you start taking antibiotics, infectious urethritis improves rapidly. Even without treatment, the symptoms of gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis usually go away within three months. However, people continue to remain infectious, and spread the bacteria to others even when they have no symptoms. Untreated infections can spread from the cervix to the fallopian tubes in women, where they can cause permanent scarring and infertility.\nUrethritis caused by injury or chemical irritation goes away without treatment once the cause is identified and avoided.\n",
      "Preventing urethritis": "Because both gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis are caused by bacteria that can be transmitted during sexual intercourse, you can prevent these infections by:\nHaving sexually transmitted urethritis may increase your risk of HIV infection. If you already have HIV, urethritis may increase the risk that you will pass HIV to a sex partner.\nUrethritis caused by injury or chemical irritation is rare, and there is no way to prevent it. Once it occurs, avoiding the offending substance should prevent urethritis from recurring.\n",
      "Treating urethritis": "Infectious urethritis can be treated with a variety of antibiotics. Because certain strains of bacteria have become resistant to specific antibiotics, your doctor may need to prescribe a different antibiotic if symptoms continue after you have finished taking the first prescription.\nAll sex partners of a person infected with infectious urethritis also should be treated. People who are taking antibiotics for urethritis should not have sex until treatment is complete.\nBecause many people have gonorrhea and chlamydia at the same time, health experts recommend that all people treated for gonorrhea receive treatment for chlamydia as well. For this reason, you may need to take two types of antibiotics, because many commonly used antibiotics treat only one of the two infections.\nNo specific treatment is needed for urethritis caused by injury or chemical irritation. Your doctor may prescribe phenazopyridine (Pyridium) to ease any burning or pain with urination.\nUrethritis associated with reactive arthritis is treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Men should call a doctor if they notice an abnormal discharge from the penis. Women should seek medical attention if they develop an unusual vaginal discharge or bleeding or pain during intercourse. Both men and women should call a doctor if they start urinating more frequently, or if urination causes pain or a burning discomfort, especially if fever or chills occur. Men and women, especially pregnant women, should call a doctor if they participate in sexual activity with someone who has gonorrhea or chlamydia.\nMen and women who have sex with multiple partners should schedule a routine physical examination every year, even if they have no symptoms of sexually transmitted infections. In women, this physical examination should include a pelvic exam.\n",
      "Prognosis": "If gonococcal urethritis is diagnosed and treated quickly and correctly, there usually is complete recovery. Gonococcal urethritis that is not treated correctly or not treated at all can lead to advanced pelvic inflammatory disease in women, which can result in scarring that can lead to infertility. Antibiotic treatment of chlamydia will cure this disease and can prevent complications. If untreated, chlamydia infections in men can cause swollen and tender testicles.\nUrethritis caused by injury or chemical irritation will almost always go away once the cause is avoided.\nUrethritis associated with reactive arthritis will often recur.\n",

      "What is the test?": "A urinalysis is a routine examination of the urine for cells, tiny structures, bacteria, and chemicals that suggest various illnesses, including infection, diabetes, kidney problems and liver disease. A urine culture attempts to grow large numbers of bacteria from a urine sample to diagnose a bacterial urine infection.\n",
      "How do I prepare for the test?": "For a regular urinalysis, you are asked to urinate briefly into a plastic cup. When urine is collected for a urine culture, you must provide a \"clean catch\" sample - one that is not contaminated by skin cells and skin bacteria. This is so the doctor can obtain a sample of urine from inside your bladder, where normally there should be no bacteria. In contrast, there are many bacteria on the skin of a penis or in a vagina. The trick (harder for a woman than a man) is to pee directly into a sterile container without having the stream of urine first touch your skin or the nonsterile tissues of the vagina.\nTo collect a clean catch sample, you are given a sterile plastic container and asked to wipe off the area around your urethra (where urine exits) with an antiseptic cloth. For women, it's also helpful to hold the two labia (outer walls) of the vagina apart with one hand when you urinate, so that the stream of urine passes directly into the sterile container. Since the first flow of urine is most likely to be contaminated by bacteria from around the opening of the urethra, first urinate for a moment into the toilet and then use the cup to collect the \"middle\" portion of your urine stream.\n",
      "What happens when the test is performed?": "For a regular urinalysis, your urine is tested both chemically and by microscopic exam. Chemical examination uses a \"dipstick\" to reveal the pH (acidity) and concentration of your urine, while simultaneously testing for several chemicals at once. Some chemicals indicate that blood in general and white blood cells in particular might be present, a sign of a urinary infection, kidney stones, or other problems. Nitrite, a chemical produced by most bacteria, suggests a bacterial infection. Sugar in the urine is a sign of diabetes (high blood sugar), while chemicals known as ketones can indicate a diabetic complication. Protein in the urine can indicate kidney disease or impaired kidney function.\nA microscopic examination is done after the urine is spun inside a tube in a centrifuge. This concentrates the solid particles at the bottom of the tube, so they can be studied more easily. Microscopic examination can show red blood cells, white blood cells, bacteria, crystals, skin cells that might have contaminated the sample, and, rarely, parasites in your urine. In some cases, the way the cells look offers your doctor clues about whether they entered your urine from the bladder or the kidney.\n",
      "What risks are there from the test?": "None.\n",
      "Must I do anything special after the test is over?": "No.\n",
      "How long is it before the result of the test is known?": "Your doctor might be able to do a urinalysis in his or her office and can give you the results within 10-15 minutes. If the urine is sent to a separate laboratory, it usually takes several hours to get results, so you may not hear from your doctor until the next day. A urine culture takes 24 to 72 hours to complete, so you may not hear results for several days.\n",

      "What is it?": "The urinary tract includes the kidneys, the ureters (the tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder), the bladder, and the urethra (the tube that allows urine to exit from the bladder to outside the body).\nUrinary health can be maintained by making lifestyle choices that help avoid infections and other problems. Common problems include:\nBladder infection (cystitis)— Bladder infections are extremely common in women of all ages. An infection almost always starts when bacteria enter the opening where urine comes out (urethra). Once bacteria enter a woman's urethra, they only have to travel a short distance to reach the bladder.\nBladder infections are uncommon in younger men. In men over age 50, a bladder infection is usually associated with an enlarged prostate or a prostate infection.\nKidney infection (pyelonephritis)— A kidney usually becomes infected because bacteria have traveled to the kidney from an infection in the bladder. Kidney infections occur more commonly\nPyelonephritis is more common in women than in men.\nUrethritis— Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra. It is usually caused by sexually transmitted diseases (such as chlamydia and gonorrhea). Urethritis can also be caused by contact with an irritating chemical (such as antiseptics, bubble baths, and some spermicides) or by irritation from an object, such as a tube (catheter) inserted to drain urine.\nKidney stones— Kidney stones are abnormal, hard chemical deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can be as small as a grain of sand or as big as a pea or marble — or even larger. Some of these larger stones are too big to be flushed from the kidney. Other kidney stones manage to travel from the kidney into the ureter, where they become trapped.\nCancer— The most common types of cancer in the urinary tract are bladder cancer and kidney cancer. Cancers of other parts of the urinary tract are uncommon.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of specific conditions involving the urinary tract vary depending on the condition.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Many people have occasional episodes of brief discomfort when they start urinating. Usually this is caused by irritation, and does not need to be treated. Make an appointment with your doctor if discomfort while urinating lasts longer than a brief moment, is severe, or if it happens frequently.\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and your personal and sexual habits. During a physical examination, the doctor will check for tenderness over the kidneys and examine your genitals. For women, this may include a pelvic exam. Men with suspected prostate problems may have a digital rectal exam.\nIf your doctor thinks you have a simple bladder infection, he or she usually can confirm this with a urine test in the doctor's office.\nTo diagnose urethritis, the doctor may order a special urine test or may take a swab of the infected area and send it for testing.\nIf your doctor suspects you have a kidney infection, he or she will ask you to give a urine sample, which will be sent to a laboratory to identify the exact species of bacteria causing the infection. If you have a fever or appear ill, your doctor may take a blood sample to check for bacteria in the blood.\nIf your doctor is concerned about a kidney stone or cancer, further studies such as a CT scan will usually be performed.\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long a urinary condition lasts depends on its cause. Most people with infections of the urinary tract respond well to treatment within a few days. When the cause is more difficult to determine or more serious, symptoms may last longer.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent bladder and kidney infections, be sure to stay well hydrated with several glasses of water each day to flush out your urinary tract. Women should wipe from front to back after having a bowel movement. They should also urinate soon after sexual intercourse to flush bacteria away from the urethra. This helps prevent bacteria from moving into the bladder.\nTo help prevent sexually transmitted diseases, practice safe sex. This includes always using a condom unless you have only one steady sexual partner.\nTo help prevent kidney stones, drink plenty of fluids and avoid dehydration. Staying hydrated dilutes your urine and decreases the chance that chemicals in your urine will combine to form stones.\nYou can prevent the most common type of kidney stones, known as calcium oxalate stones, by eating low-fat dairy products and other calcium-rich foods. Taking calcium supplements, however, can increase the risk of stone formation. People who excrete too much oxalate into their urine should avoid eating foods high in oxalate. These foods include beets, spinach, chard, and rhubarb. Tea, coffee, cola, chocolate, and nuts also contain oxalate, but these are safe to consume in moderation. Eating too much salt and meat can cause more kidney stones to form.\nNot using tobacco products is the best way to prevent bladder cancer and other cancers of the urinary tract.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment depends on the condition.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor or seek urgent care if you have painful urination or blood in the urine and any of these other symptoms:\n",
      "Prognosis": "A single episode of infection in the bladder, urethra, or kidney usually goes away completely after treatment with antibiotics if treated promptly. In most cases, there is very little risk of long-term damage. However, women with certain sexually transmitted diseases can experience scarring of the reproductive tract and fertility problems if the infection is not promptly diagnosed and treated.\nUp to half of people who pass a kidney stone will never pass a second one. For people with recurrent kidney stones, the prognosis depends on the cause of the kidney stones and the person's response to preventive therapies.\nThe outlook for cancer of the urinary tract continues to improve with new therapies.\n",

      "What is urinary incontinence?": "Urinary incontinence is a loss of control over urination. Urine leaks before you are able to get to a toilet.\nNormally, kidneys make urine that travels through tubes (called ureters) into the bladder. The bladder is a balloon-shaped structure with walls of muscle. The muscular walls are relaxed until the bladder fills up. The underside of the bladder is supported by pelvic floor muscles.\nWhen the bladder is full, the walls of the bladder are stretched. That signals the muscular walls to squeeze down, causing an urge to urinate. When you are ready to urinate, the muscular walls squeeze down harder, and another tube (the urethra) opens up that carries urine out of the bladder and into the outside world.\nWith the various types of urinary incontinence, this normal process gets disrupted.\nOne type of incontinence is stress incontinence. Your pelvic muscles are located beneath your bladder. Stress incontinence occurs when your pelvic muscles aren't strong enough. They cannot withstand a \"stress\" or pressure pushing on the bladder.\nWhen your pelvic muscles give way, they release their squeeze around the bottom of your bladder. As a result, urine can drain out.\nStress incontinence is common during\nAnother common type of urinary incontinence is urge incontinence. This is also called overactive bladder. In overactive bladder, the bladder becomes overly sensitive to stretching and nerve signals. As a result, the muscles of the bladder start to tense up, causing an urge to urinate when your bladder is only partly filled. Also, your bladder can squeeze after only a minimal trigger.\nMany women have urinary incontinence after childbirth. Pregnancy and childbirth can affect the conditioning of the pelvic muscles. They can also stretch and injure the pelvic nerves. Incontinence may last for a surprisingly long time after childbirth.\nTemporary urinary incontinence is frequently caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI). Infection of the vagina or irritation of the vagina from lack of estrogen (vaginitis) is another cause of temporary incontinence.\nNeurologic problems such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury can cause incontinence. They can cause the bladder to overfill and overflow. Or they can cause the bladder to empty unpredictably.\nIncontinence can be a complication of radiation treatment or prostate surgery.\nSome people have normal bladder function and control. But they are not able to move easily. This can lead to urinary incontinence because the person cannot get to the bathroom in time.\nUrinary incontinence is more common in women than in men.\n",
      "Symptoms of urinary incontinence": "The main symptom of urinary incontinence is leakage of urine. This leakage can be frequent or rare. It can be a soaking or a small squirt.\nUrge incontinence can cause leakage during sleep.\nA urinary tract infection is likely to be causing incontinence if urine leakage is accompanied by\n",
      "Diagnosing urinary incontinence": "Your doctor will review your medical history.\nYour doctor may ask you to keep a voiding diary for one to three days. You should record:\nA neurological examination and a pelvic examination may be done. These will help to reveal the cause of your urinary incontinence.\nYou may also have a test to see whether you can empty your bladder completely. You will be asked to urinate to empty your bladder. Then, the amount of urine left in the bladder will be measured.\nYour doctor should check for a urinary tract infection.\nIf your doctor suspects that nerve injury is causing your incontinence, you may need an imaging study. This may be a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain or spinal cord.\n",
      "Expected duration of urinary incontinence": "Urinary incontinence may be a short-term problem. This is likely if it is related to pregnancy or to a UTI.\nUrinary incontinence is more often a long-term problem if it results from\n",
      "Preventing urinary incontinence": "There is not much to be done to prevent urinary incontinence from starting. Obese women are more likely to develop urinary incontinence. So are women who don't exercise regularly. Thus, regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent you from developing incontinence.\nOn the other hand, once incontinence starts, the problem can be treated effectively to reduce or eliminate the number of episodes.\n",
      "Treating urinary incontinence": "",
      "Kegel exercises": "Many women can improve or eliminate urinary incontinence by doing pelvic muscle exercises. These are called Kegel exercises. They strengthen the muscles that surround the openings of the urethra, vagina, and rectum.\nTo do Kegel exercises, squeeze your muscles to tighten your rectum and vagina. Hold Kegel squeezes for six to eight seconds. Group eight or 12 squeezes into each session. You can repeat these exercises several times each week.\nKegel exercises are particularly helpful for stress incontinence. They can also help control other types of incontinence. It can take several months or longer to see benefits.\n",
      "Bladder retraining": "Urge incontinence can be improved by retraining. The goal is to help your bladder become less sensitive to the things that trigger its tendency to squeeze down and create a tremendous urge to urinate — or urination itself.\nThe squeezing of your bladder is a conditioned response. You need to give your bladder a period of time when it is not stimulated by the signal of a full bladder. This helps your bladder to be less \"jumpy.\"\nTo accomplish this, empty your bladder on a rigid schedule before it becomes full. You may need to urinate every half hour or hour. Gradually lengthen the interval between your bathroom stops. Your bladder may not respond as urgently after several weeks of retraining.\nYou also can improve urge incontinence by calming your bladder signals. Try not to race to the bathroom when you feel an urge to urinate. Instead, try sitting and breathing deeply for a short time. Or do Kegel exercises to distract your bladder.\nSome specialists provide bladder sphincter biofeedback. This shows levels of bladder, rectum, and abdominal pressure during Kegel squeezes or during relaxation techniques.\n",
      "Medications": "Many medications are available to reduce symptoms of urge incontinence. Initial choice often depends upon cost and potential risk of side effects.\nWomen who have a UTI are given antibiotics. Curing the infection ends the incontinence caused by infection.\nSome postmenopausal women have vaginitis caused by too little estrogen. Estrogen creams or tablets in the vagina can be helpful.\nOnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections into the bladder wall can help reduce incontinence. They needed to be repeated every three to six months after their initial injections.\n",
      "Devices to strengthen the pelvic muscles": "Your doctor may recommend using cone-shaped weights. You place one of these cones into your vagina before you begin pelvic muscle exercises. These maximize the muscle-conditioning effect of Kegel exercises.\n",
      "Pessaries": "Urine leakage may be caused when the uterus sags into the vagina (a condition called uterine prolapse), bending the urethra. In these cases, a pessary may help. A pessary is a firm rubber ring that supports the bottom of your uterus, and keeps it from prolapsing. It can be inserted in the vagina by a physician and worn continuously.\n",
      "Surgery": "A common cause of stress incontinence in women is lack of support at the bladder neck. Surgery may be considered when other treatments have been ineffective.\n",
      "Other strategies": "If your urine leaks when you cough, seek treatment for your cough. If your cough results from smoking, talk to your doctor about ways to quit.\nPads or adult diapers can offer security. But they can also irritate the skin. They should not be the first or only strategy used for incontinence.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you experience urinary incontinence, tell your doctor. He or she can provide basic treatments for urinary incontinence. For more persistent symptoms, your doctor may refer you to specialist with expertise in evaluating and treating urinary incontinence.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most women who seek treatment for urinary incontinence find that their symptoms improve. Bladder retraining can lead to good results after only a few weeks. Kegel exercises improve urine control in many women who use them consistently.\nSurgery for urinary incontinence can be very successful. But it can result in one or more complications. These include:\n",

      "What is a urinary tract infection?": "Urinary tract infections involve the parts of the body — the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra — that produce urine and carry it out of the body. Urinary tract infections often are classified into two types based on their location in the urinary tract:\n\nMost cases of urinary tract infections occur in women. Of those that occur in men, relatively few affect younger men. In men older than 50, the prostate gland (a gland near the bottom of the bladder, close to the urethra) can enlarge and block the flow of urine from the bladder. This condition is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH. This condition can prevent the bladder from emptying completely, which increases the likelihood that bacteria will grow and trigger an infection. Cystitis is more common in men who practice anal intercourse and in those who are not circumcised. Other factors that increase the risk of urinary infections include an obstruction, such as that caused by a partial blockage of the urethra known as a stricture, and non-natural substances, such as rubber catheter tubes (as may be inserted to relieve a blockage in the urethra).\n",
      "Symptoms of a urinary tract infection": "A urinary tract infection usually causes one or more of the following symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosing a urinary tract infection": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and about any previous episodes of urinary tract infection. To fully assess your risk factors, your doctor may ask about your sexual history, including your history and your partner's history of sexually transmitted diseases, condom use, multiple partners and anal intercourse.\nYour doctor will diagnose a urinary tract infection based on your symptoms and the results of a physical examination and laboratory tests of your urine. In a typical urinary tract infection, your doctor will see both white blood cells (infection-fighting cells) and bacteria when he or she examines your urine under a microscope. Your doctor probably will send your urine to a laboratory to identify the specific type of bacteria and specific antibiotics that can be used to eliminate the bacteria.\nIn men, a rectal examination will allow your doctor to assess the size and shape of the prostate gland. If you are a young man with no sign of an enlarged prostate, your doctor may order additional tests to search for a urinary tract abnormality that increases the likelihood of infection. This is because urinary tract infections are relatively rare in young men with normal urinary tracts. Additional tests may include intravenous pyelography or a computed tomography (CT) scan, which shows an outline of your urinary tract on X-rays; ultrasound; or cystoscopy, an examination that allows your doctor to inspect the inside of your bladder using a thin, hollow tube-like instrument.\n",
      "Expected duration of a urinary tract infection": "With proper treatment, most uncomplicated urinary tract infections begin to improve in one to two days.\n",
      "Preventing a urinary tract infection": "Most urinary tract infections in men cannot be prevented. Practicing safe sex by using condoms will help to prevent infections that are transmitted through sexual contact.\nIn men with benign prostatic hypertrophy, cutting out caffeine and alcohol or taking certain prescription medications may help to improve urine flow and prevent the buildup of urine in the bladder, which increases the likelihood of infection. Many men with urinary infections due to an enlarged prostate gland require surgery to remove part of the gland. Because this surgery can improve urine flow, it can help prevent infections.\n",
      "Treating a urinary tract infection": "Doctors treat urinary tract infections with a variety of antibiotics. The results of laboratory tests on your urine can help your doctor pick the best antibiotic for your infection. In general, most uncomplicated lower tract infections will be eliminated completely by five to seven days of treatment. Once you finish taking the antibiotics, your doctor may ask for a repeat urine sample to check that bacteria are gone. If an upper tract infection or infection of the prostate is diagnosed, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics for three weeks or longer.\nMen with severe upper tract infections may require hospital treatment and antibiotics given through an intravenous catheter (in a vein). This is especially true when nausea, vomiting and fever increase the risk of dehydration and prevent the use of oral antibiotics.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have any of the symptoms of a urinary tract infection.\nIf you are approaching age 50, call your doctor if you notice any of the following: a decrease in the force of your urine stream, difficulty in beginning urination, dribbling after you urinate, or a feeling that your bladder isn't totally empty after you finish urinating. These could be symptoms of an enlarged prostate, a problem that can be treated effectively before it triggers a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most urinary tract infections can be treated easily with antibiotics. In a man who has a urinary tract abnormality or an enlarged prostate, repeated urinary tract infections may occur as long as the underlying problem continues to interfere with the free flow of urine.\n",

      "What is it?": "The uterus and the bladder are held in their normal positions just above the inside end of the vagina by a \"hammock\" made up of supportive muscles and ligaments. Wear and tear on these supportive structures in the pelvis can allow the bottom of the uterus, the floor of the bladder, or both to sag through the muscle and ligament layers.\nWhen this occurs, the uterus or bladder can create a bulge into the vagina. In severe cases, it is possible for the sagging uterus or bladder to work its way down far enough that the bulge can appear at the vagina's opening or even protrude from the opening.\nWhen the uterus sags downward, it is called uterine prolapse. When the bladder sags, it is called bladder prolapse, also known as a cystocele.\nVarious stresses can cause the pelvic muscles and ligaments to weaken and lead to uterine or bladder prolapse. The most significant stress on these muscles and ligaments is childbirth. Women who have had multiple pregnancies and vaginal delivery are more likely to develop prolapse.\nOther stresses that can lead to prolapse include constipation with a habit of frequent straining to pass stool, and a chronic cough. Obesity also can strain the pelvic muscles.\nSupport problems in the pelvis become worse after menopause because the pelvic tissues depend on estrogen to help them keep their tone, and estrogen levels drop after menopause.\nSome doctors estimate that half of all women have some degree of uterine or bladder prolapse in the years following childbirth. For most women, these conditions remain undiagnosed and untreated. Only 10% to 20% of women with pelvic prolapse seek medical evaluation for symptoms.\n",
      "Symptoms": "Mild cases of bladder or uterine prolapse usually don't cause any symptoms. A prolapse that is more advanced can cause any of the following symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "An experienced physician usually can diagnose uterine or bladder prolapse with a pelvic examination. Occasionally, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) test may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nIn some cases, especially if you are having recurrent urinary infections or if you are having difficulty holding your urine, your doctor may order one or more tests to evaluate your bladder function.\nUrodynamic studies test your bladder function and can show if your bladder empties completely. The pressure inside your bladder is measured as fluid is passed into it through a small tube. An x-ray video taken after dye is inserted through your urethra to fill your bladder can show whether its shape is distorted. This test is known as a voiding cystourethrogram.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Sometimes you can reverse a mild case of prolapse by doing exercises that strengthen the pelvic muscles. In other cases, the degree and severity of the prolapse can increase over time as the woman ages. This can occur more rapidly in some women than in others.\nAdvanced or severe cases of prolapse usually do not respond to exercise or hormonal therapy. Surgery often improves or cures pelvic organ prolapse.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can take some simple steps to limit stress on the pelvic support system, especially if you have given birth. Limit heavy lifting and avoid unnecessary straining to have bowel movements. Avoid smoking so that you have a lower risk of chronic cough. Maintain a normal body weight through diet and exercise.\nEstrogen supplements after menopause have been credited with helping to maintain strong pelvic muscles and ligaments, but there is no strong evidence that hormone replacement medicine after menopause prevents or treats a bladder or uterine prolapse. There are known health risks associated with hormone replacement. If you are interested in taking hormone replacement medication, you should review the pros and cons of this treatment with your physician.\n",
      "Treatment": "For mild cases, measures to strengthen pelvic floor muscles may be enough to limit symptoms of prolapse. Exercises known as Kegel exercises are an excellent way to increase your pelvic support.\nTo perform Kegel exercises, squeeze the muscles you would use to prevent yourself from passing urine or gas. Hold the contraction for a few seconds, then release. Make sure to completely relax your pelvic floor muscles after the contraction. Repeat 10 times. Try to do four to five sets a day.\nOver time, most women notice improvement in bladder control and may have less pain or fewer symptoms.\nA physician can fit a rubbery, ring-shaped device called a pessary into the upper portion of your vagina. Pessaries can help to prop up the uterus and bladder and prevent them from sagging into the vagina. They are removable so they can be washed periodically.\nA prolapsed bladder or uterus may need to be corrected with surgery, which can be done through the vagina, an incision in the abdomen, or by laparoscopy. The procedure that is chosen depends on the woman's age, severity of the symptoms, medical history, desire for future fertility, and desire to be able to have sex. The goals are to restore normal anatomy, relieve symptoms, restore normal bowel and bladder function, and restore the ability to have sex. In some cases, surgical removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) is recommended.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Prolapse of the pelvic organs is generally a nonthreatening problem. You should contact your physician for an evaluation if you are having bothersome symptoms and you suspect you might have this problem. It is also important to report changes in urinary symptoms to your doctor, since urinary infections are a possible complication of prolapse.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Minor prolapse of the uterus or bladder can be corrected with strengthening exercises of the pelvic floor muscles. Once prolapse has progressed to a more advanced stage, it will continue and worsen without surgical treatment or pessary support.\nMild to moderate prolapse is unlikely to cause significant medical consequences and may not require treatment. Advanced, severe, or complete prolapse usually requires pessary support or surgical treatment to minimize problems with urinary incontinence, urinary retention, vaginal ulceration, sexual dysfunction, or difficulties with having a bowel movement.\n",

      "What is uveitis?": "Uveitis means inflammation of the part of the eye called the uvea. The uvea, also called the uveal tract, is a continuous layer of fibrous tissue that surrounds the eye. It is made up of three structures:\n\nVarious terms are used for the condition, depending on the part of the uvea affected. They include:\nThe most common types of uveitis are anterior uveitis and iridocyclitis. Posterior uveitis is rare.\nMany cases of uveitis are related to an autoimmune disorder (such as ankylosing spondylitis, lupus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, multiple sclerosis or sarcoidosis) or an infection, such as tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, herpes, syphilis or cytomegalovirus (especially in patients with AIDS).\nA number of conditions, including pars planitis, birdshot choroidopathy and sympathetic ophthalmia, are diseases of the eye that may cause uveitis but usually do not affect other parts of the body.\nRarely, uveitis occurs as a side effect of a medication. In up to half of cases, the cause is not known, but recent research has linked certain genes to the development of the disease. One possibility is that some people are prone to uveitis because they have genes that program the immune system to attack the uvea, a process that may be triggered by an infection.\n",
      "Symptoms of uveitis": "Symptoms of uveitis can vary depending on the location of the inflammation. Severe symptoms generally are associated with anterior uveitis, and can include:\n\nIntermediate and posterior uveitis can have more subtle symptoms, including small specks or clouds that move in your field of vision, called floaters, and decreased vision.\n",
      "Diagnosing uveitis": "If your physician suspects you have uveitis, you are likely to be referred to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), who will give you a thorough eye exam, including:\nIn addition, your physician probably will ask you about your medical history, and will examine you. Depending on the results, he or she may order blood tests and X-rays (such as a chest X-ray to look for evidence of sarcoidosis). Because uveitis often is associated with a viral infection or an autoimmune disease, other conditions need to be discovered and treated as well.\n",
      "Expected duration of uveitis": "With treatment, most people with uveitis will improve within days or weeks. However, the condition may last longer, especially if related to an autoimmune disease or untreated infection. Chronic (long-term) forms of the disease can be very difficult to cure and may return. If you have been treated successfully for uveitis, you should expect to have follow-up visits to your doctor every one to six months to make sure that the disease remains stable.\n",
      "Preventing uveitis": "Avoiding medications that may cause uveitis and avoiding certain infections, including syphilis or HIV, may prevent uveitis. For other type of uveitis, there is no known way to prevent the condition.\n",
      "Treating uveitis": "Treatment of uveitis focuses on reducing inflammation and relieving pain. If you have an infection, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics for a bacterial infection, or antiviral medications if due to a virus. For noninfectious uveitis, treatment will usually include prescription eye drops or ointments containing corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. If uveitis affects the iris, eye drops that dilate the pupil also may be prescribed so that the iris won't move and cause pain. Your doctor may recommend sunglasses because bright light may cause discomfort.\nFor more severe cases, your ophthalmologist may recommend injections of corticosteroids into the eye, oral forms of corticosteroids, or additional immunosuppressive medications. Examples of immunosuppressive therapies used in the treatment of uveitis include methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. More recently, options available to treat people with severe uveitis that does not respond to other therapies include adalimumab, infliximab, or steroid implants surgically inserted into the eye.\nAny complications of uveitis, such as glaucoma or cataracts, also will need to be treated. For many patients, a team of physicians will be involved, including a general medical physician, an ophthalmologist, and sometimes other specialists (for example, an infectious disease expert or a rheumatologist).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "See your health care professional if you experience blurred vision, pain in one or both eyes, sensitivity to light, or eye redness.\n",
      "Prognosis": "The outlook varies, depending on the type of uveitis, its severity and duration, whether it responds promptly to treatment and whether there is an associated illness. When diagnosed and treated promptly, the prognosis is generally good, and patients can expect to recover eventually. Left untreated, the complications of uveitis can be serious, and may include glaucoma, cataracts or permanent loss of vision.\n",

      "What is vaginal atrophy?": "Vaginal atrophy is a change of the vagina that develops when there is a significant decrease in levels of the female hormone estrogen. The condition also is called atrophic vaginitis.\nEstrogen, which is produced by the ovaries, plays a vital role in keeping vaginal tissues lubricated and healthy. When levels of estrogen are low, vaginal tissue tends to become atrophic — thin, dry and shrunken. The vagina is then more prone to inflammation in an atrophic state.\nCommon conditions with low estrogen levels that cause vaginal atrophy include:\nVaginal atrophy typically develops so slowly that a woman may not notice any symptoms until five to ten years after menopause begins.\n\n",
      "Symptoms of vaginal atrophy": "Common signs of vaginal atrophy include:\n",
      "Diagnosing vaginal atrophy": "If you are a middle-aged woman, your doctor will ask whether you have started menopause or whether you have been experiencing menopausal symptoms (absent or irregular menstrual periods, mood swings, hot flashes, difficulty sleeping at night, night sweats).\nIf you are a woman of childbearing age, your doctor will inquire whether you are breastfeeding or having irregular menstrual periods, which could be caused by low estrogen levels or by an imbalance in female hormones. Your doctor also will review your medical and surgical history and ask about your current medications.\nThe doctor may suspect vaginal atrophy based on your age, symptoms and medical history. To confirm the diagnosis, the doctor will perform a pelvic examination to examine your vulva and vagina for signs of dryness, redness and thinning of tissue.\nIf you are menopausal and have bleeding after intercourse, your doctor may want to check for endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterine lining) by doing an endometrial biopsy. In this procedure, a small piece of tissue is removed from the uterine lining, and is examined in a laboratory. The doctor also may want to check for a problem with the cervix by doing a Pap test.\n",
      "Expected duration of vaginal atrophy": "The condition will continue until it is treated or estrogen levels return to normal.\n",
      "Preventing vaginal atrophy": "A water-soluble vaginal lubricant can be used to moisten the tissues and prevent painful sexual intercourse. Regular sexual activity also can help to prevent symptoms. This is because sexual intercourse improves blood circulation to the vagina, which helps to maintain vaginal tissue.\n",
      "Treating vaginal atrophy": "Treatments range from over-the-counter moisturizers to prescription-only hormone therapy. Women can often manage mild symptoms with nonhormonal moisturizers and, during sexual intercourse, vaginal lubricants. Sexual activity itself may improve the symptoms. If none of these approaches helps, you may need low-dose estrogen in the form of a cream, tablet, or ring inserted into the vagina. Here's how the various options work:\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Schedule an appointment with your doctor if you experience any vaginal bleeding, vaginal dryness, burning or itching, or if painful sexual intercourse is not relieved with a water-soluble lubricant.\n",
      "Prognosis": "In most people, the outlook is excellent.\n",

      "What is it?": "Normally, vaginal discharge is clear or white. It may become stretchy and slippery during ovulation, about two weeks after your menstrual period. A change in the color or amount of discharge, accompanied by other symptoms, may indicate that you have an infection.\nThe vagina normally contains bacteria. Bacterial growth is controlled and affected by many different factors, such as acid level (pH) and hormones. Anything that upsets this balance may increase your risk of infection or overgrowth of any of the normal bacteria or by yeast. Possible triggers include:\nVaginal discharge may result from infection with:\nSexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea or chlamydia also can cause vaginal discharge. Other possible noninfectious causes include inflammation or irritation of the vagina from a scented product such as soap, douches, pads or tampons; diabetes; or low estrogen levels as in menopause (atrophic vaginitis).\n",
      "Symptoms": "You may notice a change in the color, amount or odor of discharge. A white, curd-like discharge that looks like cottage cheese is a classic sign of yeast infection. Yellow, green or gray discharge is usually a sign of trichomonas or bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis also has an unusual, fishy odor.\nItching is usually most noticeable with a yeast infection, though it may occur with any type of infection or irritation. A dry, irritated vaginal lining, which may be particularly uncomfortable or painful during intercourse, is usually a more prominent symptom of atrophic vaginitis. A new vaginal discharge accompanied by fever, abdominal pain or pain during intercourse may indicate a sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. However, gonorrhea and chlamydia usually don't cause any symptoms at all.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask a variety of questions to help pinpoint the cause of your discharge, including questions about recent antibiotic use, whether you have a new sexual partner, menopausal symptoms, diabetes symptoms and other recent changes in your health or lifestyle.\nYou will then have a pelvic exam. Your doctor will use a device called a speculum to look at the cervix directly. During the pelvic exam, a sample of the discharge is collected for testing. By looking at the discharge under a microscope in the office, your doctor can diagnose yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas infection right away and start treatment. Based on the appearance of the vaginal walls, your doctor may make a diagnosis of atrophic vaginitis.\nYour doctor will check the tenderness of your cervix, uterus or ovaries by placing his or her fingers inside your vagina. Tenderness may indicate that you have a sexually transmitted disease or pelvic inflammatory disease. Diagnosing gonorrhea or chlamydia requires the results of laboratory tests, which may take a few days.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Vaginal discharge from bacterial or yeast infections responds to treatment within a few days to a week. Sexually transmitted diseases should respond to antibiotic treatment within a week. If the infection progresses to a pelvic inflammatory disease beyond the vaginal area, it may take longer to treat.\nAtrophic vaginitis responds best to hormonal therapy with vaginal creams or hormone-replacement therapy by mouth. It usually takes a few weeks to go away. Mild symptoms may be relieved within a few days with vaginal water-based lubricants. If an irritating substance causes your symptoms, identifying and removing the substance should relieve the symptoms within a week.\n",
      "Prevention": "Your doctor can work with you to identify whatever led to your symptoms, such as antibiotic use, wearing non-cotton underwear, wearing tight-fitting undergarments during exercise, using scented products that irritate the vaginal lining, or using birth control pills. If you use birth control pills, you may not need to stop using them to prevent recurrent infection. Changing the type or the strength of the hormone in the pill may be enough to stop symptoms from returning.\nIf you are diabetic, controlling blood sugar levels may help to avoid recurrent infections, especially yeast infections.\n",
      "Treatment": "Infections are treated with antibiotics. Often just one dose of antibiotics by mouth is enough. Another option is to use antibiotics in vaginal cream or gel form, especially if you have significant side effects when you take antibiotics by mouth. Also, the vaginal cream can be more soothing for the inflamed, sore vaginal lining.\nIf you are diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. If your doctor suspects you have a sexually transmitted disease based on your history and physical exam, you may be given antibiotics by injection and by mouth in the office before the tests results can confirm the diagnosis.\nIf you have recurrent yeast infections and recognize the symptoms, you may use over-the-counter antifungal creams without a prescription. If your symptoms do not improve, see your doctor for an exam to confirm the diagnosis and change the treatment.\nAtrophic vaginitis may develop with hormonal changes, most often during or after menopause. The most effective treatment is estrogen. Vaginal estrogen tablets creams or rings are the safest routes because you are exposed to lower estrogen levels compared to taking estrogen by mouth or a skin patch.\nSexual partners do not have to be treated unless you are diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease, or you experience recurrent infections and no other factor is making you prone to infection. If your sexual partner experiences a new discharge or discomfort when urinating or during intercourse, he or she should be evaluated by a doctor.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you had a previous yeast infection, and you have repeat symptoms that are similar, you can start treatment with an over-the-counter antifungal medication. If your symptoms don't improve, make an appointment to see your doctor. See your doctor regarding any new discharge that does not improve when you stop using potential irritants. If you develop abdominal pain or a fever with a new vaginal discharge, you should see a doctor the same day.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Usually, the conditions that cause vaginal discharge respond to treatment within a few days. Atrophic vaginitis may take a few weeks to respond to hormone treatment because the vaginal layer takes time to strengthen. Occasionally, infections come back. Your doctor may determine a more effective course of treatment, suggest ways to self-treat at home or help you eliminate potential causes of infection.\n",

      "What is it?": "Vaginal yeast infections, also called \"Candida vaginal infections,\" typically are caused by the Candida albicans fungus. During a lifetime, 75% of all women are likely to have at least one vaginal Candida infection, and up to 45% have two or more. Women tend to be more likely to get vaginal yeast infections if their bodies are under stress from poor diet, lack of sleep, illness, or when they are pregnant or taking antibiotics. Women with diabetes or immune-suppressing diseases such as HIV infection also are at increased risk.\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection include:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will suspect an infection based on your symptoms. Your doctor will do a pelvic examination to look for inflammation and a white discharge in your vagina and around the vaginal opening. Your doctor may also take a sample of the vaginal discharge for quick examination under a microscope in the office.\n\n",
      "Expected duration": "Proper treatment cures up to 90% of vaginal yeast infections within 2 weeks or less, often within a few days. A small number of people will have repeat infections. Usually, these will improve with repeated treatment. However, patients with unexplained, repeat episodes should be tested for diabetes or HIV – 2 conditions that increase the risk of Candida vaginitis.\n",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent vaginal yeast infections, you can try the following suggestions:\n",
      "Treatment": "The simplest and most convenient treatment of a vaginal Candida infection is a single dose of oral fluconazole (Diflucan Oral, generic versions). It should not be used in pregnant women.\nVaginal yeast infections also can be treated with over-the-counter or prescription antifungal medicines that are inserted directly into the vagina as tablets, creams, ointments or suppositories. These medications include butoconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, tioconazole and terconazole.\nTreatment of sex partners is not usually necessary, since most vaginal yeast infections are not transmitted sexually. However, if a male sex partner shows symptoms ofCandida balanitis(redness, irritation and/or itching at the tip of the penis), he may need to be treated with an antifungal cream or ointment.\nAny woman who experiences symptoms of a vaginal infection for the first time should visit a doctor. This is important to be sure that the vaginal discharge and discomfort is caused by yeast and not sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis.\nAbout 5% of women with vaginal yeast infections develop recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), which is defined as 4 or more vaginal yeast infections in a 1-year period. Although RVVC is more common in women who have diabetes or weakened immune systems, most women with RVVC have no underlying medical illness that would predispose them to recurrentCandidainfections.\nMedical experts continue to explore the most effective way to treat RVVC.  One suggested therapy is 10 days of daily oral fluconazole or daily application of a topical agent, followed by one dose of oral fluconazole once per week for six months. An alternative is to use clotrimazole cream twice weekly for six months following the initial 10 day course.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have vaginal discomfort or an abnormal vaginal discharge, especially if you are pregnant.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Medications cure most vaginal yeast infections. About 5% of women develop RVVC and may require further treatment with prolonged antifungal therapy.\n",

      "What is it?": "Vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina. In premenopausal women, infection is the most common cause. After menopause, a low level of estrogen often leads to vaginal atrophy (atrophic vaginitis). Vaginitis also can be the result of an allergic reaction to an irritating chemical, such as a spermicide, douche or bath soap.\nAlmost all infectious vaginitis is caused by one of three infections\n\n\n\n",
      "Symptoms": "Bacterial vaginosis — Bacterial vaginosis causes an abnormal grayish-white vaginal discharge with a foul-smelling vaginal odor.\nCandida vaginitis —Candida vaginitis can cause the following symptoms:\nTrichomonas —In women, Trichomonas organisms can live in the vagina for many years without causing any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they can include:\nSymptoms can be worse during a menstrual period.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Once you describe your symptoms, your doctor will perform a gynecological examination and check your external genitals, vagina and cervix for inflammation and abnormal discharge.\nYour doctor will suspect bacterial vaginosis if there is a grayish-white discharge coating the walls of your vagina.  There may be a fishy odor to this vaginal discharge. Your doctor may measure the acidity of the discharge with a pH test strip. Usually vaginal fluid has a pH of less than 4.6. Bacterial vaginosis often causes a higher pH. Your doctor may take a sample of this fluid to be examined under the microscope.\n\nYour doctor will suspect Candida vaginitis if your vagina is inflamed and you have a white discharge in your vagina and around the vaginal opening. Your doctor may take a sample of the vaginal discharge to be examined in a laboratory under a microscope.\nYour doctor can confirm that you have Trichomonas vaginitis by examining your vaginal discharge under a microscope. Because people with Trichomonas infections are more likely to get other sexually transmitted infections, your doctor also may test you for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and HIV.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Proper treatment cures up to 90% of vaginal infections within two weeks or less (often within a few days), depending on the type of vaginitis. Untreated vaginal infections can last for years, with or without symptoms.\n",
      "Prevention": "BecauseTrichomonasvaginitis is a STD that can be transmitted during sexual activity, you can help to prevent infection by:\nTo help prevent vaginitis, you can:\n",
      "Treatment": "In women who are not pregnant, bacterial vaginosis can be treated with the antibiotic metronidazole in either an oral (Flagyl) or gel (Metro-Gel) form. Clindamycin (Cleocin) is also effective. Because of concerns about the possible effects of these medications on the developing fetus, the medication treatment may be different for pregnant women. Routine treatment of sex partners is not recommended because it does not seem to affect either the outcome of treatment or the chance of getting infected again.\nCandidavaginitis can be treated with antifungal medications that are administered directly into the vagina as tablets, creams, ointments or suppositories. These medications include butoconazole (Femstat), clotrimazole (several brand names), miconazole (Monistat and others), nystatin (several brand names), tioconazole (Gynecare) and terconazole (Terazol). A single dose of oral fluconazole (Diflucan Oral) also may be used. Treatment of sex partners usually is not recommended.\nTrichomonasvaginal infections are treated with metronidazole, which is given orally. To prevent reinfection, all sex partners of an infected person also must be treated forTrichomonas.Metronidazole should not be used by pregnant women during the first trimester.\nIn people who drink alcohol, metronidazole can trigger cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches and flushing. To prevent these problems, do not drink alcohol while taking metronidazole and for at least two days after the pills are finished.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have vaginal discomfort or an abnormal vaginal discharge, especially if you are pregnant.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Medications cure up to 90% of vaginal infections.  If you do not improve with the first treatment, your doctor usually can cure your infection with a longer course of medication, or a different medication. Trichomonas vaginitis that persists despite treatment usually occurs when a woman's sex partner has not been treated. Without treatment, the partner will continue to transmitTrichomonas.\n",

      "What is it?": "Varicose veins occur when veins just below the skin's surface are damaged, become swollen and fill with too much blood.\nVeins are the blood vessels that return blood to the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to the rest of the body,\nVaricose veins most commonly occur in the legs. In about 50% of cases, the condition runs in families, and probably is related to an inherited weakness in the veins' walls or the valves inside veins that keep blood from backing up.\nPregnancy is another common cause of varicose veins. During pregnancy, the volume of blood increases causing veins to expand. Also, occupations that require uninterrupted standing (waitresses and waiters, nurses, mothers with young children) may force leg veins and valves to work against gravity for hours, increasing the risk of pressure-related vein and valve damage. Garters also can increase the risk of varicose veins if their tight elastics slow blood flow in the legs.\nVaricose veins are 2 to 3 times more common in women than men. Obese people are more likely to develop varicose veins.\nVaricose veins can be associated with prior blood clots and damage to the deeper veins in one or both legs, a situation that sometimes can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. When this happens, the veins lose their ability to effectively move blood back to the heart. This can cause significant leg swelling and skin sores or ulcers.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In the legs, varicose veins commonly are found along the inside of the leg, at the ankles and at the back of the calf. The affected veins look blue, swollen or stretched out, kinked or twisted.\nA dull ache in the legsIn some people, varicose veins do not cause any symptoms. However, other people may experience one or more of the following:\nIn more severe cases of chronic venous insufficiency, a slowing of blood flow through the vein can lead to localized skin changes, including dryness, a rash or brownish discoloration and open sores (ulcers). Slow blood flow also can cause a clot to form inside the affected vein. This condition is called thrombosis.\nIn general, symptoms of varicose veins are worse at the end of the day, especially after periods of prolonged standing. Some women also find that their symptoms are more intense during the days before their menstrual periods, and during pregnancy.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and about your family history of varicose veins. He or she also will ask about your lifestyle, especially the number of hours that you spend on your feet. In women, your doctor will ask about your pregnancy history and about the tightness of elastics on the socks or stockings you wear.\nYour doctor can diagnose varicose veins with a simple physical examination. In most cases, no special tests are necessary.\n",
      "Expected duration": "Varicose veins are a long-term problem, but symptoms can come and go. If you are pregnant and experiencing severe problems with varicose veins, your symptoms will improve after delivery. However, your varicose veins probably will not disappear totally, and you can expect symptoms to return during future pregnancies.\n",
      "Prevention": "You can help to prevent varicose veins by maintaining a normal weight and by avoiding situations where you must stand for prolonged periods. Even with these preventive measures, however, you still may develop varicose veins if this condition tends to run in your family.\nIf you already have varicose veins, you can prevent symptom flare-ups by periodically lying down or sitting down with your legs elevated above the level of your chest. Some physicians also recommend that you wear support stockings or more specialized compression stockings when you walk or stand for long periods of time. The stockings prevent blood from pooling in the veins, and prevent strain on the valves and leg swelling.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment for most people with mild symptoms of varicose veins includes:\nFor varicose veins that are close to the skin, dermatologists or vascular surgeons may offer sclerotherapy or laser therapy. Sclerotherapy involves injection of an irritating into the affected vein, causing the vein to scar and shut down. Laser therapy can be effective for the smallest varicose veins.\nPeople with severe venous insufficiency can develop recurrent blood clots and skin ulcers. The traditional surgery is called vein stripping and ligation. In this surgical procedure, the abnormal veins are tied off and pulled out of the body through series of small cuts in the skin. Another surgical procedure, called ambulatory phlebectomy, also removes veins through small skin incisions, but it is less invasive than classic stripping and ligation.\nNewer therapies include endovenous thermal ablation and transilluminated power phlebotomy (a modified form of ambulatory phlebotomy). Endovenous thermal ablation uses laser or high-frequency radio waves to heat the abnormal veins. These newer procedures appear to cause less scarring, with less \"down time.\"\nExternal laser therapy is reserved primarily for cosmetic removal of small, superficial, spider-like veins.\n",
      "Endovenous treatment": "\nAfter the varicose vein has been located with ultrasound, a catheter is inserted into the vein (A) through a small opening in the skin. The catheter delivers either laser or radiofrequency energy to the vein wall, heating it and causing the vein to collapse. The vein closes as the catheter is withdrawn (B).\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor whenever you have pain, swelling, skin ulcers or an unexplained area of bruising on your legs. New leg swelling, especially in just one leg, can be caused by a blood clot, which requires immediate treatment.\nIf you have varicose veins, call your doctor immediately if you develop an ulcer or a painful, black and blue area near a varicose vein or if you cut the skin over a varicose vein and you have trouble controlling the bleeding.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Varicose veins are a long-term problem, but their symptoms often can be controlled with leg elevation and therapeutic stockings.\nSurgical procedures remove varicose veins permanently, but they leave scars, and they cannot prevent new varicose veins from forming.\n",

      "What is it?": "A vascular birthmark is a discoloration of the skin that is caused by blood vessels that don't form correctly. They are present at birth or appear shortly after birth. There are three major types of vascular birthmarks:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Vascular birthmarks are painless and usually don't cause any symptoms other than the skin discoloration.\nA hemangioma may cause other symptoms if its location interferes with a vital organ. For example, a lesion on the neck could press down on the trachea and interfere with breathing, and a hemangioma near the eye or on the ear could limit vision or affect hearing.\nIn rare cases, a port-wine stain is associated with other abnormalities. For example, some children who have a stain around the eyelids also have Sturge-Weber syndrome, a condition that is associated with glaucoma, seizures and other problems.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "A doctor can diagnose these birthmarks by looking at them. When hemangiomas or port-wine stains are located in an area that could affect organs beneath them or near them, the doctor may order additional imaging studies such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n",
      "Expected duration": "Salmon patches usually fade within the first year of life. Hemangiomas can get larger for 6 to 12 months, sometimes rapidly. Then the growth stops and the hemangioma eventually shrinks and disappears. Most hemangiomas disappear by the time children are 9 years old. Sometimes a bit of extra loose skin remains in the spot where the hemangioma disappeared. Port-wine stains usually grow in proportion to the body and persist into adulthood. They may darken or thicken and develop tiny bumps.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent vascular birthmarks.\n",
      "Treatment": "No treatment is necessary for salmon patches, which usually fade within the first year of life. For most hemangiomas, the best cosmetic results are achieved when the birthmarks are allowed to go away naturally, without treatment. However, an infant with a hemangioma should be followed closely to be sure that it is not increasing in size.\nHemangiomas that are enlarging can be treated with propranolol. Those that don't respond to propranolol or pose a danger because of interference with a vital organ are treated with oral or injected corticosteroids, laser or surgical removal. Port-wine stains can be covered with opaque cosmetic creams. They also can be removed by laser therapy.\nYou should discuss treatment options with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon, who has expert experience in treating vascular birthmarks.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Birthmarks should be evaluated by a doctor soon after they appear and at regular intervals after that, particularly to monitor the growth of hemangiomas.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Salmon patches fade and have no associated problems. The majority of hemangiomas eventually disappear with no associated problems, although some people affected are left with minor skin changes. Laser therapy can remove most port-wine stains with minimal scarring or discoloration. For hemangiomas involving vital organs and port-wine stains associated with other abnormalities, the outlook varies. For the best outcome, seek early evaluation and treatment by an experienced doctor.\n",

      "What is it?": "Vasculitis means inflammation of blood vessels. The inflammation can be short term (acute) or long term (chronic), and it can be so severe that it reduces blood flow to tissues and organs. This can cause dangerous organ and tissue damage, especially when vasculitis affects blood vessels in the brain, lungs, kidneys, or other vital areas.\nAlthough the cause of most forms of vasculitis remains unknown, many forms probably are related to a problem with the immune system. One theory is that, for unknown causes, the immune system attacks the blood vessels, which causes them to become inflamed. Some researchers think this immune attack might be triggered by an infection, drug, or something else in the environment.\nThere are many different forms of vasculitis, including:\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary depending on the specific type of vasculitis:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and will examine you. This may be followed by\n",
      "Expected duration": "How long vasculitis lasts depends on the type. For example, most cases of cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis or Kawasaki disease go away on their own over a period of days or weeks. Granulomatosis with polyangiitismay respond to treatment at first, but many patients relapse and require treatment again. Giant cell arteritis typically requires therapy for a year or more.\n",
      "Prevention": "There is no way to prevent most forms of vasculitis. If a medication caused vasculitis, you may be able to prevent another case of vasculitis by avoiding that drug.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment varies by type of vasculitis:\nThere are a number of other types of vasculitis; they tend to be treated with immune-suppressing medications as described above.\n",

      "What is vertigo?": "Vertigo is the sensation that either your body or your environment is moving (usually spinning). Vertigo can be a symptom of many different illnesses and disorders. The most common causes of vertigo are illnesses that affect the inner ear, including:\n",
      "Symptoms of vertigo": "Vertigo can feel like the room is spinning or like you are spinning in the room, or it can be just a sense of imbalance. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting and ringing in one or both ears (tinnitus).\n",
      "Diagnosing vertigo": "Your doctor will diagnose vertigo based on your description of what you are feeling. Vertigo can be divided into two major categories, peripheral vertigo and central vertigo.\nPeripheral vertigo, which is much more common, includes benign positional vertigo, labyrinthitis and M'nière's disease. Positional vertigo is diagnosed when moving the head causes the vertigo and returning the head to a neutral position relieves symptoms. Labyrinthitis and M'nière's attacks usually come on abruptly and last from a few hours to a couple of days. There may be intense nausea and vomiting and variable hearing loss.\nCentral vertigo is a more serious problem in the cerebellum (back part of the brain) or brain stem.\nYour doctor will evaluate your eye to look for abnormal jerking movements (nystagmus). The pattern of your eye movements may help to determine if the problem is peripheral or central. Usually, no further testing is needed unless your doctor suspects you have central vertigo. If central vertigo is suspected, your doctor will order a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain.\n",
      "Expected duration of vertigo": "Depending on its cause, vertigo may last only a few seconds or last for weeks or months.\n",
      "Preventing vertigo": "Vertigo can happen to anyone, and there is no way to prevent the first episode. Because vertigo can be associated with an intense sense of imbalance, it is important to avoid situations in which a fall could cause significant harm, like climbing a ladder or working on a slanted roof.\n",
      "Treating vertigo": "Your doctor may begin treatment by recommending bed rest or prescribing medications that suppress the activity of the inner ear, such as meclizine (Antivert, Bonine and other brand names), dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) or promethazine (Phenergan); anticholinergic medications such as scopolamine (Transderm-Sco); or a tranquilizer, such as diazepam (Valium). Depending on the cause and duration of the vertigo, additional advice may be offered.\nFor benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, your doctor may move your head and body through a series of positions. This is done in the office, usually on the examining table. The maneuvers move the tiny free floating crystals out of the sensing tube. The most commonly used method is the Epley maneuver. Your doctor also may provide specific maneuvers for you to continue at home.\nFor more persistent vertigo, your doctor may recommend other types of vestibular rehabilitation, also called balance rehabilitation. The types of exercises prescribed depend upon the underlying cause of dizziness and what movements provoke the symptoms. Your doctor may refer you to an audiologist and/or a physical therapist to help design and instruct your therapy.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor if you have a new episode of vertigo, especially if it is associated with headache and significant coordination problems. Also call if you have mild vertigo that persists after a couple days.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Most cases of vertigo last a few hours to a few days. Symptoms caused by acute labyrinthitis almost always go away without permanent injury. Other causes of vertigo may result in symptoms that are more persistent.\n",

      "What is it?": "Vitamin B12is needed to produce an adequate amount of healthy red blood cells in the bone marrow. Vitamin B12is available only in animal foods (meat and dairy products) or yeast extracts (such as brewer's yeast). Vitamin B12deficiency is defined by low levels of stored B12in the body that can result in anemia, a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells.\nVitamin B12deficiency can develop for the following reasons:\n\nIn children, decreased levels of intrinsic factor can be an inherited (genetic) condition. When this happens, low levels of intrinsic factor produce symptoms of juvenile pernicious anemia in patients younger than age 10.Pernicious anemia occurs more commonly in people who already have diseases that are linked to immune-system abnormalities, such as Graves' disease, hypothyroidism (under-functioning thyroid gland), thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid), vitiligo and Addison's disease (adrenocortical insufficiency).\n",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms tend to develop slowly and may not be recognized immediately. As the condition worsens, common symptoms include:\nIf low levels of B12remain for a long time, the condition also can lead to irreversible damage to nerve cells, which can cause the following symptoms:\n",
      "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will ask you about your diet and about any family history of anemia. Your doctor also will review your medical history for medical illnesses (diabetes, immune disorders) or surgeries, such as stomach removal, that can lead to B12deficiency.\nYour doctor may suspect that you have vitamin B12deficiency based on your medical history and symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis, he or she will examine you and order laboratory tests. During the physical examination, your doctor will look for a red, beefy tongue, pale or yellowish skin, a rapid pulse and heart murmurs resulting from an anemia-related increase in blood flow demands on the heart. Laboratory tests will include:\n",
      "Expected duration": "With proper treatment, symptoms of vitamin B12deficiency begin to improve within a few days. In vegans and other people whose B12deficiency is diet-related, oral B12supplements and a diet designed to increase consumption of vitamin B12should cure the condition. People with pernicious anemia or people who cannot absorb vitamin B12from their intestines will need injections of vitamin B12 every one to three months indefinitely.\n",
      "Prevention": "To prevent vitamin B12deficiency, vegans should take adequate amounts of vitamin B12supplements to make up for the shortage in their diet.\nFor people who cannot absorb B12, the condition cannot be prevented. However, once it is diagnosed, regular injections of vitamin B12will prevent symptoms from returning.\n",
      "Treatment": "Treatment for this condition involves replacing the missing vitamin B12. People who cannot absorb B12need regular injections. When injections first are administered, a patient with severe symptoms may receive five to seven during the first week to restore the body's reserves of this nutrient. A response usually is seen within 48 to 72 hours, with brisk production of new red blood cells. Once B12reserves reach normal levels, injections of vitamin B12will be needed every one to three months to prevent symptoms from returning. People who cannot absorb vitamin B12should continue to eat a well-balanced diet that provides other nutrients (folic acid, iron and vitamin C) necessary to produce healthy blood cells. Sometimes people can take high doses of oral B12to provide replacement instead of undergoing injections, but a physician should closely supervise this.\nIn people whose vitamin B12deficiency is related to overgrowth of intestinal bacteria, treatment with oral antibiotics, such as tetracycline (sold under several brand names), may stop bacterial overgrowth and allow the absorption of vitamin B12to return to normal.\nVitamin B12deficiency resulting from inadequate dietary intake is the easiest to treat. The condition can be reversed by taking oral vitamin B12supplements and adding foods containing B12.\nWhen the anemia is severe and the red blood cell count is extremely low, blood transfusions may be necessary for the first couple of days until the vitamin B12injections begin working.\n",

      "What is vitiligo?": "Vitiligo consists of white patches of skin that are caused by the loss of melanin, the pigment that is a major contributor to skin color. Melanin is produced by special cells called melanocytes, which are destroyed in people who have vitiligo. The cause of vitiligo is not known, but evidence strongly suggests that vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder, in which the body's immune system mistakenly targets and injures melanocytes.\n\nVitiligo can cause minor changes or extensive changes in the skin. In some people it may be hardly noticeable, while in others it is obvious. In dark-skinned people the vitiligo patches tend to be more obvious since they contrast with normal skin. Light-skinned people may have fewer cosmetic concerns, but patches without pigment can become obvious in the summer because unaffected skin tans while vitiligo skin does not tan.\nVitiligo occurs in about 1% to 2% of the population. Approximately 30% of people with vitiligo have a family history of the condition. About half of people with vitiligo start showing symptoms before age 20.\nPeople with vitiligo have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes. Also, people with these conditions have an increased risk of developing vitiligo.\n",
      "Symptoms of vitiligo": "Vitiligo causes patches of white skin that are often symmetrical (even), with dark or red borders. The patches can occur anywhere, but the areas most commonly affected are the backs of the hands, the face, and areas that have skin folds, such as the armpits and genitals. Body openings such as the lips, eyes, nipples, and anus are also common areas for vitiligo, as are areas that have been sunburned.\nVitiligo can occur in bursts, so that sizeable areas of skin may rapidly lose their pigment during the beginning stages of the condition, yet then these whitened skin patches may abruptly stop expanding for months or years.\n",
      "Diagnosing vitiligo": "Vitiligo causes a pattern of skin changes that usually can be recognized easily by a doctor. If the skin changes are in a pattern that suggests other conditions, your doctor might recommend a biopsy of the skin to be certain about your diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed and examined in a laboratory. A biopsy usually is not needed to diagnose vitiligo.\n",
      "Expected duration of vitiligo": "In one out of every five to 10 people with vitiligo, some or all of the pigment eventually returns on its own and the white patches disappear. For most people, however, the whitened skin patches last and grow larger if vitiligo is not treated. Vitiligo is a lifelong condition.\n",
      "Preventing vitiligo": "There is no way to prevent vitiligo.\n",
      "Treating vitiligo": "Vitiligo is difficult to treat, and responses vary. The most important treatment is to protect areas of vitiligo from the sun. It is very easy for areas without pigment to become sunburned. This increases the risk of skin cancer. Wear sun-protective clothing and/or apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 to areas affected by vitiligo.\nOther treatments can be attempted if vitiligo causes emotional or social distress. The goals of treatment are to minimize the contrast in color between your normal skin and skin patches that have lost pigment.\nFor many, \"cosmetic camouflage\" may be the best option. Spray tanning products and foundation-based cosmetics are often recommended when vitiligo affects skin in highly visible areas such as the hands, face, or neck.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "If you notice that patches of skin appear white, contact your doctor for an examination. Treatment may be most helpful if it can be started when only a small area of skin is affected. It is very important to wear sunscreen to protect the areas affected by vitiligo, since these areas are especially at risk for sunburn and for skin cancers.\n",
      "Prognosis": "For most people with vitiligo, this condition slowly worsens without treatment or needs continued treatment.\n",

      "What is a vocal cord disorder?": "The vocal cords are two bands of elastic muscle tissue. They are located side by side and together they make up the voice box (larynx) just above the windpipe (trachea). Like other tissues in the body, vocal cords can be strained and damaged. Vocal cords can also impacted by infections, tumors and trauma.\nWhen you are silent, the cords remain open and create an airway through which you breathe.\nWhen you speak, the air you exhale from your lungs is forced through the closed vocal cords. This causes them to vibrate. When they vibrate, they produce sound that we use for speech and communication. They vibrate faster for higher-pitched sounds, slower for lower-pitched sounds.\nStrained vocal cords generally aren't noticed until the problem becomes severe. People who use their voices for a living or who shout or scream frequently are at particular risk. People who work in noisy environments that require shouting to communicate are also at risk.\nCommon vocal cord disorders include:\nLaryngitis can be caused by:\nVocal cord paresis and paralysis can have several causes, including:\nParesis also can result from weakened vocal cord muscles. Vocal cord muscles can be weakened temporarily as a side effect of inhaled corticosteroid medicine sprays. They may also weaken after extended treatment with an artificial respirator (ventilator) in a hospital.\n",
      "Symptoms of vocal cord disorder": "Many vocal cord disorders result in hoarseness or voice changes. Symptoms can vary, depending on the vocal cord disorder.\nIf you experience pain or difficulty breathing, this may indicate a condition that requires more urgent medical attention.\n",
      "Diagnosing vocal cord disorder": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history. The doctor will listen to the quality of your voice and then inspect your vocal cords. This is usually done by using a small, flexible lighted tube with a camera at the end. The tube is inserted through the nose to the larynx.\nYou will need to make certain sounds so your doctor can see your vocal cords in action. The examination may be videotaped so your doctor can analyze it later. This is all that is needed to diagnose most cases of laryngitis, vocal cord nodules and polyps.\nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend an acoustic analysis. This is a series of tests that measure the quality of your voice including its pitch stability, range, and intensity. Often, these tests are used when vocal cords are paralyzed or if a growth must be removed surgically. Using the test results, doctors and voice therapists can judge the amount of improvement after treatment.\nCancer of the larynx can look similar to a noncancerous growth or a contact ulcer. If an abnormality is found on the vocal cords, your doctor may require a biopsy. A biopsy involves removing a tiny sample of the affected vocal cord tissue so it can be examined in a laboratory.\nAdditional tests, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or MRI, may be required in some cases.\n",
      "Expected duration of vocal cord disorder": "",
      "Preventing vocal cord disorder": "To help prevent disorders caused by vocal overuse (including laryngitis, vocal cord nodes, and polyps, and contact ulcers), you need to learn how to talk without straining your vocal cords. A voice therapist can teach you how to do this. Look for a licensed and certified speech-language pathologist who specializes in voice.\nTo prevent disorders related to acid reflux (including contact ulcers and laryngitis), see your doctor to treat the reflux. Medications can help to control stomach acid. Lifestyle changes also help some people. Changes include:\nTo help prevent vocal cord disorders caused by irritation (including laryngitis and vocal cord polyps), avoid smoking, drinking, or inhaling chemical irritants. Smoking and excess alcohol use are risk factors for vocal cord cancers. Prevention of these cancers requires stopping smoking and limiting alcohol consumption.\nIf you use an inhaled corticosteroid medicine to treat asthma or other lung disease, you may be able to prevent vocal cord muscle weakness. Use a spacer device that catches large medicine droplets too heavy to be carried deep into your lung airways. These large droplets can otherwise settle in your throat and trachea, where they can cause side effects.\nIf you have viral laryngitis, cover your mouth when coughing and wash your hands often to prevent others from getting your infection.\n",
      "Treating vocal cord disorder": "For vocal cord disorders resulting from vocal cord overuse, there are two main treatments:\nIf rest and therapy don't resolve the disorder, other treatments are available. They are based on the type of disorder:\nTreating cancerous tumors depends on the extent of the cancer. Biopsy will be required to make the diagnosis. But after surgical biopsy, radiation and chemotherapy are potentially available. Some voice will remain after these procedures.\nIn later stages of cancer, the entire larynx, including the vocal cords, must be removed (laryngectomy). You will need to learn a new speech method, using a special valve inserted surgically between the trachea and the esophagus. This allows air to be sent up the esophagus, creating enough vibrations for understandable speech.\nIf improvement is not satisfactory, surgery may be recommended to change the position of the affected vocal cord. Surgery can also add bulk by injecting the vocal cord with collagen, body fat, or some other substance.\nThese types of procedures are recommended more often when one of the vocal cords is paralyzed. Both techniques bring the paralyzed cord closer to the cord that is not paralyzed. This allows the cords to vibrate enough to make sounds.\nFor people with two paralyzed vocal cords, the goal of treatment is to improve breathing. The most common procedure is a tracheotomy. This procedure creates a hole in the neck below the level of the vocal cords. A breathing tube is placed into the hole.\n",

      "What Is It?": "Warts are small skin growths caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), which infects the top layer of skin. There are more than 40 different types of HPV. The wart virus can be transmitted from one person to another either by direct contact, or indirectly when both people come in contact with a surface, such as a floor or desk.\nPeople may come into contact with HPV by walking barefoot in public places, such as gyms and shower floors or by sexual contact. HPV also can be transmitted in the same person from one spot on the body to another. It is easier for HPV to infect a person when the person's skin is scratched or cut.\nWarts can appear at any age but are more common in older children and are uncommon in the elderly. A wart's appearance varies with its location and the type of virus that has caused it. For example, flat warts commonly appear on the face, neck, chest, forearms and legs. Most warts go away after a year or two, but some last for years or come back after going away.\nWarts can itch or bleed. When warts are located in areas that are rubbed against clothing or bumped frequently, they can become irritated and the skin around them can become painful.\n",
      "Symptoms": "The two types of warts seen most often are common warts and plantar warts.\n\nPlantar wartsappear on the bottom (sole) of the foot. They are flattened by the pressure of standing on them and can be dotted with tiny, clotted blood vessels that look like dark pinpoints. Plantar warts often are painful, especially when they're on a weight-bearing part of the foot. Plantar warts may require vigorous, repeated treatment before they go away.\n\nOther types of warts include:\nGenital wartsappear on and near the genitals of men and women, as well as inside the vagina and on the cervix in women.\nCervical wartsappear on the cervix and sometimes develop into cervical cancer.\nMosaic wartsappear on the feet. They are groups of many small, closely set plantar warts.\nFiliform wartsappear on the eyelids, face, neck or lips. They are long, narrow growths that usually grow straight out from the skin.\nFlat wartsappear on the face and along scratch marks. They are smooth, flat-topped, yellow-brown papules and are more common in children than in adults.\nPedunculated wartsappear on the head and neck, scalp and beard and are shaped like cauliflower.\nDiagnosis\nA doctor usually can diagnose warts by looking at them. Sometimes, the doctor will have to take some tissue from a wart and analyze it under a microscope. An HPV test can also be performed on samples taken from the cervix during a woman's pelvic exam.\n",
      "Expected Duration": "Even without treatment, warts may disappear in months or years on their own. However, there is always a chance they will come back.\n",
      "Prevention": "It is difficult to prevent all warts. You can reduce your chances of getting warts by avoiding skin contact with existing warts and with contaminated floors, such as those in locker rooms and around swimming pools. Vaccination, abstinence or safe sex techniques (such as condom use) can reduce the risk of genital warts.\nThe vaccine for HPV can prevent infection with the most common viral strains responsible for genital warts; by preventing these infections, the vaccine can also reduce the risk of cancers, including cervical, anal and penile cancers, that complicate chronic infection with these viruses. Vaccination is recommended for 11 to 12 year-old boys and girls; vaccination earlier (at age 9) or later (age 13-26 for females, 13 to 21 for males) may be recommended in some cases.\n",
      "Treatment": "Most warts disappear within a year or two, even if they are not treated; however, without treatment warts may spread. Many people choose to have warts treated either because of minor pain or for cosmetic reasons. Treatment depends on the location of the wart, its type and size, a person's age and health, and his or her willingness to follow through with repeated treatments.  Genital warts should be treated and monitored in order to detect or prevent related cancers.\nOver-the-counter liquids and patches containing salicylic acid can decrease the size of a wart, but they should not be used on the face or genitals. Your doctor may treat a wart by applying certain medications or acids, freezing it (cryotherapy) or surgically removing it.\n",
      "When To Call a Professional": "If you think you might have a wart, you should show it to your doctor at your next visit to make sure it is a wart and to discuss treatment.\nSeek help if your wart causes pain, bleeds easily, spreads easily to other areas of the body or comes back, or if you want the wart removed for cosmetic reasons. You also should see your doctor if you develop genital warts, so they can be treated.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Warts usually disappear within a year or two and are little more than an inconvenience. But because they shed virus particles into the surrounding area, they are contagious and can cause new warts to appear nearby. In some people, warts may be a more chronic (long-lasting) problem. These people may have individual warts that won't go away or they keep getting new warts. Warts that continue to persist or grow despite treatment should be examined by your doctor since some skin cancers can masquerade as warts.\n",

      "What is it?": "A sprain in the wrist is an injury to its ligaments, the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to one another inside a joint. Although most people speak of the wrist as a single joint between the forearm and hand, the wrist actually contains many joints that link 15 separate bones. The ligaments that connect these bones can be torn by any extreme twist, bend, or impact that suddenly forces the wrist into a position beyond its normal range of motion.\nThere are three levels of sprain:\nSprains of the wrist are fairly rare in everyday life and in the workplace. Under certain weather conditions, such as during ice storms or after a snowfall, a wrist sprain is commonly caused by a fall in which a person lands on an outstretched arm.\nFor athletes, sprains and other injuries to the wrist or hand account for 3% to 9% of all sports injuries. They are especially common among athletes who play football, basketball, or baseball. In addition, at least 36 Olympic events have been linked to an unusually high rate of wrist sprains, including roller hockey, baseball, boxing, basketball, volleyball, weightlifting, ice hockey, wrestling, and judo.\nAmong skiers, wrist sprains commonly occur when the skier falls while still gripping a ski pole or still having the pole strapped to the hand. Falls are also a frequent cause of wrist sprains and fractures among snowboarders and inline skaters. In platform divers, wrist sprains can occur when the wrist absorbs an unusually forceful impact as the athlete hits the water. Wrists sprains also occur in racquet sports, wrestling, and pole vaulting because the wrist is subjected to extreme twisting movements during these sports.\n",
      "Symptoms": "In a mild wrist sprain, your wrist may be slightly swollen and tender, and you probably will feel some mild pain when you move it.\nIn more severe sprains, swelling can change the shape of your wrist, and you may have some bruising (a black-and-blue skin discoloration). Also, you'll probably feel significant pain when you try to move your wrist, or when your health care professional moves your wrist while examining it.\n",
      "Diagnosis": "After reviewing your symptoms, your doctor will ask you to describe how you injured your wrist. Include as many details as you can. Did you fall or twist the wrist? What position was your wrist in when you injured it? If you are an athlete, your doctor may want an eyewitness account of your injury. Your doctor also will review your medical history, especially any history of previous wrist, hand or forearm injuries.\nIf the results of your history and physical suggest you have a severe wrist sprain or a fractured bone, your doctor may order wrist x-rays. If these appear normal but your symptoms are severe and persistent, your doctor may order additional tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan. In some people, especially in competitive athletes with moderate or severe wrist injuries, the doctor may do a type of minor operation called arthroscopy to inspect the wrist ligaments directly for signs of damage.\n",
      "Expected duration": "In milder wrist sprains, symptoms usually improve within two to three days. More severe sprains can take a number of weeks or even months to heal completely.\n",
      "Prevention": "To prevent wrist sprains related to falls, you can stay indoors when it's icy or wet outside. If you must go out, wear shoes with soles that provide traction during slippery conditions and pay careful attention to the surface where you are walking.\nTo prevent sports-related wrist sprains, wear protective equipment that supports the wrist. In particular, snowboarders and inline skaters should protect their wrists by using wrist guards or snug-fitting plastic wrist splints. Platform divers may wear protective tape, wrist splints, or wraps that limit extension of the wrist.\nTo prevent wrist sprains related to skiing, choose ski poles that have a low-profile grip with finger grooves. Also, grip ski poles without using straps and drop poles during a fall.\n",
      "Treatment": "For milder wrist sprains, initial treatment follows theRICErule:\nYour doctor also may suggest a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) to relieve pain and ease swelling.\nFor moderate wrist sprains, especially in professional or competitive athletes, the wrist may be immobilized in a splint or light cast for seven to 10 days. If you have a significant wrist injury, you will need physical therapy as soon as symptoms allow. Athletes usually can return to competition once symptoms subside, although it may be advisable to protect the injured wrist with a support splint. When a severe wrist sprain causes significant instability in the wrist, surgery may be required.\n",
      "When to call a professional": "Call your doctor immediately whenever you have symptoms of a severely sprained wrist, especially if your wrist is deformed or severely swollen, or if pain prevents you from moving your wrist normally in any direction. For milder sprains, call your doctor if your wrist symptoms do not improve within two to three days after your injury.\n",
      "Prognosis": "Since most wrist sprains heal with time, the long-term outlook is usually excellent. This is especially true for people who do not routinely play sports that twist or bend the wrist. Among athletes with severe sprains, arthroscopic repair is usually successful.\n",
