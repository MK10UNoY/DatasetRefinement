If a clot forms in your leg, a portion of it can break off and travel to one or both of your lungs, where it can block blood flow. This is called a pulmonary embolism.",
      "Collapsed lung, also called pneumothorax.In most people with ARDS, a breathing machine called a ventilator brings more oxygen into the body and forces fluid out of the lungs. But the pressure and air volume of the ventilator can force gas to go through a small hole in the very outside of a lung and cause that lung to collapse.",
      "Infections.A ventilator attaches to a tube inserted in your windpipe. This makes it much easier for germs to infect and injure your lungs.",
      "Scarred and damaged lungs, known as pulmonary fibrosis.Scarring and thickening of the tissue between the air sacs in the lungs can occur within a few weeks of the start of ARDS. This makes your lungs stiffer, and it's even harder for oxygen to flow from the air sacs into your bloodstream.",
      "Stress ulcers.Extra acid that your stomach makes because of serious illness or injury can irritate the stomach lining and lead to ulcers.",
      "Thanks to better treatments, more people are surviving ARDS. But many survivors end up with potentially serious and sometimes lasting effects:",
      "Breathing problems.After having ARDS, many people get most of their lung function back within several months to several years, but others may have breathing problems for the rest of their lives.

      "The heart has four chambers:",
      "The two upper chambers are called the atria.",
      "The two lower chambers are called the ventricles.",
      "Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat.",
      "The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called theAVnode, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers.",
      "In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute.",
      "But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. TheAVnode is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm.",
      "In people withAFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.",
      "If you have chest pain, seek immediate medical help. Chest pain could mean that you're having a heart attack."

      "Age.The risk ofAFibincreases as you grow older.",
      "Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use.Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs — such as amphetamines and cocaine — can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias.",
      "Drinking too much alcohol.Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.",
      "Changes in the level of body minerals.Minerals in the blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium — help the heart beat. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur.",
      "Family history.An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families.",
      "Heart problems or heart surgery.Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk ofAFib. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition.",
      "High blood pressure.Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart.",
      "Obesity.People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.",
      "Other long-term health conditions.You may be more likely to getAFibif you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea.",
      "Some medicines and supplements.Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats.",

      "Symptoms of a brain AVM may begin at any age but usually appear between ages 10 and 40. Brain AVMs can damage brain tissue over time. The effects slowly build and often cause symptoms in early adulthood.",
      "By middle age, however, brain AVMs tend to remain stable and are less likely to cause symptoms."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "The cause of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is not known. Researchers believe most brain AVMs are present at birth and form during a baby's growth in the womb. But brain AVMs can happen later in life as well.",
      "Brain AVMs are seen in some people who have hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT also is known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. HHT affects the way blood vessels form in several areas of the body, including the brain.",
      "Typically, the heart sends oxygen-rich blood to the brain through arteries. The arteries slow blood flow by passing the blood through a series of smaller and smaller blood vessels. The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries. The capillaries slowly deliver oxygen through their thin, porous walls to the surrounding brain tissue.",
      "The oxygen-depleted blood passes into small blood vessels and then into larger veins. The veins return the blood to the heart and lungs to get more oxygen.",
      "The arteries and veins in an AVM lack this supporting network of smaller blood vessels and capillaries. Instead, blood flows quickly and directly from the arteries to the veins. When this happens, surrounding brain tissue doesn't receive the oxygen it needs."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Get medical care right away if you notice any symptoms of a brain AVM, such as seizures, headaches or other symptoms. A bleeding brain AVM is dangerous and requires emergency medical care."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Anyone can be born with a brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM), but these factors may raise the risk:",
      "Being male.Brain AVMs are more common in men.",
      "Having a family history.Rarely, brain AVMs occur in families, but it's not clear if there's a certain genetic risk factor. It's also possible to inherit other medical conditions that increase the risk of brain AVMs, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Complications of a brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) include:",
      "Bleeding in the brain.A brain AVM puts extreme pressure on the walls of the affected arteries and veins. The pressure causes the arteries and veins to become thin or weak. This may result in the AVM breaking open and bleeding into the brain, known as a hemorrhage.This risk of a brain AVM bleeding ranges from around 2% to 3% each year. The risk of bleeding may be higher for certain types of AVM. Risk also may be higher in people who have had a brain AVM bleed in the past.Although studies haven't found that pregnancy increases the risk of hemorrhage in people with a brain AVM, more research is needed.Some hemorrhages associated with brain AVMs aren't detected because they cause no major symptoms. However, potentially dangerous bleeding can occur.Brain AVMs account for about 2% of all hemorrhagic strokes each year. In children and young adults who experience brain hemorrhage, brain AVMs are often the cause.",
      "Reduced oxygen to brain tissue.With a brain AVM, blood doesn't flow through the network of small blood vessels called capillaries. Instead, it flows directly from arteries to veins. Blood rushes quickly because it isn't slowed by the smaller blood vessels.Surrounding brain tissue can't easily absorb oxygen from the fast-flowing blood. Without enough oxygen, brain tissues weaken or may die off completely. This results in stroke-like symptoms, such as trouble speaking, weakness, numbness, vision loss or trouble staying steady.",
      "Thin or weak blood vessels.An AVM puts extreme pressure on the thin and weak walls of the blood vessels. A bulge in a blood vessel wall, known as an aneurysm, may form. The aneurysm may be at risk of bursting.",
      "Brain damage.The body may use more arteries to supply blood to the fast-flowing brain AVM. As a result, some AVMs may get bigger and displace or compress portions of the brain. This may prevent protective fluids from flowing freely around the brain.If fluid builds up, it can push brain tissue against the skull.",
      "One type of brain AVM that involves a major blood vessel called the vein of Galen causes serious complications in babies. Symptoms are present at birth or appear soon after birth. This type of brain AVM causes fluid to build up in the brain and the head to swell. Swollen veins may be seen on the scalp, and seizures may occur. Children with this type of brain AVM can have a failure to thrive and congestive heart failure."

The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. The cells continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. This causes too many cells. The cells might form a mass called a tumor. The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body.",

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Chiari malformation type 1 occurs when part of the skull is too small or is misshapen. This part of the skull contains the area of the brain called the cerebellum. The skull puts pressure on and crowds the brain. As a result, the lower part of the cerebellum known as the tonsils are pushed into the upper spinal canal.",
      "Chiari malformation type 2 is nearly always associated with a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele.",

      "Spina bifida.Spina bifida is a condition in which the spinal cord or its covering isn't fully developed. Part of the spinal cord is exposed, which can cause serious conditions such as paralysis. People with Chiari malformation type 2 usually have a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele.",
      "Syringomyelia.Some people with Chiari malformation also develop a condition called syringomyelia. In people with this condition, a cavity or cyst called a syrinx forms within the spinal column. As the syrinx grows, it can press on the nerves and cause pain, weakness and stiffness.",

      "Later in life, hip dysplasia can damage the soft cartilage, called the labrum, that rims the socket portion of the hip joint. This is called a hip labral tear. Hip dysplasia can also make the joint more likely to develop osteoarthritis. This happens because of higher contact pressures over a smaller surface of the socket. Over time, this wears away the smooth cartilage on the bones that helps them glide against each other as the joint moves."

    "Symptoms": [
      "Symptoms vary by age group. In infants, you might notice that one leg is longer than the other. Once a child begins walking, a limp may develop. During diaper changes, one hip may be less flexible than the other.",
      "In teenagers and young adults, hip dysplasia can cause painful complications such as osteoarthritis or a hip labral tear. This may cause activity-related groin pain. Sometimes, there might be a sensation of instability in the hip."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "At birth, the hip joint is made of soft cartilage that gradually hardens into bone. The ball and socket need to fit together well because they act as molds for each other. If the ball isn't seated firmly into the socket, the socket will not fully form around the ball and will become too shallow.",
      "During the final month before birth, the space within the womb can become so crowded that the ball of the hip joint moves out of its proper position. This results in a shallower socket. Factors that may reduce the amount of space in the womb include:",
      "First pregnancy.",
      "Large baby.",
      "Breech presentation."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Hip dysplasia tends to run in families and is more common in girls. The risk of hip dysplasia is also higher in babies born in the breech position and in babies who are swaddled tightly with the hips and knees straight."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Later in life, hip dysplasia can damage the soft cartilage, called the labrum, that rims the socket portion of the hip joint. This is called a hip labral tear. Hip dysplasia can also make the joint more likely to develop osteoarthritis. This happens because of higher contact pressures over a smaller surface of the socket. Over time, this wears away the smooth cartilage on the bones that helps them glide against each other as the joint moves."

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Seeing colors across the light spectrum is a complex process that begins with your eyes' ability to respond to different wavelengths of light.",
      "Light, which contains all color wavelengths, enters your eye through the cornea and passes through the lens and transparent, jellylike tissue in your eye (vitreous humor) to wavelength-sensitive cells (cones) at the back of your eye in the macular area of the retina. The cones are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green) or long (red) wavelengths of light. Chemicals in the cones trigger a reaction and send the wavelength information through your optic nerve to your brain.",

      "Diseases.Some conditions that can increase the risk of color deficiency include sickle cell anemia, diabetes, macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Parkinson's disease, chronic alcoholism and leukemia. One eye may be more affected than the other, and the color deficiency may get better if the underlying disease can be treated.",
      "Certain medicines.Some medicines can affect color vision, such as hydrochloroquine, a medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.",

People with narcolepsy feel less alert and focused during the day. They also fall asleep without warning. Sleep can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again.",
      "Automatic behaviors.Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, they may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. They might continue to perform that task while asleep. After waking, they can't remember what they did, and they probably didn't do it well.",
      "Sudden loss of muscle tone.This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles for up to a few minutes. It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms.",
      "Sleep paralysis.People with narcolepsy may experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, the person can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. The paralysis is usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy.",
      "Hallucinations.Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming.",
      "Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "The exact cause of narcolepsy is not known. People with type 1 narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin (hi-poe-KREE-tin), also called orexin. Hypocretin is a chemical in the brain that helps control being awake and entering REM sleep.",
      "Hypocretin levels are low in people who have cataplexy. Exactly what causes the loss of hypocretin-producing cells in the brain isn't known. But experts suspect it's due to an autoimmune reaction. An autoimmune reaction is when the body's immune system destroys its own cells.",
      "It's also likely that genetics plays a role in narcolepsy. But the risk of a parent passing this sleep condition to a child is very low — only about 1% to 2%.",

The vitreous fills the space in your eye between the lens and retina and helps the eye maintain its round shape.As you age, the vitreous changes. Over time, it liquifies and contracts — a process that causes it to pull away from the eyeball's inside surface.As the vitreous changes, collagen fibers within the vitreous form clumps and strings. These scattered pieces block some of the light passing through the eye. This casts tiny shadows on your retina that are seen as floaters.",

    "Causes": [
      "Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in your joint, causing the inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack.

      "Family history of gout.If other members of your family have had gout, you're more likely to develop the disease.",
      "Age and sex.Gout occurs more often in men, primarily because women tend to have lower uric acid levels. After menopause, however, women's uric acid levels approach those of men. Men are also more likely to develop gout earlier — usually between the ages of 30 and 50 — whereas women generally develop signs and symptoms after menopause.",

Tophi can develop in several areas, such as your fingers, hands, feet, elbows or Achilles tendons along the backs of your ankles. Tophi usually aren't painful, but they can become swollen and tender during gout attacks.",

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "This condition happens when the kidneys or other parts of the urinary tract let blood cells leak into urine. Different problems can cause this leaking to happen, including:",
      "Urinary tract infections (UTIs).These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder.UTIscan cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With aUTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too.",
      "Kidney infection.This type ofUTIalso is called pyelonephritis.Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that otherUTIscan. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin.",
      "A bladder or kidney stone.The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones.The stones are often painless. But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab.",
      "Enlarged prostate.The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms.",
      "Kidney disease.Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed.Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes. Or it can happen on its own.",
      "Cancer.Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better.",
      "Inherited illnesses.A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine.",
      "Kidney injury.A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine.",
      "Medicines. The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause.",
      "Hard exercise.Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football. It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit. Blood in urine also can happen with long-distance sports, such as marathon running, but it's less clear why. It may be linked to bladder damage or other reasons that don't involve an injury. When hard exercise causes blood in urine, it may go away on its own within a week.If you see blood in your urine after exercise, don't assume it's from exercising. See your health care provider.",

      "Rarely, tumors in other parts of the body cause acromegaly. These include tumors of the lung or pancreas. Sometimes these tumors release growth hormone. Or they make a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone. This signals the pituitary gland to make more growth hormone.",
      "The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain, behind the bridge of the nose. It makes growth hormone and other hormones. Growth hormone plays an important role in controlling physical growth.",
      "The pituitary gland releases growth hormone into the bloodstream. This triggers the liver to make a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1, also called IGF-1. IGF-1 is really what causes bones and other tissues to grow. Too much growth hormone leads to too much IGF-1. And that can cause acromegaly symptoms and complications."

    "Risk factors": [
      "People who have a rare genetic condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 have a higher risk of acromegaly. This condition also is called MEN 1.",
      "In MEN 1, the parathyroid glands, pancreas and pituitary gland may grow tumors and release extra hormones. Extra parathyroid hormone can cause thin bones and kidney stones. A pancreas tumor may make the hormone insulin and cause low blood sugar. If the pituitary tumor makes extra growth hormone, acromegaly results. Very rarely, acromegaly can run in families."

      "Severity of the injury.If the growth plate has been shifted, shattered or crushed, the risk of limb deformity is greater.",
      "Age of the child.Younger children have more years of growth ahead of them, so if the growth plate is permanently damaged, there is more chance of deformity developing. If a child is almost done growing, permanent damage to the growth plate may cause only minimal deformity.",

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Most bad breath starts in your mouth. There are many possible causes, including:",
      "Food.The breakdown of food particles in and around your teeth can lead to more bacteria and cause a foul odor. Eating certain foods, such as onions, garlic and spices, also can cause bad breath. After you digest these foods, they enter your bloodstream, are carried to your lungs and affect your breath.",
      "Tobacco products.Smoking causes unpleasant mouth odor. Tobacco users also are more likely to have gum disease, which is another source of bad breath.",
      "Not keeping your mouth and teeth clean.If you don't brush and floss daily, food particles remain in your mouth, causing bad breath. A colorless, sticky film of bacteria called plaque forms on your teeth. If not brushed away, plaque can irritate your gums. Eventually, it can form plaque-filled pockets between your teeth and gums. The early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis. Late-stage gum disease with bone loss is called periodontitis. Your tongue also can trap bacteria that produce odors. Dentures also can collect odor-causing bacteria and food particles, as can fixed or removable oral appliances such as braces that aren't cleaned regularly or don't fit properly.",
      "Dry mouth.Saliva helps cleanse your mouth, removing particles that cause bad odors. A condition called dry mouth or xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh) can be a part of bad breath because you produce less saliva. Dry mouth naturally occurs during sleep, leading to \"morning breath.\" It gets worse if you sleep with your mouth open. Constant dry mouth can be caused by a problem with the glands that produce saliva and by some diseases.",
      "Medicines.Some medicines can lead to bad breath by causing dry mouth. The body breaks down other medicines and releases chemicals that can be carried on your breath.",
      "Infections in your mouth.Surgical wounds after mouth surgery, such as tooth removal, as well as tooth decay, gum disease or mouth sores, can cause bad breath.",
      "Other mouth, nose and throat conditions.Small stones that form in the tonsils, called tonsil stones or tonsilloliths, are covered with bacteria that can cause bad breath. Infections, or constant swelling in the nose, sinuses or throat, can lead to postnasal drip. This is when fluid from your nose runs down the back of your throat. This condition also can cause bad breath.",
      "Other causes.Diseases such as some cancers can cause a distinctive breath odor. The same is true for disorders related to the body's process of breaking food down into energy. Constant heartburn, which is a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, can lead to bad breath. A foreign body, such as a piece of food lodged in a nostril, can cause bad breath in young children."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you have bad breath, review how you keep your mouth and teeth clean. Try making lifestyle changes, such as brushing your teeth and tongue after eating, using dental floss, and drinking plenty of water.",
      "If you still have bad breath after making changes, see your dentist. If your dentist thinks a more serious condition is causing your bad breath, you may need to see another healthcare professional to find the cause of the odor."

      "Your risk of bad breath is higher if you eat foods known to cause bad breath, such as garlic, onions and spices.

      "In some cases, the reason for heavy menstrual bleeding is unknown. But a number of conditions may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. They include:",
      "Hormones being out of balance.In a typical menstrual cycle, there's a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone. This controls the buildup of the lining of the uterus. The lining of the uterus also is known as the endometrium. This lining is shed during a menstrual period. When hormones are out of balance, the lining becomes too thick and sheds by way of heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.A number of conditions can cause hormone imbalances. These include obesity, insulin resistance, thyroid problems and polycystic ovary syndrome, which also is called PCOS.",
      "Problems with the ovaries.Sometimes ovaries don't release an egg during a menstrual cycle. This also is known as anovulation. When this happens, the body doesn't make the hormone progesterone the way it usually does during a menstrual cycle. This leads to hormone imbalance and may result in heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.",
      "Uterine fibroids.These tumors develop during childbearing years. They are benign, which means they are not cancerous. Uterine fibroids may cause heavier than normal menstrual bleeding or bleeding that goes on for a long time.",
      "Polyps.These small growths on the lining of the uterus may cause menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts for a long time. They may cause bleeding between periods. Polyps also can cause spotting or bleeding after menopause. The growths are not cancerous.",
      "Adenomyosis.In this condition, glands from the lining of the uterus grow into the wall of the uterus itself. This can cause heavy bleeding and painful periods.",

      "Pregnancy complications.A single, heavy, late period may be due to a miscarriage. Another cause of heavy bleeding during pregnancy includes the unusual location of the placenta, which supplies nutrition to the baby and removes waste. The placenta may be too low or covering the opening of the uterus, which is called the cervix. This condition also is known as placenta previa.",
      "Cancer.Cancer of the uterus or cervix can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, unexpected or heavy menstrual bleeding. These cancers can happen before or after menopause. Women who have had an abnormal Pap test in the past are at higher risk of cervical cancer.",

The number of red blood cells is measured by hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues throughout the body.Iron deficiency anemia occurs as the body tries to make up for lost red blood cells. The body uses iron stores to make more hemoglobin so that enough oxygen can be carried to tissues. Heavy menstrual bleeding may make iron levels too low. This may result in iron deficiency anemia.Symptoms include headaches and feeling tired. Although diet plays a role in iron deficiency anemia, the problem is made worse by heavy menstrual periods.",

Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder.UTIscan cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With aUTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too.",
      "Kidney infection.This type ofUTIalso is called pyelonephritis.Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that otherUTIscan. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin.",
      "A bladder or kidney stone.The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones.The stones are often painless. But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab.",
      "Enlarged prostate.The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms.",
      "Kidney disease.Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed.Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes.

      "Inherited illnesses.A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine.",
      "Kidney injury.A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine.",

These symptoms may change in severity throughout the course of the disease."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Huntington's disease is caused by a difference in a single gene that's passed down from a parent. Huntington's disease follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means that a person needs only one copy of the nontypical gene to develop the disorder.",
      "With the exception of genes on the sex chromosomes, a person inherits two copies of every gene — one copy from each parent. A parent with a nontypical gene could pass along the nontypical copy of the gene or the healthy copy. Each child in the family, therefore, has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene that causes the genetic condition."

The lining of the uterus also is known as the endometrium. This lining is shed during a menstrual period. When hormones are out of balance, the lining becomes too thick and sheds by way of heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.A number of conditions can cause hormone imbalances. These include obesity, insulin resistance, thyroid problems and polycystic ovary syndrome, which also is called PCOS.",
      "Problems with the ovaries.Sometimes ovaries don't release an egg during a menstrual cycle. This also is known as anovulation. When this happens, the body doesn't make the hormone progesterone the way it usually does during a menstrual cycle. This leads to hormone imbalance and may result in heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.",
      "Uterine fibroids.These tumors develop during childbearing years. They are benign, which means they are not cancerous. Uterine fibroids may cause heavier than normal menstrual bleeding or bleeding that goes on for a long time.",
      "Polyps.These small growths on the lining of the uterus may cause menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts for a long time. They may cause bleeding between periods. Polyps also can cause spotting or bleeding after menopause. The growths are not cancerous.",

      "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically affects the wall between the two bottom chambers of the heart. This wall is called the septum. The chambers are called the ventricles. The thickened wall might block blood flow out of the heart. This is called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",
      "If there's no significant blocking of blood flow, the condition is called nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. But the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, might stiffen. This makes it hard for the heart to relax. The stiffness also lessens the amount of blood the ventricle can hold and send to the body with each heartbeat.",
      "Heart muscle cells also become arranged differently in people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This is called myofiber disarray. It can trigger irregular heartbeats in some people."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Many conditions can cause shortness of breath and fast, pounding heartbeats. It's important to get a prompt checkup to find the cause and receive the right care. See your healthcare professional if you have a family history ofHCMor any symptoms related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",
      "Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have any of the following symptoms for more than a few minutes:",
      "Rapid or irregular heartbeat.",
      "Trouble breathing.",
      "Chest pain."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually is passed down through families. That means it's inherited. People with one parent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have a 50% chance of having the gene change that causes the disease.",
      "Parents, children, or brothers or sisters of a person with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should ask their healthcare team about screening tests for the disease."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Complications of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can include:",
      "Atrial fibrillation (AFib).A thickened heart muscle and changes in the structure of heart cells can trigger an irregular and often very rapid heartbeat called AFib.AFibalso raises the risk of blood clots, which can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.",
      "Blocked blood flow.In many people, the thickened heart muscle blocks the blood flow leaving the heart. This can cause shortness of breath with activity, chest pain, dizziness and fainting spells.",
      "Mitral valve disease.If the thickened heart muscle blocks the blood flow leaving the heart, the valve between the left heart chambers might not close properly. That valve is called the mitral valve. If it doesn't close properly, blood can leak backward into the left upper chamber. This is a condition called mitral valve regurgitation. It might make hypertrophic cardiomyopathy symptoms worse.",
      "Dilated cardiomyopathy.In a small number of people withHCM, the thickened heart muscle becomes weak and doesn't work well. The condition tends to start in the left lower heart chamber. The chamber becomes larger. The heart pumps with less force.",
      "Heart failure.Over time, the thickened heart muscle can become too stiff to fill the heart with blood. As a result, the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.",
      "Fainting, also called syncope.An irregular heartbeat or blockage of blood flow can sometimes cause fainting. Unexplained fainting can be related to sudden cardiac death, especially if it's happened recently and in a young person.",
      "Sudden cardiac death.Rarely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause heart-related sudden death in people of all ages. Many people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy don't realize they have it. As a result, sudden cardiac death might be the first sign of the condition. It can happen in young people who seem healthy, including high school athletes and other young, active adults."

Screening for cancer with a colonoscopy at regular intervals begins usually about 8 to 10 years after the diagnosis is made. Ask a healthcare professional when and how often you need to have this test done.",

      "Primary sclerosing cholangitis.In this uncommon condition seen in people withIBD, inflammation causes scarring within the bile ducts. This scarring eventually narrows the ducts, restricting bile flow. This can eventually cause liver damage.",
      "Blood clots.IBDincreases the risk of blood clots in veins and arteries.",
      "Severe dehydration.Too much diarrhea can result in dehydration.",
      "Complications of Crohn's disease may include:",
      "Bowel obstruction.Crohn's disease affects the full thickness of the bowel wall. Over time, parts of the bowel can thicken and narrow, which may block the flow of digestive contents. Surgery may be needed to remove the diseased part of the bowel. Rarely, bowel or colon obstruction may be seen in ulcerative colitis and could be a sign of colon cancer.",
      "Malnutrition.Diarrhea, belly pain and cramping may make it difficult for you to eat or for your intestine to absorb enough nutrients to keep you nourished. It's also common to develop anemia due to low iron or vitamin B-12 caused by the disease.",
      "Fistulas.Sometimes inflammation can extend completely through the intestinal wall and create a fistula — a connection between different body parts that is not typical. Fistulas near or around the anal area are the most common kind. But fistulas also can occur internally or toward the wall of the abdominal area. In some cases, a fistula may become infected and form a pocket of pus known as an abscess.",
      "Anal fissure.This is a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus or in the skin around the anus where infections can occur. It's often associated with painful passing of stool and may lead to a fistula around the anus.",

      "Flattened nipple or nipple that turns inward on the affected breast.",
      "For inflammatory breast cancer to be diagnosed, these symptoms must have been present for less than six months."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Inflammatory breast cancer happens when cells in the breast develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.",
      "Most often the DNA changes happen in a cell in one of the tubes, called ducts, that can carry breast milk to the nipple. But the cancer also can begin with a cell in the glandular tissue, called lobules, where breast milk can be produced.",
      "In inflammatory breast cancer, the cancer cells break away from where they started. They travel to the lymphatic vessels in the breast skin. The cells grow to clog the vessels. The blockage in the lymphatic vessels causes skin color changes, swelling and dimpled skin. This skin is a classic sign of inflammatory breast cancer."

If your symptoms respond to antibiotics, additional testing isn't necessary. But if the condition does not improve, your healthcare professional may consider more-serious causes of your symptoms, such as inflammatory breast cancer.",
      "If you've been treated for a breast infection but your symptoms continue, contact your healthcare professional. You may have a mammogram or other test to evaluate your symptoms.

      "Interstitial lung disease can lead to a series of life-threatening complications, including:",
      "High blood pressure in your lungs, also known as pulmonary hypertension.Unlike systemic high blood pressure, this condition affects only the arteries in your lungs. Scar tissue or low oxygen levels restrict the smallest blood vessels, limiting blood flow in your lungs. This raises pressure within the pulmonary arteries and can worsen oxygen exchange, lowering oxygen levels in your blood. Pulmonary hypertension is a serious illness that may get worse over time, causing the right side of your heart to fail.",
      "Right-sided heart failure, also known as cor pulmonale.This serious condition occurs when your heart's lower right chamber, also known as the right ventricle, must pump harder than usual to move blood through blocked pulmonary arteries. Eventually, the right ventricle fails from the extra strain. This is often due to pulmonary hypertension.",
      "Respiratory failure.In the end stage of chronic ILD, respiratory failure occurs when severely low blood oxygen levels, along with rising pressures in the pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle, cause the heart to fail."

      "Feeling terrible guilt, remorse, self-loathing, shame or fear of arrest after the theft",
      "Return of the urges and a repetition of the kleptomania cycle"
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "The causes of kleptomania are not known. Several theories suggest that changes in the brain may be at the root of kleptomania, and that learned patterns of stealing items strengthens the problem over time. More research is needed to better understand these possible causes, but kleptomania may be linked to:",
      "Problems with a naturally occurring brain chemical called serotonin.Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, helps regulate moods and emotions. Low levels of serotonin are common in people prone to impulsive behaviors.",
      "Addictive disorders.Stealing may cause the release of dopamine — another neurotransmitter. Dopamine causes pleasurable feelings, and some people seek this rewarding feeling again and again.",
      "The brain's opioid system.Urges are regulated by the brain's opioid system. An imbalance in this system could make it harder to resist urges.",
      "Learned habit.Urges are very uncomfortable. Responding to these urges by stealing causes a temporary decrease in distress and relief from these urges. This creates a strong habit that becomes hard to break."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you can't stop shoplifting or stealing, seek medical advice. Many people who may have kleptomania don't want to seek treatment because they're afraid they'll be arrested or jailed. However, a mental health provider usually doesn't report your thefts to authorities.",

    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Left untreated, kleptomania can result in severe emotional, family, work, legal and financial problems. For example, you know stealing is wrong but you feel powerless to resist the impulse. As a result, you may be filled with guilt, shame, self-loathing and humiliation. And you may be arrested for stealing. You may otherwise lead a law-abiding life and be confused and upset by your compulsive stealing.",

      "Ruptured air blisters.Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the lungs. These air blisters sometimes burst — allowing air to leak into the space that surrounds the lungs.",
      "Mechanical ventilation.A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe. The ventilator can create an imbalance of air pressure within the chest. The lung may collapse completely."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Symptoms of a pneumothorax can be caused by a variety of health problems, and some can be life-threatening, so seek medical attention. If your chest pain is severe or breathing becomes increasingly difficult, get immediate emergency care."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "In general, men are far more likely to have a pneumothorax than women are. The type of pneumothorax caused by ruptured air blisters is most likely to occur in people between 20 and 40 years old, especially if the person is very tall and underweight.",
      "Underlying lung disease or mechanical ventilation can be a cause or a risk factor for a pneumothorax. Other risk factors include:",
      "Smoking.The risk increases with the length of time and the number of cigarettes smoked, even without emphysema.",
      "Genetics.Certain types of pneumothorax appear to run in families.",
      "Previous pneumothorax.Anyone who has had one pneumothorax is at increased risk of another."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Potential complications vary, depending on the size and severity of the pneumothorax as well as the cause and treatment. Sometimes air may continue to leak if the opening in the lung won't close or pneumothorax may recur."

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Interstitial lung disease seems to occur when an injury to your lungs causes a healing response that isn't proper. Ordinarily, your body creates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage. But in ILD, the repair process doesn't work properly. Tissue in and around the lungs' air sacs, called alveoli, becomes inflamed, scarred and thickened. This makes it harder for oxygen to pass into your bloodstream.",

      "Exposure to toxins at work or in the environment.Working in mining, farming or construction, or for any reason getting exposed to pollutants known to damage lungs, raises your risk of getting ILD.",
      "Smoking.Some forms of ILD are more likely to occur in people with a history of smoking. Active smoking may make the condition worse, especially if you also have emphysema.",
      "Radiation and chemotherapy.Having radiation treatments to your chest or using certain chemotherapy drugs raises your risk of lung disease.",
      "Connective tissue disease.This includes autoimmune diseases that can raise your risk of ILD."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Interstitial lung disease can lead to a series of life-threatening complications, including:",
      "High blood pressure in your lungs, also known as pulmonary hypertension.Unlike systemic high blood pressure, this condition affects only the arteries in your lungs. Scar tissue or low oxygen levels restrict the smallest blood vessels, limiting blood flow in your lungs. This raises pressure within the pulmonary arteries and can worsen oxygen exchange, lowering oxygen levels in your blood. Pulmonary hypertension is a serious illness that may get worse over time, causing the right side of your heart to fail.",
      "Right-sided heart failure, also known as cor pulmonale.This serious condition occurs when your heart's lower right chamber, also known as the right ventricle, must pump harder than usual to move blood through blocked pulmonary arteries. Eventually, the right ventricle fails from the extra strain. This is often due to pulmonary hypertension.",
      "Respiratory failure.In the end stage of chronic ILD, respiratory failure occurs when severely low blood oxygen levels, along with rising pressures in the pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle, cause the heart to fail."

The lining of the uterus also is known as the endometrium. This lining is shed during a menstrual period. When hormones are out of balance, the lining becomes too thick and sheds by way of heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.A number of conditions can cause hormone imbalances. These include obesity, insulin resistance, thyroid problems and polycystic ovary syndrome, which also is called PCOS.",
      "Problems with the ovaries.Sometimes ovaries don't release an egg during a menstrual cycle. This also is known as anovulation. When this happens, the body doesn't make the hormone progesterone the way it usually does during a menstrual cycle. This leads to hormone imbalance and may result in heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.",
      "Uterine fibroids.These tumors develop during childbearing years. They are benign, which means they are not cancerous. Uterine fibroids may cause heavier than normal menstrual bleeding or bleeding that goes on for a long time.",
      "Polyps.These small growths on the lining of the uterus may cause menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts for a long time. They may cause bleeding between periods. Polyps also can cause spotting or bleeding after menopause. The growths are not cancerous.",

Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder.UTIscan cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With aUTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too.",
      "Kidney infection.This type ofUTIalso is called pyelonephritis.Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that otherUTIscan. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin.",
      "A bladder or kidney stone.The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones.The stones are often painless. But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab.",
      "Enlarged prostate.The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms.",
      "Kidney disease.Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed.Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes.

It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again.",

It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms.",

Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy.",

These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming.",

      "The symptoms of childhood obesity aren't clear-cut. Not all children who carry extra pounds are overweight. Some children have larger than average body frames. And it's typical for children to carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. So you might not know if weight is a concern based on how your child looks.",
      "A measurement called the body mass index (BMI) helps healthcare professionals check for overweight status and obese status. A child'sBMIis based on the child's weight and height compared with those of other children the same age and sex using growth charts. Speak with your child's healthcare professional about how your child'sBMIfits with other clues of children's health. For instance, growth patterns, eating and activity habits, stress, sleep, and family history also play a key role in health. Other tests also can help your child's healthcare professional figure out if your child's weight might pose health risks."

      "Extreme thirst and frequent urination.",
      "Breathing that starts and stops many times during sleep.",
      "Poor growth compared with other children of the same sex and age."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Many risk factors make childhood obesity more likely. Some factors that might be within your family's ability to change include the following:",
      "Eating habits.Frequently eating foods that have lots of added sugar, saturated fat or sodium can cause your child to gain weight. These include fast foods, baked goods and vending machine snacks. Candy and desserts also can cause weight gain. So can sugary drinks such as sodas, fruit juices and sports drinks. These types of foods and drinks are found everywhere, and they're designed to appeal to the taste buds. It's OK to enjoy treats such as these once in a while. Try to eat or drink them slowly and mindfully, paying attention to each bite or sip. And be sure to look at the serving sizes listed on the labels. Try not to have more than those amounts in one sitting.",
      "Not enough movement.Children who don't get enough daily movement are more likely to gain weight. So encourage your child or teen to get at least 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Too much time spent being inactive also plays a part in weight gain. Examples of being inactive include sitting to watch TV, play video games or use lots of social media. TV and online shows also may feature junk food commercials or ads. If your child is age 2 or older, try to limit leisure screen time not used for schoolwork to no more than two hours a day. If your child is younger than 2, don't let your child have any screen time.",
      "Mental health factors.Personal stress and family stress can raise a child's risk of obesity. Ongoing stress can cause the body to make high amounts of hormones such as cortisol. High levels of these hormones can cause feelings of increased hunger. They also can trigger cravings for foods that have lots of fat and added sugar. If you think your child has too much stress, talk with your child's healthcare professional. You may be referred to a counselor or another mental healthcare professional who can test your child and offer treatment if needed.",
      "Certain medicines.Some prescription medicines can raise the risk of obesity. They include prednisone, lithium, amitriptyline, paroxetine (Paxil), gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant), propranolol (Inderal LA, Hemangeol), quetiapine (Seroquel), carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol, others), medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera), olanzapine (Zyprexa) and risperidone (Risperdal). Your child's healthcare professional can review the medicines that your child takes. If a certain medicine might be causing weight gain, the healthcare professional might change the dose or switch medicines.",
      "Some other factors for childhood obesity may be out of a parent's ability to control. They include the following:",
      "Family factors.If your child comes from a family of people who tend to gain weight easily, your child may be more likely to put on weight.",
      "Genes and hormones.Sometimes, changes to certain genes can play a part in childhood obesity. So can conditions linked with hormones and many other processes that happen inside the body.",
      "Social and economic factors.People in some communities have limited resources and limited access to supermarkets. As a result, their main access to foods may be convenience foods that don't spoil quickly. These include frozen meals, crackers and cookies. Access to fresh produce, meats and other proteins, and whole grain foods may be limited. And access to safe places for movement activities and outdoor hobbies also may be limited."

      "A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include:",
      "Ameloblastoma.This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence.",
      "Central giant cell granuloma.Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment.",
      "Dentigerous cyst.This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth.",
      "Odontogenic keratocyst.This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.",
      "Odontogenic myxoma.This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment.",
      "Odontoma.This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes.",
      "Other types of cysts and tumors.These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Odontogenic jaw tumors and cysts originate from cells and tissues that are involved in normal tooth development. Other tumors that affect the jaws can be nonodontogenic, meaning that they can develop from other tissues within the jaws that are not related to the teeth, such as bone or soft tissue cells. Generally, the cause of jaw tumors and cysts is not known; however, some are associated with gene changes (mutations) or genetic syndromes.",
      "People with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, also called Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, lack a gene that suppresses tumors. The genetic mutation that causes the syndrome is inherited. This syndrome results in the development of multiple odontogenic keratocysts within the jaws, multiple basal cell skin cancers and other characteristics."

    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you're concerned that you may have symptoms of a jaw tumor or cyst, talk with your primary care provider or dentist.",
      "Many times, jaw cysts and tumors do not have symptoms and are typically discovered on routine screening X-rays done for other reasons. If you are diagnosed with or suspected of having a jaw tumor or cyst, your primary care provider can refer you to a specialist for diagnosis and treatment."

      "The thyroid gland produces two main hormones: thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). These hormones affect every cell in the body. They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates. They help control body temperature. They have an effect on heart rate. And they help control how much protein the body makes.",
      "Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland puts too much of those thyroid hormones into the bloodstream. Conditions that can lead to hyperthyroidism include:",
      "Graves' disease.Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to attack the thyroid gland. That prompts the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.",
      "Overactive thyroid nodules.This condition also is called toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter and Plummer disease. This form of hyperthyroidism happens when a thyroid adenoma makes too much thyroid hormone. An adenoma is a part of the gland that is walled off from the rest of the gland. It forms noncancerous lumps that can make the thyroid bigger than usual.",
      "Thyroiditis.This condition happens when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed. In some cases, it's due to an autoimmune disorder. In others, the reason for it is unclear. The inflammation can cause extra thyroid hormone stored in the thyroid gland to leak into the bloodstream and cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism."

      "Weight loss.People with pancreatic cancer might lose weight as the cancer uses more of the body's energy. Nausea and vomiting caused by cancer treatments or a cancer pressing on the stomach might make it hard to eat. Sometimes the body has trouble getting nutrients from food because the pancreas isn't making enough digestive juices.",
      "Jaundice.Pancreatic cancer that blocks the liver's bile duct can cause jaundice. Signs include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. Jaundice can cause dark-colored urine and pale-colored stools. Jaundice often occurs without belly pain.If the bile duct is blocked, a plastic or metal tube called a stent can be put inside it. The stent helps hold the bile duct open. This is done using a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, also called ERCP.DuringERCP, a health care professional puts a long tube with a tiny camera, called an endoscope, down the throat. The tube goes through the stomach and into the upper part of the small intestine. The health professional puts a dye into the pancreatic ducts and bile ducts through a small tube that fits through the endoscope. The dye helps the ducts show up on imaging tests. The health professional uses those images to place a stent at the right spot in the duct to help hold it open.",
      "Pain.A growing tumor may press on nerves in your abdomen, causing pain that can become severe. Pain medications can help you feel more comfortable. Treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, might help slow tumor growth and provide some pain relief.When medicines aren't helping, a health care professional might suggest a celiac plexus block. This procedure uses a needle to put alcohol into the nerves that control pain in the belly. The alcohol stops the nerves from sending pain signals to the brain.",
      "Bowel blockage.Pancreatic cancer can grow into or press on the first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. This can block the flow of digested food from the stomach into the intestines.A health care professional might suggest putting a tube called a stent in the small intestine to hold it open. Sometimes, it might help to have surgery to place a feeding tube. Or surgery can attach the stomach to a lower part of the intestines where the cancer isn't causing a blockage."

      "The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded.",

However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect.",

      "Flat, light brown spots on the skin, known as cafe au lait spots.These harmless spots are common in many people. But having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They often are present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing.",
      "Freckling in the armpits or groin area.Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds.",
      "Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules.These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.",
      "Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin called neurofibromas.These benign tumors usually grow in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. A growth that involves many nerves is called a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age.",
      "Bone changes.Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg.",
      "Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma.This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults.",
      "Learning disabilities.It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.",
      "Larger than average head size.Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.",
      "Short stature.Children who have NF1 often are below average in height."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by an altered gene that either is passed down by a parent or occurs at conception.",
      "The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17. This gene produces a protein called neurofibromin that helps regulate cell growth. When the gene is altered, it causes a loss of neurofibromin. This allows cells to grow without control."

    "When to see a doctor": [
      "See a healthcare professional if your child has symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1. The tumors are often not cancerous and are slow growing, but complications can be managed. If your child has a plexiform neurofibroma, a medicine is available to treat it."

    "Risk factors": [
      "The biggest risk factor for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a family history. For about half of people who have NF1, the disease was passed down from a parent. People who have NF1 and whose relatives aren't affected are likely to have a new change to a gene.",

      "Skeletal symptoms.Some children have bones that didn't form as usual. This can cause bowing of the legs and fractures that sometimes don't heal. NF1 can cause curvature of the spine, known as scoliosis, that may need bracing or surgery. NF1 also is associated with lower bone mineral density, which increases the risk of weak bones, known as osteoporosis.",
      "Changes in vision.Sometimes a tumor called an optic pathway glioma develops on the optic nerve. When this happens, it can affect vision.",
      "Increase in symptoms during times of hormonal change.Hormonal changes associated with puberty or pregnancy might cause an increase in neurofibromas. Most people who have NF1 have healthy pregnancies but will likely need monitoring by an obstetrician who is familiar with NF1.",
      "Cardiovascular symptoms.People who have NF1 have an increased risk of high blood pressure and may develop blood vessel conditions.",
      "Trouble breathing.Rarely, plexiform neurofibromas can put pressure on the airway.",
      "Cancer.Some people who have NF1 develop cancerous tumors. These usually arise from neurofibromas under the skin or from plexiform neurofibromas. People who have NF1 also have a higher risk of other forms of cancer. They include breast cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer, brain tumors and some types of soft tissue cancer. Screening for breast cancer should begin earlier, at age 30, for women with NF1 compared to the general population.",

A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder. Teachers may say the child has trouble paying attention or that a child is often daydreaming."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Absence seizures usually have a genetic cause.",
      "In general, seizures occur as a result of a burst of electrical impulses from nerve cells in the brain, called neurons. Neurons typically send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them.",
      "In people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern.",
      "People who have seizures also may have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another. These chemical messengers are called neurotransmitters."

      "During the healing process after injury to the penis, scar tissue forms. This can lead to a lump you can feel or to a curve in the penis.",
      "Each side of the penis contains a spongelike tube called a corpus cavernosum. These tubes have many tiny blood vessels. Each of the corpora cavernosa is encased in a sheath of elastic tissue called the tunica albuginea (TOO-nih-kuh al-BYOO-JIN-e-uh). The sheath stretches during an erection.",
      "When you become sexually aroused, more blood flows to these chambers. As the chambers fill with blood, the penis expands, straightens and stiffens into an erection.",
      "In Peyronie disease, when the penis becomes erect, the area with the scar tissue doesn't stretch. As a result, the penis bends or goes through other changes. This can be painful.",

For example, some people with Peyronie disease also have a thick cord under the skin of the palm that can pull the fingers inward. This is called Dupuytren contracture.",
      "Age.Peyronie disease can happen at any age. But it becomes more common between the ages of 45 and 70. Curving of the penis in younger men less often is due to Peyronie disease. It is more commonly called congenital penile curvature. A small amount of curvature in younger men is typical and not concerning.",

Hormone levels can rise when a pituitary tumor makes too much of one or more hormones. Or a large tumor that disrupts the way the pituitary gland works may cause hormone levels to fall."

    "Causes": [
      "The pituitary gland is a small organ about the size of a pea. It's located behind the nose at the base of the brain. Despite its small size, the pituitary gland has an effect on nearly every part of the body. The hormones it makes control important body functions, such as growth, blood pressure and reproduction.",
      "The cause of uncontrolled cell growth in the pituitary gland, which creates a tumor, remains unknown. In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be caused by genes you've inherited. But most have no clear hereditary cause. Still, scientists think that changes in genes may play an important role in how pituitary tumors develop."

      "With severe disease, the small blisters can merge to form larger blisters. Skin affected by dyshidrosis can be painful and very itchy. After a few weeks, the blisters dry and flake off.",
      "Dyshidrosis tends to come back regularly for months or years."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "The cause of dyshidrosis isn't known. It tends to happen in people who have a skin condition called atopic dermatitis (eczema) and allergic conditions, such as hay fever or glove allergy. Dyshidrosis isn't contagious."

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Seeing colors across the light spectrum is a complex process that begins with your eyes' ability to respond to different wavelengths of light.",
      "Light, which contains all color wavelengths, enters your eye through the cornea and passes through the lens and transparent, jellylike tissue in your eye (vitreous humor) to wavelength-sensitive cells (cones) at the back of your eye in the macular area of the retina. The cones are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green) or long (red) wavelengths of light. Chemicals in the cones trigger a reaction and send the wavelength information through your optic nerve to your brain.",
      "If your eyes work as they should, you perceive color. But if your cones don't work properly, you will be unable to distinguish the colors red, green or blue."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you suspect you have problems distinguishing certain colors or your color vision changes, see an eye doctor for testing. It's important that children get comprehensive eye exams, including color vision testing, before starting school.",
      "There's no cure for inherited color deficiencies, but if illness or eye disease is the cause, treatment may improve color vision."

    "Risk factors": [
      "Several factors increase the risk of color blindness, including:",
      "Gender.Colorblindness is much more common in males than in females.",
      "Family history.Colorblindness is often inherited, meaning it is passed down through families. You can inherit a mild, moderate or severe degree of the condition. Inherited color deficiencies usually affect both eyes, and the severity doesn't change over your lifetime.",
      "Diseases.Some conditions that can increase the risk of color deficiency include sickle cell anemia, diabetes, macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Parkinson's disease, chronic alcoholism and leukemia. One eye may be more affected than the other, and the color deficiency may get better if the underlying disease can be treated.",
      "Certain medicines.Some medicines can affect color vision, such as hydrochloroquine, a medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "Damage to the eye.Color blindness can be caused by trauma to the eye as a result of injury, surgery, radiation therapy or laser treatment."

And one copy is inherited from the mother, known as a maternal gene. For most types of genes, if one copy is active, also known as expressed, then the other copy also is expressed. But it's typical for some types of genes to act alone.",

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Damage to the adrenal glands causes Addison's disease. These glands sit just above the kidneys. The adrenal glands are part of the system of glands and organs that makes hormones, also called the endocrine system. The adrenal glands make hormones that affect almost every organ and tissue in the body.",
      "The adrenal glands are made up of two layers. The inner layer, called the medulla, makes hormones such as adrenaline. Those hormones control the body's response to stress. The outer layer, called the cortex, makes a group of hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids include:",
      "Glucocorticoids.These hormones include cortisol, and they affect the body's ability to turn food into energy. They also play a role in the immune system and help the body respond to stress.",
      "Mineralocorticoids.These hormones include aldosterone. They balance the body's sodium and potassium to keep blood pressure in a healthy range.",
      "Androgens.In all people, the adrenal glands make small amounts of these sex hormones. They cause male sexual development. And they affect muscle mass, body hair, sex drive, and a sense of well-being in all people.",

    "Risk factors": [
      "Most people who get Addison's disease don't have any factors that put them at higher risk of developing the condition. But the following may raise the risk of adrenal insufficiency:",
      "A history of having a disease or surgery that affects the pituitary gland or the adrenal glands.",
      "Certain genetic changes that affect the pituitary or adrenal glands. These include gene changes that cause the inherited disease congenital adrenal hyperplasia.",
      "Other autoimmune endocrine conditions, such as hypothyroidism or type 1 diabetes.",
      "Traumatic brain injury."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Addison's disease can lead to other health conditions called complications. These include adrenal crisis, also called addisonian crisis. If you have Addison's disease and haven't started treatment, you may develop this life-threatening complication.",
      "Stress on the body such as injury, infection or illness can trigger adrenal crisis. Typically, the adrenal glands make two or three times the usual amount of cortisol in response to physical stress. But with adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol to meet this need. And that can lead to adrenal crisis.",
      "Adrenal crisis results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. This complication needs treatment right away."

    "Causes": [
      "It's not clear what causes primary biliary cholangitis. Many experts consider it an autoimmune disease in which the body turns against its own cells. Researchers believe this autoimmune response may be triggered by environmental and genetic factors.",
      "The liver inflammation seen in primary biliary cholangitis starts when certain types of white blood cells called T cells, also known as T lymphocytes, start to collect in the liver. Usually, these immune cells detect and help defend against germs, such as bacteria and viruses. But in primary biliary cholangitis, they mistakenly destroy the healthy cells that line the small bile ducts in the liver.",
      "Inflammation in the smallest ducts spreads and eventually damages other cells in the liver. As the cells die, they're replaced by scar tissue, also known as fibrosis, that can lead to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is scarring of liver tissue that makes it difficult for your liver to work properly."

      "Infections,such as a urinary tract infection.",
      "Smoking cigarettes,especially over long periods of time.",
      "Exposure to toxic chemicals,such as in certain work environments."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "As liver damage worsens, primary biliary cholangitis can cause serious health problems, including:",
      "Liver scarring, called cirrhosis.Cirrhosis makes it difficult for your liver to work and may lead to liver failure. It means the later stage of primary biliary cholangitis. People with primary biliary cholangitis and cirrhosis have a poor medical outlook. They also have a higher risk of other complications.",
      "Increased pressure in the portal vein, called portal hypertension.Blood from your intestine, spleen and pancreas enters your liver through a large blood vessel called the portal vein. When scar tissue from cirrhosis blocks normal blood flow through your liver, blood backs up. This causes increased pressure inside the vein. Also, because blood doesn't flow correctly through your liver, drugs and other toxins aren't filtered properly from your bloodstream.",
      "Enlarged veins, called varices.When blood flow through the portal vein is slowed or blocked, blood may back up into other veins. It usually backs up into those in your stomach and esophagus. Increased pressure may cause delicate veins to break open and bleed. Bleeding in the upper stomach or esophagus is a life-threatening emergency. It requires immediate medical care.",
      "Enlarged spleen, called splenomegaly.Your spleen may become swollen with white blood cells and platelets. This is because your body no longer filters toxins out of the bloodstream as it should.",
      "Gallstones and bile duct stones.If bile cannot flow through the bile ducts, it may harden into stones in the ducts. These stones can cause pain and infection.",
      "Liver cancer.Liver scarring increases your risk of liver cancer. If you have liver scarring, you'll need regular cancer screening.",
      "Weak bones, called osteoporosis.People with primary biliary cholangitis have an increased risk of weak, brittle bones that may break more easily.",
      "Vitamin deficiencies.Not having enough bile affects your digestive system's ability to absorb fats and the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E and K. Because of this, some people with advanced primary biliary cholangitis may have low levels of these vitamins. Low levels can result in a variety of health problems, including night blindness and bleeding disorders.",
      "High cholesterol.Up to 80% of people with primary biliary cholangitis have high cholesterol.",
      "Decreased mental function, called hepatic encephalopathy.Some people with advanced primary biliary cholangitis and cirrhosis have personality changes. They also may have problems with memory and concentration.",
      "Increased risk of other disease.Primary biliary cholangitis is associated with other disorders, including those that affect the thyroid, skin and joints. It also can be associated with dry eyes and mouth, a disorder called Sjogren's syndrome."

      "The aortic valve is one of four valves that control blood flow through the heart. It separates the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, and the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aortic valve has flaps, also called cusps or leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat.",
      "In aortic valve regurgitation, the valve doesn't close properly. This causes blood to leak back into the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. As a result, the chamber holds more blood. This could cause it to get larger and thicken.",
      "At first, the larger left ventricle helps maintain good blood flow with more force. But eventually, the heart becomes weak.",
      "Any condition that damages the aortic valve can cause aortic valve regurgitation. Causes may include:",
      "Heart valve disease present at birth.Some people are born with an aortic valve that has only two cusps, called a bicuspid valve. Others are born with connected cusps rather than the typical three separate ones. Sometimes the valve may have only one cusp, called a unicuspid valve. Other times, there are four cusps, called a quadricuspid valve.Having a parent or sibling with a bicuspid valve raises your risk of the condition. But you can have a bicuspid valve even if you don't have a family history of the condition.",
      "Narrowing of the aortic valve, called aortic stenosis.Calcium deposits can build up on the aortic valve as you age. The buildup causes the aortic valve to stiffen and become narrow. It prevents the valve from opening properly. Aortic stenosis also may prevent the valve from closing properly.",
      "Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves.This life-threatening condition also is called endocarditis. It's usually caused by an infection. It can damage the aortic valve.",
      "Rheumatic fever.This condition was once a common childhood illness in the United States. Strep throat can cause it. Rheumatic fever can cause the aortic valve to become stiff and narrow, in turn causing blood to leak. If you have an irregular heart valve due to rheumatic fever, it's called rheumatic heart disease.",
      "Other health conditions.Other rare conditions can cause the aorta to get bigger and damage the aortic valve. These include a connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome. Some immune system conditions, such as lupus, also can lead to aortic valve regurgitation.",
      "Tear or injury of the body's main artery.The body's main artery is the aorta. A traumatic chest injury may damage the aorta and cause aortic regurgitation. So might a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, called an aortic dissection."

      "Mitral valve prolapse.In this condition, the mitral valve's flaps bulge back into the left upper heart chamber when the heart squeezes. This common heart problem can prevent the mitral valve from closing tightly and cause blood to flow backward.",
      "Rheumatic fever.Rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated strep throat. Rheumatic fever can damage the mitral valve, leading to mitral valve regurgitation early or later in life. If rheumatic fever causes mitral valve disease, the condition is called rheumatic mitral valve disease. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States.",
      "Heart attack.A heart attack can damage the area of the heart muscle that supports the mitral valve. If there is a lot of heart attack damage, sudden and severe mitral valve regurgitation can occur. A leaky mitral valve caused by a heart attack is called ischemic mitral regurgitation.",

      "Damaged tissue cords.Over time, the pieces of tissue that hold the flaps of the mitral valve to the heart wall may stretch or tear. This is especially likely in people with mitral valve prolapse. A tear can cause blood to suddenly leak through the mitral valve. It may require mitral valve repair surgery. A chest injury also can cause rupture of the cords.",

      "Rhegmatogenous (reg-mu-TOJ-uh-nus).This type of retinal detachment is the most common. A rhegmatogenous detachment is caused by a hole or tear in the retina that lets fluid pass through and collect underneath the retina. This fluid builds up and causes the retina to pull away from underlying tissues. The areas where the retina detaches lose their blood supply and stop working. This causes you to lose vision.The most common cause of rhegmatogenous detachment is aging. As you age, gel-like material that fills the inside of your eye, called vitreous (VIT-ree-us), may change in texture and shrink or become more liquid. Usually, the vitreous separates from the surface of the retina without any complications. This is a common condition called a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).As the vitreous separates or peels off the retina, it may tug on the retina with enough force to create a tear. Most of the time it doesn't. But if aPVDcauses a tear and the tear isn't treated, the liquid vitreous can pass through the tear into the space behind the retina. This causes the retina to detach.",
      "Tractional.This type of detachment can happen when scar tissue grows on the retina's surface. The scar tissue causes the retina to pull away from the back of the eye. Tractional detachment usually is seen in people who have poorly controlled diabetes.",

In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions also tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.",
      "In retinoblastoma, this growth of cells happens in the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive lining on the inside of the eye. The retina is made up of nerve tissue that senses light as it comes in through the front of the eye. The light causes the retina to send signals to the brain. The brain interprets the signals as images.",

      "Extreme tiredness and fatigue, often due to poor sleep."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "When someone has hay fever, the immune system identifies a harmless airborne substance as being harmful. This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever."

These medicines can be taken by mouth or by shot, also called injection. They include morphine (MS Contin, Mitigo, others), oxycodone (Roxicodone, Oxycontin, others) and codeine.",
      "High-altitude periodic breathing.A Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern can occur if you're at a very high altitude. The change in oxygen at a high altitude can cause fast breathing, known as hyperventilation, followed by taking in too little air.",

      "Your brain senses this impaired breathing and briefly rouses you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway. This awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it.",
      "You may awaken with shortness of breath that corrects itself quickly, within one or two deep breaths. Or you might make a snorting, choking or gasping sound.",
      "This pattern can repeat itself 5 to 30 times or more each hour, all night long. These disruptions impair your ability to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep, and you'll probably feel sleepy during your waking hours.",
      "People with obstructive sleep apnea might not be aware of their interrupted sleep. Many people with this type of sleep apnea don't realize they haven't slept well all night."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Consult a health care professional if you have, or if your partner observes, the following:",
      "Snoring loud enough to disturb your sleep or the sleep of others.",
      "Waking up gasping or choking.",
      "Pausing in your breathing during sleep.",
      "Having excessive daytime drowsiness. This may cause you to fall asleep while working, watching television or even driving a vehicle.",
      "Snoring doesn't necessarily indicate something potentially serious, and not everyone who snores has obstructive sleep apnea.",
      "Be sure to talk to a member of your health care team if you snore loudly, especially if your snoring is interrupted by periods of silence. Snoring may be loudest — and breath pauses known as apneas may be more common — when you sleep on your back.",
      "Ask your health care team about any sleep problem that leaves you fatigued, sleepy and irritable on a regular basis. Excessive daytime drowsiness may be due to other disorders, such as narcolepsy."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Anyone can develop obstructive sleep apnea. However, certain factors put you at increased risk, including:",
      "Excess weight.Most but not all people with obstructive sleep apnea are overweight. Fat deposits around the upper airway can obstruct breathing. Medical conditions that are associated with obesity, such as hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome, also can cause obstructive sleep apnea.",
      "Older age.The risk of obstructive sleep apnea increases as you age but appears to level off after your 60s and 70s.",
      "Narrowed airway.A naturally narrow airway is a trait that can be passed down in your family. Or your tonsils or adenoids might become enlarged and block your airway.",
      "High blood pressure, known as hypertension.Obstructive sleep apnea is relatively common in people with hypertension.",
      "Chronic nasal congestion.Obstructive sleep apnea occurs twice as often in those who have consistent nasal congestion at night, regardless of the cause.",
      "Smoking.People who smoke are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea.",
      "Diabetes.Obstructive sleep apnea might be more common in people with diabetes.",
      "Male sex.In general, men are 2 to 3 times more likely as premenopausal women to have obstructive sleep apnea. However, the risk of obstructive sleep apnea increases in women after menopause.",

    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Obstructive sleep apnea is considered a serious medical condition. Complications can include:",
      "Daytime fatigue and sleepiness.Because of a lack of restorative sleep at night, people with obstructive sleep apnea often have severe daytime drowsiness, fatigue and irritability. They might have difficulty concentrating and find themselves falling asleep at work, while watching TV or even when driving. This can put them at higher risk of work-related accidents.Children and young people with obstructive sleep apnea might do poorly in school and commonly have attention or behavior problems.",
      "Cardiovascular problems.Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during obstructive sleep apnea increase blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system. Many people with obstructive sleep apnea develop high blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart disease.The worse the obstructive sleep apnea, the greater the risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure and stroke.Obstructive sleep apnea also increases the risk of heart rhythm problems known as arrhythmias. Arrhythmias can lower blood pressure. If there's underlying heart disease, these repeated multiple episodes of arrhythmias could lead to sudden death.",
      "Complications with medicines and surgery.Obstructive sleep apnea also is a concern with certain medicines and general anesthesia. Medicines such as sedatives, some prescription painkillers and general anesthetics, relax the upper airway and can make obstructive sleep apnea worse.If you have obstructive sleep apnea, having major surgery can worsen breathing problems. This is especially true if you have been sedated and you were lying on your back. People with obstructive sleep apnea might be more prone to complications after surgery.Before you have surgery, tell your surgeon if you have obstructive sleep apnea or symptoms related to the condition. You may need to get tested for obstructive sleep apnea before surgery.",
      "Eye problems.Some research has found a connection between obstructive sleep apnea and certain eye conditions, such as glaucoma. Eye complications can usually be treated.",
      "Sleep-deprived partners.Loud snoring can keep those around you from getting good rest and eventually disrupt your relationships. Some partners choose to sleep in another room.",
      "People with obstructive sleep apnea also may complain of memory problems, morning headaches, and mood swings or depression. They also may need to urinate often at night.",
      "Obstructive sleep apnea might be a risk factor for COVID-19. People with obstructive sleep apnea have been found to be at higher risk for developing a severe form of COVID-19. They may be more likely to need hospital treatment than do those who don't have obstructive sleep apnea."

People with narcolepsy feel less alert and focused during the day. They also fall asleep without warning. Sleep can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again.",
      "Automatic behaviors.Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, they may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. They might continue to perform that task while asleep. After waking, they can't remember what they did, and they probably didn't do it well.",
      "Sudden loss of muscle tone.This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles for up to a few minutes. It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms.",
      "Sleep paralysis.People with narcolepsy may experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, the person can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. The paralysis is usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy.",
      "Hallucinations.Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming.",
      "Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "The exact cause of narcolepsy is not known. People with type 1 narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin (hi-poe-KREE-tin), also called orexin. Hypocretin is a chemical in the brain that helps control being awake and entering REM sleep.",
      "Hypocretin levels are low in people who have cataplexy. Exactly what causes the loss of hypocretin-producing cells in the brain isn't known. But experts suspect it's due to an autoimmune reaction. An autoimmune reaction is when the body's immune system destroys its own cells.",

      "Pregnancy and childbirth.Vaginal delivery of one or more children contributes to the weakening of your pelvic floor support structures, increasing your risk of prolapse. The more pregnancies you have, the greater your risk of developing any type of pelvic organ prolapse. Women who have only cesarean deliveries are less likely to develop prolapse.",
      "Age.Small bowel prolapse and other types of pelvic organ prolapse occur more often with increasing age. As you get older, you tend to lose muscle mass and muscle strength — in your pelvic muscles as well as other muscles.",
      "Pelvic surgery.Removal of your uterus (hysterectomy) or surgical procedures to treat incontinence may increase your risk of developing small bowel prolapse.",
      "Increased abdominal pressure.Being overweight increases pressure inside your abdomen, which increases your risk of developing small bowel prolapse. Other factors that increase pressure include ongoing (chronic) cough and straining during bowel movements.",
      "Smoking.Smoking is associated with developing prolapse because smokers frequently cough, increasing abdominal pressure.",
      "Race.For unknown reasons, Hispanic and white women are at higher risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse.",
      "Connective tissue disorders.You may be genetically prone to prolapse due to weaker connective tissues in your pelvic area, making you naturally more susceptible to small bowel prolapse and other types of pelvic organ prolapse."

But the injury may interfere with the brain receiving the messages it needs to control the bladder.Changes in bladder control increase the risk of urinary tract infections. The changes also may cause kidney infections and kidney or bladder stones. During rehabilitation, you learn ways to help empty your bladder.",
      "Bowel control.The stomach and intestines work much like they did before the injury, but control of bowel movements is often altered. A high-fiber diet might help regulate the bowels. You also can learn ways to help control your bowel.",
      "Pressure injuries.Below the neurological level of your injury, you might have lost some or all skin sensations. Therefore, your skin can't send a message to your brain when it's injured by certain things such as prolonged pressure.This can increase the risk of getting pressure sores. Changing positions often — with help, if needed — can help prevent the sores. Proper skin care also can help prevent pressure sores.",
      "Circulatory control.People with a spinal cord injury may have low blood pressure when they rise, known as orthostatic hypotension. They also may have swelling in the arms and legs. This can increase the risk of developing blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolus.Another issue with circulatory control is a potentially life-threatening rise in blood pressure, known as autonomic dysreflexia. Your rehabilitation team can teach you how to address these issues if they affect you.",
      "Respiratory system.If the injury affects the stomach and chest muscles, it may be hard to breathe and cough.The neurological level of injury determines what kind of breathing problems you may have. If the injury affects your neck and chest, you might have an increased risk of pneumonia or other lung conditions. Medicines and therapy can be helpful for treatment and prevention.",
      "Bone density.A spinal cord injury increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures below the level of injury.",
      "Muscle tone.Some people with spinal cord injuries have a tightening or motion in the muscles, known as spasticity. Other people may have soft and limp muscles lacking muscle tone, known as flaccidity.",
      "Fitness and wellness.Weight loss and muscle thinning are common soon after a spinal cord injury. Because limited mobility can lead to a more sedentary lifestyle, there is a risk of weight gain, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.A dietitian can help you eat a nutritious diet to sustain a healthy weight. Physical and occupational therapists can help you develop a fitness and exercise program.",
      "Sexual health.A spinal cord injury may lead to changes in erection and ejaculation, or in changes in lubrication. Healthcare professionals specializing in urology or fertility can offer options for sexual functioning and fertility.",
      "Pain.Some people have pain, such as muscle or joint pain, from overuse of particular muscle groups. Nerve pain can occur after a spinal cord injury, especially in someone with an incomplete injury.",

      "Each valve has flaps, also called cusps, that open and close once during each heartbeat. Sometimes, the valves don't open or close properly. If a valve doesn't fully open or close, blood flow is reduced or blocked.",
      "In aortic valve stenosis, the valve between the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle, and the body's main artery, called the aorta, is narrowed and doesn't open completely. This narrowing is called stenosis.",
      "When the aortic valve opening is narrowed, the heart must work harder to pump enough blood to the body. The extra work can cause the lower left heart chamber to get thick. Eventually the heart may become weak.",
      "Aortic valve stenosis causes include:",

      "Calcium buildup on the valve, called aortic valve calcification.Calcium is a mineral found in the blood. As blood moves over the aortic valve, calcium can collect on the valve. The calcium deposits may never cause any problems. Aortic valve stenosis that's related to increasing age and calcium deposit buildup usually doesn't cause symptoms until age 70 or 80. But in some people — particularly those with changes in the aortic valve at birth — calcium deposits might cause the valve to narrow at a younger age.",

      "Calcium deposits.As you age, calcium deposits can build up around the mitral valve. This can cause narrowing of the structures that support the mitral valve flaps. The condition is called mitral annular calcification, or MAC for short. SevereMACcan cause mitral stenosis symptoms. It's difficult to treat even with surgery. People with calcium around the mitral valve often have similar problems with the heart's aortic valve.",

      "Blood clots.Irregular heartbeats linked to mitral valve stenosis can cause blood clots to form in the heart. If a blood clot from the heart travels to the brain, a stroke can occur.",
      "High blood pressure in the lung arteries.The medical name for this condition is pulmonary hypertension. It can happen if a narrowed mitral valve slows or blocks blood flow. Decreased blood flow raises pressure in the lung arteries. The heart must work harder to pump blood through the lungs.",
      "Right-sided heart failure.Changes in blood flow and high pressure in the lung arteries put a strain on the heart. The heart must work harder to pump blood to the chambers on the right side of the heart. The extra effort eventually causes the heart muscle to become weak and fail."

The risk of miscarriages may rise in women who smoke tobacco. When a pregnant person's partner smokes, that also raises the risk of miscarriage — even when the pregnant person is not a smoker. And smoking can raise the risk of erectile dysfunction and a low sperm count in men.",

      "The symptoms of cavities vary, depending on how many you have and where they're located. When a cavity is just beginning, you may not have any symptoms. As the decay gets larger, it may cause symptoms such as:",
      "Toothache and other pain.",
      "Tooth sensitivity.",
      "Mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold.",
      "Holes or pits in your teeth that you can see.",
      "Brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth.",
      "Pain when you bite down."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Tooth decay causes cavities. This is a process that occurs over time.",
      "Here's how tooth decay happens:",
      "Plaque forms.Dental plaque is a clear sticky film that coats your teeth. It's due to eating a lot of sugars and starches and not cleaning your teeth well. When you don't clean sugars and starches off your teeth, bacteria quickly begin feeding on them and forming plaque. Plaque that stays on your teeth can harden under or above your gumline into tartar. Tartar makes plaque harder to remove and creates a shield for bacteria. A dental professional needs to remove this plaque.",
      "Plaque attacks.The acids from bacteria remove minerals in your tooth's hard, outer enamel. This erosion causes tiny openings or holes in the enamel — the first stage of cavities. Once areas of enamel are worn away, the bacteria and acid can reach the next layer of your teeth, called dentin. This layer is softer than enamel and less resistant to acid, causing your teeth to be more sensitive.",
      "Damage continues.As tooth decay happens, the bacteria and acid move through your teeth to the inner tooth material (pulp) that contains nerves and blood vessels. The pulp becomes swollen and irritated from the bacteria. Because there is no place for the swelling to expand inside of a tooth, the nerve becomes pressed, causing pain. Sometimes pain and damage can spread outside of the tooth root to the bone, causing bone loss around the tooth and even reaching nearby teeth."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Anyone who has teeth can get cavities, but these factors raise the risk:",
      "Tooth location.Decay most often occurs in your back teeth — your molars and premolars. These teeth have lots of grooves, pits and crannies, and multiple roots that can collect food particles. That's why they're harder to keep clean than your smoother, easy-to-reach front teeth.",
      "Certain foods and drinks.Foods that cling to your teeth for a long time are more likely to cause decay than foods that are easily washed away by saliva. These foods include milk, ice cream, honey, sugar, soda, dried fruit, cake, cookies, hard candy and mints, dry cereal, and chips.",
      "Snacking or sipping a lot.When you snack or sip sugary drinks a lot, you give mouth bacteria more fuel to make acids that attack your teeth and wear them down. And sipping soda or other acidic drinks throughout the day helps create a continual acid bath over your teeth.",
      "Bedtime baby feeding.When babies are given bedtime bottles filled with milk, formula, juice or other liquids that have sugar, these beverages remain on their teeth for hours while they sleep. This feeds bacteria that can cause decay. This damage often is called baby bottle tooth decay. Similar damage can occur when toddlers wander around drinking from a sippy cup filled with these beverages.",
      "Not brushing your teeth well.If you don't clean your teeth soon after eating and drinking, plaque forms quickly, and the first stages of decay and gingivitis can begin.",
      "Not getting enough fluoride.Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, helps prevent cavities. It also can reverse the earliest stages of tooth damage. Because of its benefits for teeth, fluoride is added to many public water supplies. It's also a common ingredient in toothpaste and mouth rinses. But bottled water usually does not contain fluoride.",
      "Younger or older age.In the U.S., cavities are common in very young children and teenagers. Older adults also are at higher risk. Over time, teeth can wear down and gums may recede, making teeth more likely to decay. Older adults also may use more medicines that reduce saliva flow, raising the risk of tooth decay.",
      "Dry mouth.Dry mouth is caused by a lack of saliva. Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away food and plaque from your teeth. Substances found in saliva also help counter the acid produced by bacteria. Certain medicines, some medical conditions, radiation to your head or neck, or certain chemotherapy drugs can raise your risk of cavities by reducing saliva production.",
      "Worn fillings or dental devices.Over the years, dental fillings can weaken, begin to break down or get rough edges. This allows plaque to build up more easily and makes it harder to remove. Dental devices can stop fitting well, allowing decay to begin under them.",
      "Heartburn.Heartburn, a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause stomach acid to flow into your mouth. This is called reflux. It can wear away the enamel of your teeth and cause a lot of damage. This exposes more of the dentin to bacteria, creating tooth decay. Your dentist may recommend that you talk with your healthcare professional to see if GERD is causing your enamel loss.",
      "Eating disorders.Anorexia and bulimia can lead to a lot of tooth erosion and cavities. Stomach acid from repeated vomiting, called purging, washes over the teeth and begins eating away at the enamel. Eating disorders also can get in the way of saliva production."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Cavities and tooth decay are so common that you may not take them seriously. And you may think that it doesn't matter if children get cavities in their baby teeth. But cavities and tooth decay can have serious and lasting complications, even for children who don't have their permanent teeth yet.",
      "Complications of cavities may include:",
      "Pain.",

    "Causes": [
      "It's possible that traveler's diarrhea may stem from the stress of traveling or a change in diet. But usually infectious agents — such as bacteria, viruses or parasites — are to blame. You typically develop traveler's diarrhea after ingesting food or water contaminated with organisms from feces.",

    "Causes": [
      "In trigeminal neuralgia, the trigeminal nerve's function is disrupted. Contact between a blood vessel and the trigeminal nerve at the base of the brain often causes the pain. The blood vessel may be an artery or a vein. This contact puts pressure on the nerve and doesn't allow it to function as usual.",

    "Causes": [
      "Human cells usually contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from the sperm, the other from the egg.",
      "Down syndrome results from an unusual cell division involving chromosome 21. This unusual cell division results in an extra partial or full chromosome 21. This extra genetic material changes how the body and brain develop. It is responsible for the physical features and developmental problems of Down syndrome.",
      "Any one of three genetic changes can cause Down syndrome:",
      "Trisomy 21.About 95% of the time, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21. This means the person has three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies. The extra chromosome 21 is in all cells in the body. Trisomy 21 results from an unusual cell division during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell.",
      "Mosaic Down syndrome.This is a rare form of Down syndrome. People with mosaic Down syndrome have only some cells with an extra copy of chromosome 21. This mosaic of typical and changed cells is caused by an unusual cell division after the egg has been fertilized by the sperm.",
      "Translocation Down syndrome.In a small number of people, Down syndrome can occur when a part of chromosome 21 becomes attached, also called translocated, onto another chromosome.

The risk of having a child with Down syndrome increases after a pregnant person is 35 years of age. But most children with Down syndrome are born to pregnant people under age 35 because they have far more babies.",
      "Being carriers of the genetic translocation for Down syndrome.Either parent can pass the genetic translocation for Down syndrome on to their children.",

These may include changes in the structure of the stomach and intestines. There is a higher risk of developing digestive problems, such as intestinal blockage, heartburn called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or celiac disease.",
      "Problems with the immune system.Because of differences in their immune systems, people with Down syndrome are at higher risk of developing autoimmune disorders, some forms of cancer and infectious diseases such as pneumonia.",

      "Being overweight.People with Down syndrome are more likely to be overweight or obese compared with the general population.",
      "Spinal problems.In some people with Down syndrome, the top two vertebrae in the neck may not line up as they should. This is called atlantoaxial instability. The condition puts people at risk of serious injury to the spinal cord from activities that bend the neck too far. Some examples of these activities include contact sports and horseback riding.",
      "Leukemia.Young children with Down syndrome have a higher risk of leukemia.",

      "Heart and blood vessel disease.Diabetes increases the risk of some problems with the heart and blood vessels. These include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure.",
      "Nerve damage (neuropathy).Too much sugar in the blood can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that feed the nerves. This is especially true in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain. This usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and spreads upward. Poorly controlled blood sugar could cause you to lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs over time.Damage to the nerves that affect the digestive system can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue.",
      "Kidney damage (nephropathy).The kidneys have millions of tiny blood vessels that keep waste from entering the blood. Diabetes can damage this system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or end-stage kidney disease that can't be reversed. End-stage kidney disease needs to be treated with mechanical filtering of the kidneys (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.",
      "Eye damage.Diabetes can damage the blood vessels in the retina (part of the eye that senses light) (diabetic retinopathy). This could cause blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.",
      "Foot damage.Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of some foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections. These infections may need to be treated with toe, foot or leg removal (amputation).",
      "Skin and mouth conditions.Diabetes may leave you more prone to infections of the skin and mouth. These include bacterial and fungal infections. Gum disease and dry mouth also are more likely.",
      "Pregnancy complications.High blood sugar levels can be dangerous for both the parent and the baby. The risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and birth defects increases when diabetes isn't well-controlled.

      "The primary sign of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is frequent, involuntary and uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing that are exaggerated or not connected to your emotional state. Laughter often turns to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing.",
      "The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded.",
      "Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect.",
      "If you think you have PBA, talk to your doctor. If you have a neurological condition, you might already be treated by a doctor who can diagnose PBA. Helpful specialists include neuropsychologists, neurologists and psychiatrists.",

      "The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland makes two main hormones: thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). These hormones affect every cell in the body. They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates. They help control body temperature. They have an effect on heart rate. And they help control how much protein the body makes.",
      "Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough hormones. Conditions or problems that can lead to hypothyroidism include:",
      "Autoimmune disease.The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's disease. Autoimmune diseases happen when the immune system makes antibodies that attack healthy tissues. Sometimes that process involves the thyroid gland and affects its ability to make hormones.",
      "Thyroid surgery.Surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland can lower the gland's ability to make thyroid hormones or stop it completely.",
      "Radiation therapy.Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect the thyroid gland and lead to hypothyroidism.",
      "Thyroiditis.Thyroiditis happens when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed. This may be due to an infection. Or it can result from an autoimmune disorder or another medical condition affecting the thyroid. Thyroiditis can trigger the thyroid to release all of its stored thyroid hormone at once. That causes a spike in thyroid activity, a condition called hyperthyroidism. Afterward, the thyroid becomes underactive.",
      "Medicine.A number of medicines may lead to hypothyroidism. One such medicine is lithium, which is used to treat some psychiatric disorders. If you're taking medicine, ask your heath care provider about its effect on the thyroid gland.",
      "Less often, hypothyroidism may be caused by:",
      "Problems present at birth.Some babies are born with a thyroid gland that doesn't work correctly. Others are born with no thyroid gland. In most cases, the reason the thyroid gland didn't develop properly is not clear. But some children have an inherited form of a thyroid disorder. Often, infants born with hypothyroidism don't have noticeable symptoms at first. That's one reason why most states require newborn thyroid screening.",
      "Pituitary disorder.A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to make enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This is usually because of a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland.",
      "Pregnancy.Some people develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy. If hypothyroidism happens during pregnancy and isn't treated, it raises the risk of pregnancy loss, premature delivery and preeclampsia. Preeclampsia causes a significant rise in blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. Hypothyroidism also can seriously affect the developing fetus.",
      "Not enough iodine.The thyroid gland needs the mineral iodine to make thyroid hormones. Iodine is found mainly in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt. Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism. Too much iodine can make hypothyroidism worse in people who already have the condition. In some parts of the world, it's common for people not to get enough iodine in their diets. The addition of iodine to table salt has almost eliminated this problem in the United States."

      "Heart problems.Hypothyroidism can lead to a higher risk of heart disease and heart failure. That's mainly because people with an underactive thyroid tend to develop high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol.",
      "Peripheral neuropathy.Hypothyroidism that goes without treatment for a long time can damage the peripheral nerves. These are the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Peripheral neuropathy may cause pain, numbness and tingling in the arms and legs.",
      "Infertility.Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which can limit fertility. Some of the causes of hypothyroidism, such as autoimmune disorders, also can harm fertility.",
      "Birth defects.Babies born to people with untreated thyroid disease may have a higher risk of birth defects compared with babies born to mothers who do not have thyroid disease.Infants with hypothyroidism present at birth that goes untreated are at risk of serious physical and mental development problems. But if the condition is diagnosed within the first few months of life, the chances of typical development are excellent.",

Examples include obesity, diabetes and irregular ovulation patterns, which might happen in polycystic ovary syndrome. Taking hormone therapy medicine that contains estrogen but not progestin after menopause increases the risk of endometrial cancer.A rare type of ovarian tumor that gives off estrogen also can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.",

      "Heart issues, such as problems with the structure of the heart and vessels, or a heart murmur and bluish skin because of poor circulation of blood, also known as cyanosis.",
      "Frequent infections.",
      "Distinctive facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, ears that look different, wide-set eyes, hooded eyes and an enlarged nose tip. Asymmetric crying facies also may be present. This is when muscles on one side of the mouth don't develop fully, causing that side of the mouth to droop when crying, though the face looks balanced at rest.",

      "Healthcare professionals may suspect 22q11.2 deletion syndrome:",
      "At birth.If a severe heart problem, cleft palate or other signs typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are clear at birth, tests likely will be done before your child leaves the hospital.",
      "At well-baby visits.Illnesses or conditions that are typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may become clear over time. Your child's healthcare professional may see issues during regularly scheduled well-baby visits or annual checkups."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Each person has two copies of chromosome 22 — one inherited from each parent. If a person has DiGeorge syndrome, one copy of chromosome 22 is missing a segment that includes an estimated 30 to 40 genes. Many of these genes haven't been clearly identified and aren't well understood. The region of chromosome 22 that's deleted is known as 22q11.2.",
      "The deletion of genes from chromosome 22 usually occurs as a random event in the father's sperm or in the mother's egg. Or it may occur early when the baby is developing. Rarely, the deletion is passed to a child from a parent who also has a deletion in chromosome 22 but may have fewer or mild symptoms."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Babies who are missing a portion of chromosome 22, specifically a region known as 22q11.2, are most at risk of DiGeorge syndrome. This missing portion causes several body systems to develop poorly."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "The portions of chromosome 22 missing in DiGeorge syndrome affect the development of several body systems. As a result, the condition can cause several errors during fetal development.",
      "Heart issues.22q11.2 deletion syndrome often causes heart problems that could lead to too little oxygen-rich blood. For example, problems may include a hole between the lower chambers of the heart, also known as a ventricular septal defect. Or there may be only one large vessel rather than two vessels leading out of the heart, also known as truncus arteriosus. Or there may be four problems with heart structure, also known as tetralogy of Fallot.",
      "Hypoparathyroidism.The four parathyroid glands in the neck regulate the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can cause parathyroid glands to be smaller than usual and produce too little parathyroid hormone. This leads to hypoparathyroidism. This condition results in low levels of calcium and high levels of phosphorus in the blood.",
      "Thymus gland dysfunction.The thymus gland, which is beneath the breastbone, is where T cells — a type of white blood cell — mature. Mature T cells help fight infections. In children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, the thymus gland may be small or missing. This leads to poor immune function and frequent, severe infections.",
      "Cleft palate.A common condition of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a cleft palate, which is an opening in the roof of the mouth, with or without a cleft lip. Other, less visible problems with the structure of the palate can make it hard to swallow or make certain sounds in speech.",
      "Distinct facial features.A number of particular facial features may be present in some people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. These may include small, low-set ears, short width of eye openings (palpebral fissures), hooded eyes, a relatively long face, an enlarged nose tip (bulbous), or a short or flattened groove in the upper lip.",
      "Learning, behavioral and mental health problems.22q11.2 deletion syndrome may cause problems with development and function of the brain, resulting in learning, social, developmental or behavioral problems. Delays in toddler speech development and finding it hard to learn are common. Some children develop attention-deficit/hyperactivity condition (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder. Later in life, the risk of depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions is higher.",
      "Autoimmune conditions.People with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome also may have a greater risk of getting autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Graves' disease.",

      "There are two main types of vesicoureteral reflux, and they have different causes.",
      "Primary vesicoureteral reflux.Children are born with this more common type of reflux. It's caused by a problem with the valve that usually keeps urine from flowing backward from the bladder. The valve doesn't close well. This lets urine flow back up tubes called ureters that carry urine from the kidneys down to the bladder.As children grow, the ureters lengthen and straighten. That may help the valve work better and correct the backflow of urine over time. This type of vesicoureteral reflux tends to run in families. So it may be genetic. But the exact cause isn't known.",
      "Secondary vesicoureteral reflux.This type of reflux most often happens because the bladder doesn't empty properly. There can be many reasons for this. For example, a fold of tissue may block urine from fully leaving the bladder. Or muscles that connect the bladder to another tube called the urethra may become too narrow.

In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.",
