      "An aortic aneurysm is a bulge that occurs in the wall of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta carries blood from the heart to the body. Aortic aneurysms can occur anywhere in the aorta. They may be tube shaped or round.",
      "Aortic aneurysms include:",
      "Abdominal aortic aneurysm.This type occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the belly area.",
      "Thoracic aortic aneurysm.This type occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the chest cavity.",
      "Some people may have both types of aortic aneurysms.",
      "An aortic aneurysm increases the risk of a tear in the inner layer of the wall of the aorta. This tear is called anaortic dissection.",
      "Alberto Pochettino, M.D., Cardiovascular Surgery, Mayo Clinic:I'm Dr. Alberto Pochettino, a cardiovascular surgeon specializing in the treatment of aortic disease at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The easiest way for me to describe some of the surgical procedures I perform is to first look at the aorta itself. The aorta is a large vessel that carries blood from the heart to the entire body. At the simplest level, the aorta can be divided into four parts--the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, the descending thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta. The ascending aorta starts at the heart with the aortic root containing the aortic valve and the origin of the coronary arteries. The tubular ascending aorta is next and travels to the base of the neck. There the aorta arches back to the spine. Along the aortic arch, three branch vessels come off, carrying blood to the brain and the arms. From the aortic arch, the descending thoracic aorta travels downward along the spine. When it crosses the diaphragm, the muscle that divides the chest from the abdomen, the name changes to abdominal aorta. At the pelvis, the aorta divides and becomes the iliac arteries.",
      "The main disease that I see is aortic aneurysm. An aneurysm is an enlargement of the aorta and as the aorta enlarges, it becomes thinner. The thinner it is, the more likely it is to rupture, which is much like an over inflated balloon that is at high risk of popping. Another aortic disease, which often occurs in the presence of aortic aneurysms, is called aortic dissection. The aorta has three layers--a thin inside layer, which prevents blood from clotting; a muscular middle layer, which provides the structural integrity of the vessel; and a tough fibrous outside layer, which holds everything in place. Dissection is a process where the inner layer of the aorta tears. Blood is forced inside the middle muscular layer which is torn apart. This forms a new channel called the false lumen as opposed to the true lumen, which is the passage to which the aorta should be carrying blood. As blood continues to flow into the false lumen, the false lumen grows until it reaches a branch vessel. At which point, the tissue may tear, connecting the true and false lumen or the false lumen may compress the branch vessel cutting off blood flow through that vessel. The implication of compromised blood flow take on a high degree of urgency when you consider that the vessel branching for the aorta can feed organs such as the heart, the brain, kidneys, liver and intestine. Compromise to these vessels can lead to heart attacks, strokes and organ failure. Finally, if the aortic valve is compromised by the dissection, it results in acute heart failure. The nature of the aortic dissection alone weakens the aortic wall putting it at risk for rupture. Thus, a dissection, which involves the ascending aorta, referred to as Type A dissection, always requires emergency surgery.",
      "Now why do these things happen? There are three players in the aortic disease game. The first is structural genetic abnormality. Basically, the aorta is built wrong. The classic genetic disease that lead to aortic aneurysm and dissection is Marfan syndrome. However, the most common genetic abnormality associated with ascending aortic aneurysm is bicuspid aortic valve. The second player is accelerated atherosclerotic injury. This can also be a genetic problem, but it just as often stems from sustained high blood pressure compounded by high cholesterol, smoking, obesity and sometimes diabetes. The least common player is inflammatory disease such as vasculitis or even infection.",
      "Now, how can a person prevent a catastrophic event like a dissection from occurring? If you have a family history of aortic disease or high blood pressure or if you have a heart murmur, a good starting point is an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound to the heart and the ascending aorta. If the echocardiogram suggests any aortic disease, it should be followed by aCTscan. Once an aneurysm has been identified, a decision must be made regarding when it is time for surgical intervention. An ascending aortic aneurysm greater than 5.5 centimeters requires surgery for all patients. In the presence of bicuspid aortic valve, the criteria for surgery is five centimeters. In the presence of genetic abnormalities, such as Marfan, an aneurysm of 4.5 centimeters would indicate surgery. An aneurysm in an aorta is replaced by Dacron graft. At the level of the root, a normal aortic valve can be saved inside a Dacron conduit. This operation is called a valve-spearing root replacement. If the valve is abnormal, it can be replaced at the same time as the aorta. We need a biologic or a mechanical valve. A portion of the aortic arch often need to be replaced during ascending replacement. The aortic arch is particularly important because of the branch vessel that supply blood to the brain. Therefore, techniques to replace the aorta in this area must protect brain function. Moving to the descending thoracic aorta, the size indication for surgical replacement is between 5.5 and 6 centimeters. Replacement of the descending thoracic aorta can often be done with endovascular techniques with good results. Endovascular aneurysm repair involves placement of the Dacron graft which is advanced through a peripheral artery and held in place by a metal stent. Access to the peripheral artery is obtained through a small incision without needing to open the chest or the abdomen. The last and most complex aneurysms are those of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. They are called thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. The majority of these require open surgery where both the chest and the abdomen are entered to make the repair. The same size criteria of 5.5 to 6 centimeters apply. Techniques are employed to minimize the risk of paraplegia which can result from the thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic repair. Technology is in development to allow more of this complex aneurysm to be repaired in an endovascular fashion.",
      "In summary, techniques to repair all segments of the aorta in either open or endovascular fashion are available at the Mayo Clinic. A patient can be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team and any diseased portion of the aorta can be repaired.",

      "An aortic aneurysm is a bulge that occurs in the wall of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta carries blood from the heart to the body. Aortic aneurysms can occur anywhere in the aorta. They may be tube shaped or round.",
      "Aortic aneurysms include:",
      "Abdominal aortic aneurysm.This type occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the belly area.",
      "Thoracic aortic aneurysm.This type occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the chest cavity.",
      "Some people may have both types of aortic aneurysms.",
      "An aortic aneurysm increases the risk of a tear in the inner layer of the wall of the aorta. This tear is called anaortic dissection.",
      "Alberto Pochettino, M.D., Cardiovascular Surgery, Mayo Clinic:I'm Dr. Alberto Pochettino, a cardiovascular surgeon specializing in the treatment of aortic disease at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The easiest way for me to describe some of the surgical procedures I perform is to first look at the aorta itself. The aorta is a large vessel that carries blood from the heart to the entire body. At the simplest level, the aorta can be divided into four parts--the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, the descending thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta. The ascending aorta starts at the heart with the aortic root containing the aortic valve and the origin of the coronary arteries. The tubular ascending aorta is next and travels to the base of the neck. There the aorta arches back to the spine. Along the aortic arch, three branch vessels come off, carrying blood to the brain and the arms. From the aortic arch, the descending thoracic aorta travels downward along the spine. When it crosses the diaphragm, the muscle that divides the chest from the abdomen, the name changes to abdominal aorta. At the pelvis, the aorta divides and becomes the iliac arteries.",
      "The main disease that I see is aortic aneurysm. An aneurysm is an enlargement of the aorta and as the aorta enlarges, it becomes thinner. The thinner it is, the more likely it is to rupture, which is much like an over inflated balloon that is at high risk of popping. Another aortic disease, which often occurs in the presence of aortic aneurysms, is called aortic dissection. The aorta has three layers--a thin inside layer, which prevents blood from clotting; a muscular middle layer, which provides the structural integrity of the vessel; and a tough fibrous outside layer, which holds everything in place. Dissection is a process where the inner layer of the aorta tears. Blood is forced inside the middle muscular layer which is torn apart. This forms a new channel called the false lumen as opposed to the true lumen, which is the passage to which the aorta should be carrying blood. As blood continues to flow into the false lumen, the false lumen grows until it reaches a branch vessel. At which point, the tissue may tear, connecting the true and false lumen or the false lumen may compress the branch vessel cutting off blood flow through that vessel. The implication of compromised blood flow take on a high degree of urgency when you consider that the vessel branching for the aorta can feed organs such as the heart, the brain, kidneys, liver and intestine. Compromise to these vessels can lead to heart attacks, strokes and organ failure. Finally, if the aortic valve is compromised by the dissection, it results in acute heart failure. The nature of the aortic dissection alone weakens the aortic wall putting it at risk for rupture. Thus, a dissection, which involves the ascending aorta, referred to as Type A dissection, always requires emergency surgery.",
      "Now why do these things happen? There are three players in the aortic disease game. The first is structural genetic abnormality. Basically, the aorta is built wrong. The classic genetic disease that lead to aortic aneurysm and dissection is Marfan syndrome. However, the most common genetic abnormality associated with ascending aortic aneurysm is bicuspid aortic valve. The second player is accelerated atherosclerotic injury. This can also be a genetic problem, but it just as often stems from sustained high blood pressure compounded by high cholesterol, smoking, obesity and sometimes diabetes. The least common player is inflammatory disease such as vasculitis or even infection.",
      "Now, how can a person prevent a catastrophic event like a dissection from occurring? If you have a family history of aortic disease or high blood pressure or if you have a heart murmur, a good starting point is an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound to the heart and the ascending aorta. If the echocardiogram suggests any aortic disease, it should be followed by aCTscan. Once an aneurysm has been identified, a decision must be made regarding when it is time for surgical intervention. An ascending aortic aneurysm greater than 5.5 centimeters requires surgery for all patients. In the presence of bicuspid aortic valve, the criteria for surgery is five centimeters. In the presence of genetic abnormalities, such as Marfan, an aneurysm of 4.5 centimeters would indicate surgery. An aneurysm in an aorta is replaced by Dacron graft. At the level of the root, a normal aortic valve can be saved inside a Dacron conduit. This operation is called a valve-spearing root replacement. If the valve is abnormal, it can be replaced at the same time as the aorta. We need a biologic or a mechanical valve. A portion of the aortic arch often need to be replaced during ascending replacement. The aortic arch is particularly important because of the branch vessel that supply blood to the brain. Therefore, techniques to replace the aorta in this area must protect brain function. Moving to the descending thoracic aorta, the size indication for surgical replacement is between 5.5 and 6 centimeters. Replacement of the descending thoracic aorta can often be done with endovascular techniques with good results. Endovascular aneurysm repair involves placement of the Dacron graft which is advanced through a peripheral artery and held in place by a metal stent. Access to the peripheral artery is obtained through a small incision without needing to open the chest or the abdomen. The last and most complex aneurysms are those of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. They are called thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. The majority of these require open surgery where both the chest and the abdomen are entered to make the repair. The same size criteria of 5.5 to 6 centimeters apply. Techniques are employed to minimize the risk of paraplegia which can result from the thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic repair. Technology is in development to allow more of this complex aneurysm to be repaired in an endovascular fashion.",
      "In summary, techniques to repair all segments of the aorta in either open or endovascular fashion are available at the Mayo Clinic. A patient can be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team and any diseased portion of the aorta can be repaired.",

      "Benign tumors can occur in nerves, muscle and bone. This illustration shows a schwannoma of the tibial nerve in the leg.",
      "Surgeons carefully remove schwannomas while taking care to preserve nerve fascicles that aren't affected by the tumors. Nerve fascicles are bundles of nerve fibers.",
      "Surgeons carefully remove schwannomas while taking care to preserve nerve fascicles that aren't affected by the tumors. Nerve fascicles are bundles of nerve fibers.",
      "A schwannoma is a type of nerve tumor of the nerve sheath. It's the most common type of benign peripheral nerve tumor in adults. It can occur anywhere in your body, at any age.",
      "A schwannoma typically comes from a single bundle (fascicle) within the main nerve and displaces the rest of the nerve. When a schwannoma grows larger, more fascicles are affected, making removal more difficult. In general, a schwannoma grows slowly.",
      "If you develop a schwannoma in an arm or leg, you may notice a painless lump. Schwannomas are rarely cancerous, but they can lead to nerve damage and loss of muscle control. See your doctor if you have any unusual lumps or numbness.",
      "To diagnose a schwannoma, your doctor may ask you about signs and symptoms, discuss your medical history, and perform both a general physical and neurological exam. If signs suggest that you could have a schwannoma or other nerve tumor, your doctor may recommend one or more of these diagnostic tests:",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).This scan uses a magnet and radio waves to produce a detailed, 3-D view of your nerves and surrounding tissue.",
      "Computerized tomography (CT).A CT scanner rotates around your body to record a series of images. A computer uses the images to make a detailed view of your growth so that your doctor can evaluate how it may be affecting you.",
      "Electromyogram (EMG).For this test, your doctor places small needles in your muscles so an electromyography instrument can record the electrical activity in your muscle as you try to move it.",
      "Nerve conduction study.You're likely to have this test along with your EMG. It measures how quickly your nerves carry electrical signals to your muscles.",
      "Tumor biopsy.If imaging tests identify a nerve tumor, your doctor may remove and analyze a small sample of cells (biopsy) from your tumor. Depending on the tumor's size and location, you may need local or general anesthesia during the biopsy.",
      "Nerve biopsy.If you have a condition such as progressive peripheral neuropathy or enlarged nerves that mimic nerve tumors, your doctor may take a nerve biopsy.",
      "Schwannoma treatment depends on where the abnormal growth is located and whether it is causing pain or growing quickly. Treatment options include:",
      "Monitoring.Your doctor may suggest observing your condition over time. Observation may include regular checkups and a CT or MRI scan every few months to see if your tumor is growing.",
      "Surgery.An experienced peripheral nerve surgeon can remove the tumor if it is causing pain or growing quickly. Schwannoma surgery is done under general anesthesia. Depending on the location of the tumor, some patients can go home the day of surgery. Others may need to stay in the hospital for one or two days. Even after successful removal of the tumor during surgery, a tumor may recur.",
      "Radiation therapy.Radiation therapy is used to help control the tumor growth and improve your symptoms. It may be used in combination with surgery.",
      "Stereotactic radiosurgery.If the tumor is near vital nerves or blood vessels, a technique called stereotactic body radiation therapy may be used to limit damage to healthy tissue. With this technique, doctors deliver radiation precisely to a tumor without making an incision.",
