These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called \"blackouts,\" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death.",
      "Alcohol withdrawalcan occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations."

    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or your drinking is causing problems, or if your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your health care provider. Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health professional or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group.",

      "The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called theAVnode, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers.",
      "In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute.",
      "But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. TheAVnode is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm.",

      "Drinking too much alcohol.Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.",
      "Changes in the level of body minerals.Minerals in the blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium — help the heart beat. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur.",
      "Family history.An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families.",
      "Heart problems or heart surgery.Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk ofAFib. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition.",
      "High blood pressure.Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart.",
      "Obesity.People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.",
      "Other long-term health conditions.You may be more likely to getAFibif you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea.",
      "Some medicines and supplements.Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats.",

It's often recommended if something concerning is found on a mammogram or an ultrasound. A biopsy also might be done to investigate a breast concern, such as a lump."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "It's not clear what causes atypical hyperplasia of the breast.",
      "Atypical hyperplasia of the breast happens when cells in the breast tissue develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes tell the cell to make many more cells. This causes a buildup of cells in the breast. Healthcare professionals call this buildup hyperplasia. The changes also turn the cells into atypical cells. This means that the cells look different from typical cells.",
      "Atypical hyperplasia is thought to be a very early step in the process that turns healthy cells into cancer cells. In theory, if atypical hyperplasia cells are allowed to continue growing, they could get more DNA changes and become cancer cells. More research is needed to understand how this happens.",
      "Atypical hyperplasia can happen in the breast ducts or the breast lobules:",
      "Atypical ductal hyperplasiadescribes a growth of atypical cells within the breast ducts. The breast ducts are tubes that can carry breast milk to the nipple. This type of atypical hyperplasia is most common.",
      "Atypical lobular hyperplasiadescribes a growth of atypical cells within the breast lobules. The breast lobules are glands that can make breast milk. This type of atypical hyperplasia is less common.",
      "Both types of atypical hyperplasia increase the risk of breast cancer. Treatment for both types is similar."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "There are no specific risk factors for atypical hyperplasia of the breast. Atypical hyperplasia is one of several conditions that cause a growth of cells in the breast that isn't cancerous. These conditions are sometimes called benign breast diseases. Healthcare professionals have found risk factors for benign breast diseases. They include:",
      "A family history of breast cancer.If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of being diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia of the breast or another benign breast disease before menopause is increased.",
      "Menopausal hormone therapy.Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of atypical hyperplasia and other benign breast diseases."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "If you've been diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia of the breast, you have an increased risk of getting breast cancer in the future. The risk of breast cancer in those with atypical hyperplasia is about four times higher than in those who don't have atypical hyperplasia. The risk is similar for atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia.",
      "Studies of women with atypical hyperplasia have found that the risk of breast cancer increases over time. At 25 years after diagnosis, about 30% of women with atypical hyperplasia may have breast cancer. Put another way, for every 100 women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, 30 can be expected to have breast cancer 25 years after diagnosis. And 70 will not develop breast cancer."

Balanced vaginal flora help keep the vagina healthy. Usually \"good\" bacteria outnumber \"bad\" bacteria. The good bacteria are called lactobacilli; the bad bacteria are anaerobes.

    "Symptoms": [
      "Symptoms of a brachial plexus injury can differ depending on how serious the injury is and where it's located. Usually only one arm is affected."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Brachial plexus injuries in the upper nerves happen when the shoulder is forced down on one side of the body and the head is pushed to the other side in the opposite direction. The lower nerves are more likely to be injured when the arm is forced above the head.",
      "These injuries can happen in many ways, including:",
      "Contact sports.Many football players have burners or stingers. These are caused when the brachial plexus nerves get stretched past their limit during clashes with other players.",
      "Birth.Newborns can have brachial plexus injuries. This is more common in babies with a high birth weight, a very long labor and a bottom-first, also called breech, presentation. If a baby's shoulders get stuck in the birth canal, brachial plexus palsy is more likely. Most often, the upper nerves are injured. This is called Erb palsy.",
      "Injuries.Many injuries — including those from motor vehicle accidents, motorcycle accidents, falls or bullet wounds — can damage the brachial plexus.",
      "Tumors and cancer treatments.Tumors can grow on their own. Rarely, they can form because of a health condition, such as neurofibromatosis, or after radiation treatment."

    "Risk factors": [
      "Playing contact sports, especially football and wrestling, or being in high-speed motor vehicle accidents increases the risk of brachial plexus injury."

    "Complications": [
      "Many mild brachial plexus injuries heal over time with few to no issues. But some injuries can cause short-term or lasting problems, such as:",
      "Stiff joints.If you have hand or arm paralysis, the joints can get stiff. This can make it hard to move, even if you are able to use your hand or arm again. For that reason, your healthcare professional may suggest ongoing physical therapy during your recovery.",
      "Pain.This is caused by nerve damage and may be lifelong.",
      "Numbness.If you lose feeling in the arm or hand, you're at risk of burning or injuring yourself without knowing it.",
      "Muscle atrophy.Nerves regrow slowly and can take many years to heal after injury. During that time, not using your muscles may cause them to break down.",
      "Permanent disability.How well you recover from a serious brachial plexus injury depends on many things, such as your age and the type, location and seriousness of the injury. Even with surgery, some people have muscle weakness or paralysis that lasts for the rest of their lives."

The risk of bleeding may be higher for certain types of AVM. Risk also may be higher in people who have had a brain AVM bleed in the past.Although studies haven't found that pregnancy increases the risk of hemorrhage in people with a brain AVM, more research is needed.Some hemorrhages associated with brain AVMs aren't detected because they cause no major symptoms. However, potentially dangerous bleeding can occur.Brain AVMs account for about 2% of all hemorrhagic strokes each year. In children and young adults who experience brain hemorrhage, brain AVMs are often the cause.",
      "Reduced oxygen to brain tissue.With a brain AVM, blood doesn't flow through the network of small blood vessels called capillaries. Instead, it flows directly from arteries to veins. Blood rushes quickly because it isn't slowed by the smaller blood vessels.Surrounding brain tissue can't easily absorb oxygen from the fast-flowing blood. Without enough oxygen, brain tissues weaken or may die off completely. This results in stroke-like symptoms, such as trouble speaking, weakness, numbness, vision loss or trouble staying steady.",
      "Thin or weak blood vessels.An AVM puts extreme pressure on the thin and weak walls of the blood vessels. A bulge in a blood vessel wall, known as an aneurysm, may form. The aneurysm may be at risk of bursting.",

      "One type of brain AVM that involves a major blood vessel called the vein of Galen causes serious complications in babies. Symptoms are present at birth or appear soon after birth. This type of brain AVM causes fluid to build up in the brain and the head to swell. Swollen veins may be seen on the scalp, and seizures may occur.

As a result, the heart has trouble pumping blood to the rest of the body.This type can affect people of all ages. But it happens most often in people younger than 50 and is more likely to affect men. Conditions that can lead to a dilated heart include coronary artery disease and heart attack. But for some people, gene changes play a role in the disease.",

    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Complications of cirrhosis can include:",
      "High blood pressure in the veins that supply the liver.This condition is known as portal hypertension. Cirrhosis slows the regular flow of blood through the liver. This increases pressure in the vein that brings blood to the liver.",
      "Swelling in the legs and belly.The increased pressure in the portal vein can cause fluid to build up in the legs, called edema, and in the belly, called ascites. Edema and ascites also may happen if the liver can't make enough of certain blood proteins, such as albumin.",
      "Swelling of the spleen.Portal hypertension can cause the spleen to trap white blood cells and platelets. This makes the spleen swell, a condition known as splenomegaly. Fewer white blood cells and platelets in your blood can be the first sign of cirrhosis.",
      "Bleeding.Portal hypertension can cause blood to be redirected to smaller veins. Strained by the extra pressure, these smaller veins can burst, causing serious bleeding. Portal hypertension also may cause enlarged veins, called varices (VAIR-uh-seez), in the esophagus or the stomach. These varices also may lead to life-threatening bleeding. If the liver can't make enough clotting factors, this also can contribute to continued bleeding.",
      "Infections.Having cirrhosis makes it hard for the body to fight infections. Ascites also can lead to bacterial peritonitis, a serious infection.",
      "Malnutrition.Cirrhosis may make it more difficult for the body to process nutrients, leading to weakness and weight loss.",
      "Buildup of toxins in the brain.A liver damaged by cirrhosis can't clear toxins from the blood as well as a healthy liver can. These toxins can then build up in the brain and cause mental confusion and difficulty concentrating. This is known as hepatic encephalopathy. With time, hepatic encephalopathy can progress to unresponsiveness or coma.",
      "Jaundice.Jaundice happens when the diseased liver doesn't remove enough bilirubin, a blood waste product, from the blood. Jaundice causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes and darkening of urine.",

    "Causes": [
      "The most common cause ofCAHis the lack of the enzyme protein known as 21-hydroxylase. Sometimes,CAHis called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The body needs this enzyme to make proper amounts of hormones. Very rarely, a lack of other much rarer enzymes also can causeCAH.",
      "CAHis a genetic condition. That means it's passed from parents to children. It's present at birth. Children with the condition have two parents who both carry the genetic change that causesCAH. Or they have two parents who haveCAHthemselves. This is known as the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.",
      "People can carry theCAHgene and not have symptoms of the condition. This is called being a silent carrier. If a silent carrier becomes pregnant, that person can pass the gene to a child. If tests show that you're a silent carrier of theCAHgene and you have a partner of the opposite sex, talk with your healthcare professional. It's likely that your partner will need to get tested for theCAHgene before pregnancy so that you can better understand the risks."

      "Chest pain, called angina.You may feel squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. The chest pain usually affects the middle or left side of the chest. Activity or strong emotions can trigger angina. There are different types of angina. The type depends on the cause and whether rest or medicine makes symptoms better. In some people, especially women, the pain may be brief or sharp and felt in the neck, arm or back.",
      "Shortness of breath.You may feel like you can't catch your breath.",
      "Fatigue. If the heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may feel unusually tired.",
      "Symptoms of coronary artery disease may not be noticed at first. Sometimes symptoms only happen when the heart is beating hard, such as during exercise. As the coronary arteries continue to narrow, symptoms can get more severe or frequent.",
      "A completely blocked coronary artery will cause a heart attack. Common heart attack symptoms include:",

For example, they may have nausea or a very brief pain in the neck or back. Some people having a heart attack don't notice symptoms."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Coronary artery disease is caused by the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the walls of the heart arteries. This condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup is called plaque. Plaque can cause the arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow. The plaque also can burst, causing a blood clot.",
      "Some causes of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease are:",
      "Diabetes or insulin resistance.",
      "High blood pressure.",
      "Lack of exercise.",
      "Smoking or tobacco use."

    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you think you're having a heart attack, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only as a last option.",
      "Smoking or having high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity or a strong family history of heart disease makes you more likely to get coronary artery disease. If you're at high risk of coronary artery disease, talk to your healthcare professional. You may need tests to check for narrowed arteries and coronary artery disease."

      "Birth sex.Men are generally at greater risk of coronary artery disease. However, the risk for women increases after menopause.",
      "Family history.A family history of heart disease makes you more likely to get coronary artery disease. This is especially true if a parent, brother, sister or child got heart disease at an early age. The risk is highest if your father or a brother had heart disease before age 55 or if your mother or a sister developed it before age 65.",
      "Coronary artery disease risk factors you can control are:",
      "Smoking.If you smoke, quit. Smoking is bad for heart health. People who smoke have a much greater risk of heart disease. Breathing in secondhand smoke also increases the risk.",
      "High blood pressure.Uncontrolled high blood pressure can make arteries hard and stiff. This can lead to atherosclerosis, which causes coronary artery disease.",
      "Cholesterol.Too much \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood can increase the risk of atherosclerosis. \"Bad\" cholesterol is called low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Not enough \"good\" cholesterol, called high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also leads to atherosclerosis.",
      "Diabetes.Diabetes increases the risk of coronary artery disease. Type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease share some risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.",
      "Obesity.Too much body fat is bad for overall health. Obesity can lead to type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Ask your healthcare team what a healthy weight is for you.",
      "Chronic kidney disease.Having long-term kidney disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease.",
      "Not getting enough exercise.Physical activity is important for good health. A lack of exercise is linked to coronary artery disease and some of its risk factors.",
      "A lot of stress. Emotional stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for coronary artery disease.",
      "Unhealthy diet.Eating foods with a lot of saturated fat, trans fat, salt and sugar can increase the risk of coronary artery disease.",
      "Alcohol use.Heavy alcohol use can lead to heart muscle damage. It also can worsen other risk factors of coronary artery disease.",
      "Amount of sleep.Too little sleep and too much sleep both have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease.",
      "Risk factors often happen together. One risk factor may trigger another. When grouped together, some risk factors make you even more likely to develop coronary artery disease. For example, metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that includes high blood pressure, high blood sugar, too much body fat around the waist and high triglyceride levels. Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of coronary artery disease.",
      "Other possible risk factors for coronary artery disease may include:",
      "Breathing pauses during sleep, called obstructive sleep apnea.This condition causes breathing to stop and start during sleep. It can cause sudden drops in blood oxygen levels. The heart must work harder to pump blood. Blood pressure goes up.",
      "Increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).This protein appears in higher than usual amounts when there's inflammation somewhere in the body. High hs-CRP levels may be a risk factor for heart disease. It's thought that as coronary arteries narrow, the level of hs-CRP in the blood goes up.",
      "High triglycerides.This is a type of fat in the blood. High levels may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially for women.",
      "High levels of homocysteine.Homocysteine is a substance that the body uses to make protein and to build and maintain tissue. But high levels of homocysteine may raise the risk of coronary artery disease.",
      "Preeclampsia.This pregnancy complication causes high blood pressure and increased protein in the urine. It can lead to a higher risk of heart disease later in life.",

      "Pain or drainage near or around the anus due to inflammation from a tunnel into the skin, called a fistula.",
      "Crohn's disease can affect any part of the small or large intestine. It may involve multiple segments, or it may be continuous. It most commonly involves the last part of the small intestine. In some people, the disease is only in the colon or the large intestine.",
      "Symptoms of Crohn's disease can range from mild to severe. They usually develop gradually, but sometimes might come on suddenly, without warning. Someone with Crohn's disease also may have periods of time with no symptoms. This is known as remission."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "The exact cause of Crohn's disease remains unknown. Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now healthcare professionals know that these factors may aggravate, but don't cause, Crohn's disease. Several factors likely play a role in its development.",
      "Genes.More than 200 genes have been associated with Crohn's disease. However, researchers aren't exactly sure what role they play in the condition. Having one or more of these genes may make someone more likely to get Crohn's disease.",
      "Immune system.It's possible that bacteria, viruses or other environmental factors may trigger Crohn's disease. For example, certain bacteria in the gut microbiome are suspected to be associated with Crohn's disease, but it is unknown if these bacteria cause Crohn's disease. When the immune system tries to fight off an invading microorganism or environmental triggers, an atypical immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too."

      "Diarrhea lasting more than two weeks.",
      "Losing weight without trying.",
      "Fever in addition to any of the above symptoms."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Risk factors for Crohn's disease may include:",
      "Family history.People with a first-degree relative, such as a parent, sibling or child, are at higher risk to have the disease. As many as 1 in 5 people with Crohn's disease has a family member with the disease.",
      "Age.Crohn's disease can happen at any age, but it's more common to develop the condition when you're young. Most people who develop Crohn's disease are diagnosed before they're around 30 years old.",
      "Ethnicity.Although Crohn's disease can affect any ethnic group, white people have the highest risk, especially people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent. However, the incidence of Crohn's disease is increasing among Black people who live in North America and the United Kingdom. Crohn's disease also is being increasingly seen in the Middle Eastern population and among migrants to the United States.",
      "Cigarette smoking.Cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing Crohn's disease. Smoking also leads to more-serious disease and a greater risk of having surgery. If you smoke, it's important to stop.",
      "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines.These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), diclofenac sodium and others. While they do not cause Crohn's disease, they can lead to inflammation of the bowel that makes Crohn's disease worse."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Crohn's disease may lead to one or more of the following complications:",
      "Bowel blockage or obstruction.Crohn's disease can affect the entire thickness of the intestinal wall. Over time, parts of the bowel can scar and narrow, which may block the flow of digestive contents, often known as a stricture. Surgery to widen the stricture or to remove the diseased portion of the bowel may be necessary.",
      "Ulcers.Ongoing inflammation can lead to open sores called ulcers anywhere in the digestive tract. This can include the mouth, anus and genital area.",
      "Fistulas.Sometimes ulcers can extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating a connection between different body parts that shouldn't be there. This is known as a fistula. Fistulas can develop between the intestine and the skin, or between the intestine and another organ. Fistulas near or around the anal area are the most common kind.When fistulas develop inside the abdomen, it may lead to infections and collections of pus called abscesses. This can be life-threatening if not treated. Fistulas may form between loops of bowel, in the bladder or vagina, or through the skin, causing continuous drainage of bowel contents to the skin.",
      "Anal fissure.This is a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus or in the skin around the anus where infections can occur. It's often associated with painful stool and may lead to a fistula.",
      "Malnutrition.Diarrhea, belly pain and cramping may make it difficult to eat or for the intestine to absorb enough nutrients. It's also common to develop anemia due to low iron or vitamin B-12 caused by the disease.",
      "Colon cancer.Having Crohn's disease that affects the colon increases the risk of colon cancer. General colon cancer screening guidelines for people without Crohn's disease call for a colonoscopy at least every 10 years beginning at age 45.In people with Crohn's disease affecting a large part of the colon, a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer is recommended about eight years after disease onset and generally is performed every 1 to 2 years afterward. Ask a healthcare professional whether you need to have this test done sooner and more frequently.",
      "Skin disorders.Many people with Crohn's disease also may develop a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. This skin disorder involves deep nodules, tunnels and abscesses in the armpits, groin, under the breasts, and in the perianal or genital area. Some Crohn's disease treatments also increase the risk of skin cancers, so a routine skin examination is recommended.",
      "Other health problems.Crohn's disease also can cause problems in other parts of the body. Among these problems are low iron, called anemia, osteoporosis, arthritis, kidney stones, eye problems, and gallbladder or liver disease.",
      "Medicine risks.Certain Crohn's disease medicines that block functions of the immune system are associated with a small risk of developing cancers, including lymphoma and skin cancers. They also increase the risk of infections.Corticosteroids can be associated with a risk of osteoporosis, bone fractures, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes and high blood pressure, among other conditions. Work with a healthcare professional to determine risks and benefits of medicines.",

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors — such as tobacco smoke.",

      "Chronic itchy, scaly skin.A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.",
      "Patches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area.This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.",

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Eisenmenger syndrome is usually caused by an unrepaired hole between the main blood vessels or chambers of the heart. The hole is called a shunt. A shunt is a heart problem present at birth, which means it's a congenital heart defect.",

      "Patent ductus arteriosus.This is an opening between the artery that carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs and the body's main artery.",
      "In any of these heart conditions, blood flows in a way it usually doesn't. As a result, pressure rises in the pulmonary artery. Over time, the increased pressure damages the smaller blood vessels in the lungs. The damaged blood vessel walls make it hard for the heart to pump blood to the lungs.",
      "In Eisenmenger syndrome, blood pressure rises in the side of the heart that has oxygen-poor blood, also called blue blood. The blue blood goes through the hole in the heart or blood vessels. Oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood now mix. This causes low blood oxygen levels."

      "Low blood oxygen levels.The change in blood flow through the heart sends less oxygen to the body's tissues and organs. Without quick treatment, the oxygen levels get worse.",
      "Irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias.Eisenmenger syndrome causes the heart walls to get bigger and thicker. It also causes a drop in oxygen levels. These changes may lead to irregular heartbeats. Some irregular heartbeats increase the risk of blood clots that can cause heart attacks or strokes.",
      "Sudden cardiac arrest.This is the sudden loss of heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. If not treated immediately, sudden cardiac arrest can quickly lead to death. Survival is possible with fast, proper medical care.",
      "Heart failure.The increased pressure in the heart can cause the heart muscle to weaken. It becomes harder for the heart to pump blood.",

      "Emphysema is one of the two common types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The other common type is chronic bronchitis. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the tubes that carry air to your lungs, called bronchial tubes, become irritated and swollen. This inflammation limits the space for air to move in and out of the lungs and makes extra mucus that blocks the airways. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis often occur together, so the general term COPD may be used."

AAT is made in the liver and is passed into the bloodstream to help protect the lungs from damage caused by smoke, fumes and dust. Low levels of AAT, a condition called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, can cause liver damage, lung conditions such as emphysema or both. With AAT deficiency, there is usually a family history of emphysema, and symptoms begin at a younger age."

      "Being around secondhand smoke.Secondhand smoke is smoke that you breathe in from someone else's cigarette, pipe or cigar. Being around secondhand smoke raises your risk of emphysema.",
      "Job exposure to fumes, vapors or dust.If you breathe in fumes or vapors from certain chemicals or dust from grain, cotton, wood or mining products, you're more likely to develop emphysema. This risk is even greater if you also smoke.",
      "Exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution.Breathing indoor pollutants, such as fumes from heating fuel, as well as outdoor pollutants, such as smog or car exhaust, increases your risk of emphysema.",

    ],
    "Complications": [
      "People who have emphysema are more likely to develop:",
      "High blood pressure in lung arteries.Emphysema may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to the lungs. This serious condition is called pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can cause the right side of the heart to expand and weaken, a condition called cor pulmonale.",
      "Other heart problems.For reasons that aren't fully understood, emphysema can raise your risk of heart disease, including heart attack.",
      "Large air spaces in the lungs.Large air spaces called bullae form in the lungs when the inner walls of the alveoli are destroyed. This leaves one very large air sac instead of a cluster of many smaller ones. These bullae can become very large, even as large as half the lung. The bullae lessen the space available for the lung to expand. Also, giant bullae can increase the risk of a collapsed lung.",
      "Collapsed lung.A collapsed lung called pneumothorax can be life-threatening in people who have severe emphysema because their lungs are already damaged. This is not common but it's serious when it happens.",
      "Lung cancer.People with emphysema have a higher risk of getting lung cancer. Smoking raises this risk even more.",

Sometimes autoimmune encephalitis can be triggered by cancerous or noncancerous tumors, known as paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system. Other types of autoimmune encephalitis such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) can be triggered by an infection in the body. This is known as post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis.

    "Causes": [
      "Eosinophils are a typical type of white blood cells present in your digestive tract. However, in eosinophilic esophagitis, you have an allergic reaction to an outside substance. The reaction may occur as follows:",
      "Reaction of the esophagus.The lining of your esophagus reacts to allergens, such as food or pollen.",
      "Multiplication of eosinophils.The eosinophils multiply in your esophagus and produce a protein that causes inflammation.",
      "Damage to the esophagus.Inflammation can lead to scarring, narrowing and formation of excessive fibrous tissue in the lining of your esophagus.",
      "Dysphagia and impaction.You may have difficulty swallowing, called dysphagia. Or food may become stuck when you swallow. This is known as impaction.",
      "Additional symptoms.You may have other symptoms, such as chest pain or stomach pain.",
      "There has been a significant increase in numbers of people diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in the past decade. At first, researchers thought this was due to an increase in awareness among health care providers and greater availability of tests. However, studies now suggest that the disease is becoming increasingly common, parallel to the increase in asthma and allergies."

      "Climate.People who live in a cold or dry climate are more likely than those in other climates to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis.",
      "Season.You're more likely to be diagnosed between the spring and fall, probably because levels of pollen and other allergens are higher and people are more likely to be outdoors.",
      "Sex.Eosinophilic esophagitis is more common in males than in females.",
      "Family history.Researchers think that eosinophilic esophagitis may have a genetic component because the condition sometimes runs in families. If your family members have eosinophilic esophagitis, you have a greater chance of being diagnosed.",
      "Allergies and asthma.If you have food or environmental allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis, or a chronic respiratory disease, you're more likely to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis.",
      "Age.Originally, eosinophilic esophagitis was thought to be a childhood disease, but now it is known to be common in adults as well. The symptoms differ somewhat between children and adults."

      "Usually epidermolysis bullosa blisters are noticed during infancy. But it's not uncommon for them to appear when a toddler first begins to walk or when an older child begins new activities that cause more friction on the soles of the feet."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Epidermolysis bullosa is caused by an inherited gene. You may inherit the disease gene from one parent who has the disease (autosomal dominant inheritance) or from both parents (autosomal recessive inheritance).",
      "The skin is made up of an outer layer (epidermis) and an underlying layer (dermis). The area where the layers meet is called the basement membrane. The types of epidermolysis bullosa are mainly defined by which layers separate and form blisters. The skin injury might be brought on by a minor injury, bump or nothing at all.",
      "The main types of epidermolysis bullosa are:",
      "Epidermolysis bullosa simplex.This is the most common type. It's brought on by heat and friction and develops in the outer layer of skin. It mainly affects the palms and feet. The blisters heal without scarring.",
      "Junctional epidermolysis bullosa.This type may be severe, with blisters beginning in infancy. A baby with this condition may develop a hoarse-sounding cry from continual blistering and scarring of the vocal cords.",
      "Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.This type is related to a flaw in the gene that helps produce a protein that glues the skin layers together. If this protein is missing or doesn't function, the layers of the skin won't join properly. It can cause skin that looks thin. Diseased mucous membranes can cause constipation and make it hard to eat.",
      "Kindler syndrome.This type tends to cause blisters in multiple layers and so can look very different from person to person. The blisters tend to show up in infancy or early childhood. It increases sun sensitivity and causes skin to look thin, mottled and wrinkly.",

      "Fusion of fingers and changes in the joints.Severe forms of epidermolysis bullosa can bind together fingers or toes and cause unusual bending of the joints (contractures). This can affect the function of the fingers, knees and elbows.",
      "Problems with nutrition.Blisters in the mouth can make eating difficult and lead to malnutrition and anemia, such as low iron levels in the blood. Problems with nutrition can also cause delayed wound healing and slowed growth in children.",
      "Constipation.Difficulty passing stool may be due to painful blisters in the anal area. It can also be caused by not ingesting enough liquids or high-fiber foods, such as fruits and vegetables.",
      "Dental problems.Tooth decay and problems with tissues inside the mouth are common with some types of epidermolysis bullosa.",
      "Skin cancer.Teenagers and adults with certain types of epidermolysis bullosa are at increased risk of a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.",
      "Death.Infants with severe junctional epidermolysis bullosa are at high risk of infections and loss of body fluids from widespread blistering. Blisters in the mouth and throat also make it harder to eat and breathe. Many of these infants don't survive."

      "The more you drink while pregnant, the greater the risk to your unborn baby. But any amount of alcohol puts your baby at risk. Your baby's brain, heart and blood vessels begin to develop in the early weeks of pregnancy, before you may know you're pregnant.",
      "During the first three months of pregnancy, important stages of development happen with the face and organs such as the heart, bones, brain and nerves. Drinking alcohol during this time can cause damage to how body parts develop. And as the baby continues to develop in the womb, it's damaging to drink at any time during pregnancy."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you are pregnant and can't stop drinking alcohol, ask your obstetrician, primary care doctor or other healthcare professional for help. You also may choose to talk to a mental health professional. A social worker can direct you to community programs that offer help, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous.",
      "Because early diagnosis may help lessen the risk of some challenges for children with fetal alcohol syndrome, let your child's healthcare professional know if you drank alcohol while you were pregnant. Don't wait for your child to have issues before seeking help.",
      "If you adopted a child or are providing foster care, you may not know if the biological mother drank alcohol while pregnant. International adoption from some countries may have a higher rate of alcohol use by pregnant mothers. If you have concerns about your child's learning or behavior, talk with your child's healthcare professional to find out what might be causing these problems."

    "Causes": [
      "Frontal lobe seizures can be caused by tumors, stroke, infection or traumatic injuries in the brain's frontal lobes.",

If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of the skin may look patchy. The affected area may sting, burn and swell. A fluid-filled blister may form 12 to 36 hours after rewarming. This stage also is called superficial frostbite.",
      "Deep frostbite.As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin and the tissues below. The affected skin turns white or blue-gray. Large blood blisters may appear 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. Weeks after the injury, tissue may turn black and hard as it dies."

    "Causes": [
      "Geographic atrophy is an eye condition that can occur in people with another eye condition called dry age-related macular degeneration. It causes gradual loss of vision in people, usually as they age. It affects parts of the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye.",

      "Limited range of motion.As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in your joint, causing the inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack. Urate crystals can form when you have high levels of uric acid in your blood. Your body produces uric acid when it breaks down purines — substances that are found naturally in your body.",
      "Purines are also found in certain foods, including red meat and organ meats, such as liver. Purine-rich seafood includes anchovies, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout and tuna. Alcoholic beverages, especially beer, and drinks sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose) promote higher levels of uric acid.",
      "Normally, uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine. But sometimes either your body produces too much uric acid or your kidneys excrete too little uric acid. When this happens, uric acid can build up, forming sharp, needlelike urate crystals in a joint or surrounding tissue that cause pain, inflammation and swelling."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you experience sudden, intense pain in a joint, call your doctor. Gout that goes untreated can lead to worsening pain and joint damage. Seek medical care immediately if you have a fever and a joint is hot and inflamed, which can be a sign of infection."

      "Weight.If you're overweight, your body produces more uric acid and your kidneys have a more difficult time eliminating uric acid.",
      "Medical conditions.Certain diseases and conditions increase your risk of gout. These include untreated high blood pressure and chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and heart and kidney diseases.",
      "Certain medications.Low-dose aspirin and some medications used to control hypertension — including thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers — also can increase uric acid levels. So can the use of anti-rejection drugs prescribed for people who have undergone an organ transplant.",
      "Family history of gout.If other members of your family have had gout, you're more likely to develop the disease.",
      "Age and sex.Gout occurs more often in men, primarily because women tend to have lower uric acid levels. After menopause, however, women's uric acid levels approach those of men. Men are also more likely to develop gout earlier — usually between the ages of 30 and 50 — whereas women generally develop signs and symptoms after menopause.",

      "A tiny gland at the base of the brain, called the pituitary gland, makes a hormone that controls the thyroid gland. The antibody linked with Graves' disease is called thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb). TRAb takes over the work of the pituitary hormone. That leads to more thyroid hormone in the body than the body needs. That condition is called hyperthyroidism."

It's more likely to happen when severe hyperthyroidism is not treated or not treated well enough.Thyroid storm happens when a sudden and drastic rise in thyroid hormones causes a number of effects in the body. They include fever, sweating, confusion, delirium, severe weakness, tremors, irregular heartbeat, severe low blood pressure and coma. Thyroid storm needs medical attention right away.",
      "Brittle bones.Hyperthyroidism that isn't treated can lead to weak, brittle bones — a condition called osteoporosis.

    "Risk factors": [
      "Anyone can get heat illness, but certain factors increase your sensitivity to heat. They include:",
      "Young age or old age.Infants and children younger than 4 and adults older than 65 are at higher risk of heat exhaustion. The body's ability to regulate its temperature isn't fully developed in children. In older adults, illness, medicines or other factors can affect the body's ability to control temperature.",
      "Certain drugs.Some medicines can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond properly to heat. These include some medicines used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems (beta blockers, diuretics), reduce allergy symptoms (antihistamines), calm you (tranquilizers), or reduce psychiatric symptoms such as delusions (antipsychotics). Some illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can increase your core temperature.",
      "Obesity.Carrying excess weight can affect your body's ability to regulate its temperature and cause your body to keep more heat.",
      "Sudden temperature changes.If you're not used to the heat, you're more susceptible to heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion. The body needs time to get used to higher temperatures. Traveling to a warm climate from a cold one or living in an area that experiences an early heat wave can put you at risk of a heat-related illness. The body hasn't had a chance to get used to the higher temperatures.",
      "A high heat index.The heat index is a single temperature value that considers how both the outdoor temperature and humidity make you feel. When the humidity is high, your sweat can't evaporate as easily, and your body has more trouble cooling itself. This makes you more prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. When the heat index is 91 F (33 C) or higher, you should take precautions to keep cool."

    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Anyone can develop heatstroke, but several factors increase your risk:",
      "Age.The ability to cope with extreme heat depends on the strength of the central nervous system. In the very young, the central nervous system is not fully developed. In adults over 65, the central nervous system becomes less responsive, which makes the body less able to cope with changes in body temperature. Both age groups usually have difficulty remaining hydrated, which also increases risk.",
      "Exertion in hot weather.Military training and participating in sports, such as football or long-distance running events, in hot weather are among the situations that can lead to heatstroke.",
      "Sudden exposure to hot weather.People may be more susceptible to heat-related illness when they're exposed to a sudden increase in temperature, such as during an early-summer heat wave or travel to a hotter climate.Limit activity for at least several days to allow time to acclimate to the temperature change. However, there may still be an increased risk of heatstroke until a person experiences several weeks of higher temperatures.",
      "A lack of air conditioning.Fans may make you feel better, but during sustained hot weather, air conditioning is the most effective way to cool down and lower humidity.",
      "Certain medicines.Some medicines affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond to heat. Be especially careful in hot weather if you take medicines that narrow your blood vessels (vasoconstrictors), regulate your blood pressure by blocking adrenaline (beta blockers), rid your body of sodium and water (diuretics), or reduce psychiatric symptoms (antidepressants or antipsychotics).Stimulants for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and illegal stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine also make you more vulnerable to heatstroke.",

The virus can spread more easily from men to women than from women to men.",
      "Having sex with multiple partners.The number of people you have sex with is a strong risk factor. Contact with genitals through sex or sexual activity puts you at higher risk. Most people with genital herpes do not know they have it.",
      "Having a partner who has the disease but is not taking medicine to treat it.There is no cure for genital herpes, but medicine can help limit outbreaks.",
      "Certain groups within the population.Women, people with a history of sexually transmitted diseases, older people, Black people in in the United States and men who have sex with men diagnosed with genital herpes at a higher than average rate.

    "Causes": [
      "Causes of hydronephrosis include a blockage or other health issue that affects the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the kidneys and the bladder. Urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. Urine leaves the bladder and the body through another tube called the urethra.",
      "A partly or fully blocked urinary tract can keep urine from leaving the kidneys and cause swelling. Other issues that disrupt the urinary tract can cause urine to flow backward through the ureters from the bladder up into the kidneys. When urine flows the wrong way, the condition is called vesicoureteral reflux.",
      "Causes of hydronephrosis include the following:",
      "Conditions present at birth.Some babies are born with a partial kidney blockage called a ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Most often, the blockage forms where a kidney attaches to one of the tubes that carry urine to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters.Other babies are born with a ureter that isn't typical in structure. Urine flows backward through the ureter from the bladder up into the kidney as a result. When backward urine flow happens, it's known as vesicoureteral reflux.",
      "Kidney stones.These are hard buildups of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys.",
      "Enlarged prostate.A very enlarged prostate can cause the bladder to have trouble emptying urine. Urine may back up into the kidneys as a result.",
      "Injured or narrowed ureter.Pelvic surgery done with cuts through the stomach area could injure a ureter by accident. A ureter could become narrowed for reasons such as scarring after surgery or having radiation therapy for prostate cancer.",
      "Urinary tract infection.This type of infection can inflame any part of the urinary tract, including the kidneys.",
      "Pregnancy.Swelling of the kidneys' urine drainage system is common during pregnancy. Often, hydronephrosis in pregnant people doesn't cause symptoms and goes away after giving birth.",

      "Hydronephrosis risk factors among adults ages 20 to 60 include being born female. The higher risk could be due to certain conditions that affect the uterus, such as pregnancy. It also could be due to conditions that affect the ovaries, such as cysts, buildups of pus and cancer. Risk factors for people older than age 60 include having an enlarged prostate or a urinary tract blockage from cancer."

      "Overactive parathyroid glands. This also is called hyperparathyroidism.It's the most common cause of hypercalcemia. Overactive parathyroid glands make too much parathyroid hormone. The condition can stem from a small tumor that isn't cancer. It also can stem from one or more of the four parathyroid glands becoming larger.",
      "Cancer.Lung cancer, breast cancer and some blood cancers can raise the risk of hypercalcemia. Cancer that spreads to the bones also raises the risk.",
      "Other diseases.Conditions such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis can raise blood levels of vitamin D. That in turn spurs the digestive tract to absorb more calcium.",
      "Genetic factors.A rare genetic condition called familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia causes an increase of calcium in the blood. This condition doesn't cause symptoms or complications of hypercalcemia.",
      "Little or no movement.People who have a condition that causes them to spend a lot of time sitting or lying down can get hypercalcemia. Over time, bones that don't bear weight release calcium into the blood.",
      "Serious dehydration.This is a common cause of mild or short-term hypercalcemia. Having less fluid in the blood causes a rise in calcium.",
      "Some medicines.Medicines such as lithium and thiazide diuretics might cause more parathyroid hormone to be released.",

      "Osteoporosis.This condition involves thinning bones. It could develop if the bones keep releasing calcium into the blood. Osteoporosis can lead to broken bones, curving of the spinal column and loss of height.",
      "Kidney stones.If the urine contains too much calcium, crystals might form in the kidneys. Over time, the crystals can combine to form kidney stones. Passing a stone can be very painful.",
      "Kidney failure.This condition limits the kidneys' ability to clean the blood and get rid of extra fluid. It can develop over time as hypercalcemia damages the kidneys.",

    "disease": "Hyperoxaluria and oxalosis",
    "Symptoms": [
      "Often, the first sign of hyperoxaluria is a kidney stone. Kidney stone symptoms can include:",
      "Sharp pain in the back, side, lower stomach area or groin.",
      "Urine that looks pink, red or brown due to blood.",
      "Frequent urge to pee, also called urination.",
      "Pain when peeing.",
      "Not being able to urinate or peeing only a small amount.",
      "Chills, fever, upset stomach or vomiting."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Hyperoxaluria happens when too much of a chemical called oxalate builds up in the urine. There are different types of hyperoxaluria:",
      "Primary hyperoxaluria.This type is a rare inherited disease, which means that it's passed down in families. It's caused by changes in a gene. With primary hyperoxaluria, the liver doesn't make enough of a certain protein that prevents too much oxalate from being made. Or the protein doesn't work as it should. The body gets rid of excess oxalate through the kidneys, in urine. The extra oxalate can combine with calcium to form kidney stones and crystals. These can damage the kidneys and cause them to stop working.With primary hyperoxaluria, kidney stones form early. They most often cause symptoms from childhood through age 20. The kidneys of many people with primary hyperoxaluria stop working well by early to middle adulthood. But kidney failure can happen even in babies with this disease. Others with primary hyperoxaluria may never have kidney failure.",
      "Enteric hyperoxaluria.Some intestine problems cause the body to absorb more oxalate from foods. This can then increase the amount of oxalate in the urine. Crohn's disease is one intestine problem that can lead to enteric hyperoxaluria. Another is short bowel syndrome, which can happen when parts of the small intestine are removed during surgery.Other health problems make it hard for the small intestine to absorb fats from food. If this happens, it might leave oxalate more available for the gut to absorb. Usually, oxalate combines with calcium in the gut and exits the body through stools. But when there is increased fat in the gut, calcium binds to the fat instead. This allows oxalate to be free in the gut and absorbed in the bloodstream. It's then filtered by the kidneys. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery also can lead to trouble absorbing fat in the gut, which raises the risk of hyperoxaluria.",
      "Hyperoxaluria tied to eating foods with lots of oxalate.Eating large amounts of foods high in oxalate can raise your risk of hyperoxaluria or kidney stones. These foods include nuts, chocolate, brewed tea, spinach, potatoes, beets and rhubarb. It's important to stay away from high-oxalate foods if you have diet-related or enteric hyperoxaluria. Your doctor also may tell you to limit these foods if you have primary hyperoxaluria."

    "When to see a doctor": [
      "It's not common for children to get kidney stones. Kidney stones that form in children and teenagers are likely to be caused by a health problem, such as hyperoxaluria.",
      "All young people with kidney stones should have a checkup. The checkup should include a test that measures oxalate in the urine. Adults who keep getting kidney stones also should be tested for oxalate in the urine."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Without treatment, primary hyperoxaluria can damage the kidneys. Over time the kidneys may stop working. This is called kidney failure. For some people, this is the first sign of the disease.",

      "Pale, ashen skin or other changes to skin color tied to having a low number of red blood cells, also called anemia.",
      "Swelling of hands and feet.",
      "Oxalosis happens if you have primary or enteric hyperoxaluria and your kidneys stop working well enough. The body can no longer get rid of the extra oxalate, so the oxalate starts building up. First it builds up in the blood, then in the eyes, bones, skin, muscles, blood vessels, heart and other organs.",

      "The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.",
      "Symptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.",
      "Other common flu symptoms include:",
      "Fever.",
      "Cough.",
      "Headache.",
      "Muscle aches.",
      "Feeling very tired.",

    "Causes": [
      "Influenza is caused by viruses. These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.",
      "It's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.",
      "Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.",
      "A person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people."

    "Causes": [
      "Hemochromatosis is most often caused by a change in a gene. This gene controls the amount of iron the body absorbs from food. The altered gene is passed from parents to children. This type of hemochromatosis is by far the most common type. It's called hereditary hemochromatosis."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "See a healthcare professional if you experience any of the symptoms of hemochromatosis. If you have an immediate family member who has hemochromatosis, ask your healthcare team about genetic testing. Genetic testing can check if you have the gene that increases your risk of hemochromatosis."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Factors that increase the risk of hemochromatosis include:",
      "Having two copies of an altered HFE gene.This is the greatest risk factor for hereditary hemochromatosis.",
      "Family history.Having a parent or sibling with hemochromatosis increases the likelihood of developing the disease.",
      "Ethnicity.People of Northern European descent are more prone to hereditary hemochromatosis than are people of other ethnic backgrounds. Hemochromatosis is less common in people of Black, Hispanic and Asian ancestry.",
      "Sex.Men are more likely than women to develop symptoms of hemochromatosis at an earlier age. Because women lose iron through menstruation and pregnancy, they tend to store less of the mineral than men do. After menopause or a hysterectomy, the risk increases for women."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Untreated, hemochromatosis can lead to several complications. These complications especially affect the joints and organs where excess iron tends to be stored, such as the liver, pancreas and heart. Complications can include:",
      "Liver issues.Cirrhosis — permanent scarring of the liver — is just one of the complications that may happen. Cirrhosis increases the risk of liver cancer and other life-threatening complications.",
      "Diabetes.Damage to the pancreas can lead to diabetes.",
      "Heart problems.Excess iron in the heart affects the heart's ability to circulate enough blood for the body's needs. This is called congestive heart failure. Hemochromatosis also can cause irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias.",
      "Reproductive problems.Excess iron can lead to erectile dysfunction and loss of sex drive in men. It can cause an absence of the menstrual cycle in women.",
      "Skin color changes.Deposits of iron in skin cells can make the skin appear bronze or gray in color."

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Anything that puts stress on the heart's lower left chamber can cause left ventricular hypertrophy. The lower left chamber is called the left ventricle. As the strain on the lower left chamber increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens. Sometimes, the size of the heart chamber itself also increases.",

      "Things that can cause the heart to work harder and may possibly lead to left ventricular hypertrophy include:",
      "High blood pressure.Also called hypertension, this is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. Long-term high blood pressure strains the left side of the heart, causing it to grow bigger. Treating high blood pressure can help reduce left ventricular hypertrophy symptoms and may even reverse it.",
      "Narrowing of the aortic valve.The aortic valve is between the lower left heart chamber and the body's main artery, called the aorta. Narrowing of the valve is called aortic stenosis. When the valve is narrowed, the heart must work harder to pump blood into the aorta.",
      "Intensive athletic training.Intense, long-term strength and endurance training causes changes in the heart. The changes help the heart handle the extra physical workload. But the changes can make the heart muscle grow larger. Sometimes this is called athlete's heart or athletic heart syndrome. It's unclear whether the increased heart size in athletes can lead to stiffening of the heart muscle and disease.",
      "Certain conditions passed down through families, called genetic conditions, can make the heart thicker. They include:",
      "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.This condition is caused by changes in genes that cause the heart muscle to thicken. The thickening makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. It can occur even without high blood pressure. People with one parent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have a 50% chance of having the changed gene that causes the disease.",
      "Amyloidosis.Proteins build up around the organs, including the heart. The collection of proteins interferes with how the organs work. When the condition is passed down through families, it is called familial amyloidosis. It also may affect the nerves and kidneys."

      "Some people with long QT syndrome (LQTS) do not notice any symptoms. The disorder may be found during a heart test called an electrocardiogram. Or it may be discovered when genetic tests are done for other reasons."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by changes in the heart's electrical signaling system. It doesn't affect the shape or form of the heart.",
      "To understand the causes ofLQTS, it may help to know how the heart usually beats.",
      "In a typical heart, the heart sends blood out to the body during each heartbeat. The heart's chambers squeeze and relax to pump the blood. The heart's electrical system controls this coordinated action. Electrical signals called impulses move from the top to the bottom of the heart. They tell the heart when to squeeze and beat. After each heartbeat, the system recharges to prepare for the next heartbeat.",
      "But in long QT syndrome, the heart's electrical system takes longer than usual to recover between beats. This delay is called a prolonged QT interval.",
      "Long QT syndrome usually falls into two groups.",
      "Congenital long QT syndrome.You're born with this type ofLQTS. It's caused by changes in DNA that are passed down through families. That means it is inherited.",

      "Using medicines known to cause prolonged QT intervals.",
      "People who are assigned female at birth who take certain heart medicines.",
      "A lot of vomiting or diarrhea, which can cause changes in body minerals such as potassium.",
      "Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, which also cause changes in the levels of body minerals.",
      "If you have long QT syndrome and want to become pregnant, tell your healthcare professional. Your care team carefully checks you during pregnancy to help prevent things that can triggerLQTSsymptoms."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Usually after an episode of long QT syndrome (LQTS), the heart goes back to a regular rhythm. But sudden cardiac death can happen if the heart rhythm isn't quickly corrected. The heart rhythm may reset on its own. Sometimes, treatment is needed to reset the heart rhythm.",
      "Complications of long QT syndrome may include:",
      "Torsades de pointes (\"twisting of the points\").This is a life-threatening fast heartbeat. The heart's two lower chambers beat fast and out of rhythm. The heart pumps out less blood. The lack of blood to the brain causes sudden fainting, often without warning.If a long QT interval lasts for a long time, fainting can be followed by a full-body seizure. If the dangerous rhythm does not correct itself, then a life-threatening arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation follows.",
      "Ventricular fibrillation.This type of irregular heartbeat causes the lower heart chambers to beat so fast that the heart trembles and stops pumping blood. Unless a device called a defibrillator is quickly used to correct the heart's rhythm, brain damage and death can happen.",
      "Sudden cardiac death.This is the swift and not expected ending of all heart activity. Long QT syndrome has been linked to sudden cardiac death in young people who otherwise appear healthy.LQTSmight be responsible for some unexplained events in children and young adults, such as unexplained fainting, drownings or seizures.",

      "If you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. But an emotional crash always follows this euphoria. This crash can leave you depressed and worn out. It could cause you to have problems getting along with others. It also could leave you in financial or legal trouble.",

Surgery to remove the ovaries causes instant menopause.Your periods stop. You're likely to have hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. Symptoms can be severe because the surgery causes hormones to drop all at once rather than slowly over several years.Surgery that removes the uterus but not the ovaries, called hysterectomy, most often doesn't cause instant menopause. You no longer have periods. But your ovaries still release eggs and make estrogen and progesterone for a time.",

Periods sometimes return after chemotherapy. Then you can still get pregnant. So you might want to keep using birth control.Radiation therapy aimed at the pelvis, belly and lower spine can cause menopause. Radiation to the whole body for stem cell transplant also can cause menopause.

The lining of the uterus also is known as the endometrium. This lining is shed during a menstrual period. When hormones are out of balance, the lining becomes too thick and sheds by way of heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.A number of conditions can cause hormone imbalances. These include obesity, insulin resistance, thyroid problems and polycystic ovary syndrome, which also is called PCOS.",
      "Problems with the ovaries.Sometimes ovaries don't release an egg during a menstrual cycle. This also is known as anovulation. When this happens, the body doesn't make the hormone progesterone the way it usually does during a menstrual cycle. This leads to hormone imbalance and may result in heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.",
      "Uterine fibroids.These tumors develop during childbearing years. They are benign, which means they are not cancerous. Uterine fibroids may cause heavier than normal menstrual bleeding or bleeding that goes on for a long time.",
      "Polyps.These small growths on the lining of the uterus may cause menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts for a long time. They may cause bleeding between periods. Polyps also can cause spotting or bleeding after menopause. The growths are not cancerous.",

The lining of the uterus also is known as the endometrium. This lining is shed during a menstrual period. When hormones are out of balance, the lining becomes too thick and sheds by way of heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.A number of conditions can cause hormone imbalances. These include obesity, insulin resistance, thyroid problems and polycystic ovary syndrome, which also is called PCOS.",

When this happens, the body doesn't make the hormone progesterone the way it usually does during a menstrual cycle. This leads to hormone imbalance and may result in heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods.",

    "Risk factors": [
      "Factors that may raise the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma include:",
      "Skin that sunburns easily.Anyone of any skin color can get Merkel cell carcinoma. But it's more common in people who have less melanin in their skin. Melanin is a substance that gives color to skin. It also helps protect the skin from damaging rays from the sun.People with Black or brown skin have more melanin than do people with white skin. So white people are more likely to get Merkel cell carcinoma than are people with Black or brown skin.",
      "Too much UV light.Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, raises the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma. UV light can come from the sun. Being in the sun without covering the skin with clothing or sunblock raises the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma. UV light for treatment of the skin condition psoriasis also can raise the risk of this skin cancer.",
      "Tanning bed use.People who use indoor tanning beds have a higher risk of Merkel cell carcinoma.",
      "A weakened immune system.People with weakened immune systems are more likely to get Merkel cell carcinoma. A weakened immune system can happen in people with certain health conditions, such as HIV infection and chronic leukemia. It also can happen in people taking certain medicines, such as medicines that lower the immune response.",
      "History of other skin cancers.Merkel cell carcinoma is linked to other skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.",
      "Older age.The risk of Merkel cell carcinoma goes up with age. This cancer is most common in people older than age 50, though it can happen at any age."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Even with treatment, Merkel cell carcinoma often spreads to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, healthcare professionals sometimes say it metastasizes. Merkel cell carcinoma tends to travel first to nearby lymph nodes.",
      "Later it may spread to the brain, bones, liver or lungs. It can keep these organs from working as they should. Cancer that spreads is harder to treat and can be fatal."

      "Weight loss.People with pancreatic cancer might lose weight as the cancer uses more of the body's energy. Nausea and vomiting caused by cancer treatments or a cancer pressing on the stomach might make it hard to eat. Sometimes the body has trouble getting nutrients from food because the pancreas isn't making enough digestive juices.",

Jaundice can cause dark-colored urine and pale-colored stools. Jaundice often occurs without belly pain.If the bile duct is blocked, a plastic or metal tube called a stent can be put inside it. The stent helps hold the bile duct open. This is done using a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, also called ERCP.DuringERCP, a health care professional puts a long tube with a tiny camera, called an endoscope, down the throat. The tube goes through the stomach and into the upper part of the small intestine. The health professional puts a dye into the pancreatic ducts and bile ducts through a small tube that fits through the endoscope. The dye helps the ducts show up on imaging tests. The health professional uses those images to place a stent at the right spot in the duct to help hold it open.",
      "Pain.A growing tumor may press on nerves in your abdomen, causing pain that can become severe. Pain medications can help you feel more comfortable. Treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, might help slow tumor growth and provide some pain relief.When medicines aren't helping, a health care professional might suggest a celiac plexus block. This procedure uses a needle to put alcohol into the nerves that control pain in the belly. The alcohol stops the nerves from sending pain signals to the brain.",
      "Bowel blockage.Pancreatic cancer can grow into or press on the first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. This can block the flow of digested food from the stomach into the intestines.A health care professional might suggest putting a tube called a stent in the small intestine to hold it open. Sometimes, it might help to have surgery to place a feeding tube. Or surgery can attach the stomach to a lower part of the intestines where the cancer isn't causing a blockage."

      "Vaginal and bladder problems.When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence.",
      "Decreasing fertility.As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months.",
      "Changes in sexual function.During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond.",
      "Loss of bone.With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones.",
      "Changing cholesterol levels.Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the \"good\" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "As you go through perimenopause, your body's production of estrogen and progesterone, key female hormones, rises and falls. Many of the changes you experience during perimenopause are a result of decreasing estrogen."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Some women seek medical attention for their perimenopausal symptoms. But others either tolerate the changes or simply don't experience symptoms severe enough to need attention. Because symptoms may be subtle and come on gradually, you may not realize at first that they're all connected to the same thing — hormone fluctuations of the menopausal transition.",

      "Family history.Women with a family history of early menopause may experience early menopause themselves.",
      "Cancer treatment.Treatment for cancer with chemotherapy or pelvic radiation therapy has been linked to early menopause.",
      "Hysterectomy.A hysterectomy that removes your uterus, but not your ovaries, usually doesn't cause menopause. Although you no longer have periods, your ovaries still produce estrogen. But such surgery may cause menopause to occur earlier than average. Also, if you have one ovary removed, the remaining ovary might stop working sooner than expected."

      "A bend to the penis.The penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side.",

      "During the healing process after injury to the penis, scar tissue forms. This can lead to a lump you can feel or to a curve in the penis.",

Each of the corpora cavernosa is encased in a sheath of elastic tissue called the tunica albuginea (TOO-nih-kuh al-BYOO-JIN-e-uh). The sheath stretches during an erection.",
      "When you become sexually aroused, more blood flows to these chambers. As the chambers fill with blood, the penis expands, straightens and stiffens into an erection.",
      "In Peyronie disease, when the penis becomes erect, the area with the scar tissue doesn't stretch. As a result, the penis bends or goes through other changes. This can be painful.",

      "Scar tissue.The scar tissue linked with Peyronie disease also is called plaque. It's different from plaque that can build up in blood vessels or on your teeth. It can be felt under the skin of the penis as flat lumps or a band of hard tissue. The area over the scar tissue may feel tender.",
      "A bend to the penis.The penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side.",
      "Erection problems.Peyronie disease might cause problems getting or keeping an erection. This also is called erectile dysfunction. Often though, people with Peyronie disease say they notice erectile dysfunction before the start of their other penile symptoms.",
      "Shortening of the penis.The penis might become shorter during erections due to Peyronie disease.",
      "Pain in the penis.This symptom might happen with or without an erection.",
      "Other changes in how the penis looks.In some people with Peyronie disease, the erect penis might look narrow or indented. It might even take on an hourglass-like shape, with a tight, narrow band around the shaft.",
      "The curving and penile shortening linked with Peyronie disease might become worse over time. Physical changes in the penis often get worse or stay the same during the first year to year and a half.",

      "During the healing process after injury to the penis, scar tissue forms. This can lead to a lump you can feel or to a curve in the penis.",
      "Each side of the penis contains a spongelike tube called a corpus cavernosum. These tubes have many tiny blood vessels. Each of the corpora cavernosa is encased in a sheath of elastic tissue called the tunica albuginea (TOO-nih-kuh al-BYOO-JIN-e-uh). The sheath stretches during an erection.",
      "When you become sexually aroused, more blood flows to these chambers. As the chambers fill with blood, the penis expands, straightens and stiffens into an erection.",
      "In Peyronie disease, when the penis becomes erect, the area with the scar tissue doesn't stretch. As a result, the penis bends or goes through other changes. This can be painful.",
      "In most people, Peyronie disease symptoms come on slowly and don't seem to be linked with an injury. Researchers are looking into whether Peyronie disease might be tied to a genetic trait or certain health conditions."

      "Researchers don't know exactly what causes a pheochromocytoma. The tumor forms in cells called chromaffin cells. These cells are located in the center of an adrenal gland. They release certain hormones, mainly adrenaline and noradrenaline. These hormones help control many body functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar.",
      "Adrenaline and noradrenaline trigger the body's fight-or-flight response. That response happens when the body thinks there is a threat. The hormones cause blood pressure to rise and the heart to beat faster. They also prepare other body systems so you can react quickly. A pheochromocytoma causes more of these hormones to be released. And it causes them to be released when you're not in a threatening situation.",
      "Most of the chromaffin cells are in the adrenal glands. But small clusters of these cells also are in the heart, head, neck, bladder, stomach area and along the spine. Chromaffin cell tumors located outside of the adrenal glands are called paragangliomas. They may cause the same effects on the body as a pheochromocytoma."

This type of tumor is called benign or nonmetastatic pheochromocytoma. Rarely, the tumors are cancer and are spreading in the body. This type of tumor is called malignant or metastatic pheochromocytoma. Often, benign tumors related to these rare genetic conditions form in both adrenal glands. Genetic conditions linked with pheochromocytoma include:",

Most cases of colorectal cancer arise from an adenoma that has been present for a long time. However, serrated lesions also can become cancerous.

    "Causes": [
      "Experts think Dressler syndrome is caused by the immune system's response to heart damage. The body reacts to the injured tissue by sending immune cells and proteins called antibodies to clean up and repair the affected area. Sometimes this response causes swelling due to the inflammation in the sac around the heart that's known as the pericardium.",

The adrenal glands make hormones that affect almost every organ and tissue in the body.",

Typically, the adrenal glands make two or three times the usual amount of cortisol in response to physical stress. But with adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol to meet this need. And that can lead to adrenal crisis.",
      "Adrenal crisis results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. This complication needs treatment right away."

    "Causes": [
      "The exact cause of most rectal cancers isn't known.",
      "Rectal cancer happens when cells in the rectum develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.",
      "The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer."

      "Black race.Black people in the United States have a greater risk of colorectal cancer than do people of other races.",
      "Diabetes.People with type 2 diabetes may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.",
      "Drinking alcohol.Heavy drinking increases the risk of colorectal cancer.",
      "A diet low in vegetables.Colorectal cancer may be related to a diet low in vegetables and high in red meat.",
      "Family history of colorectal cancer.You're more likely to develop colorectal cancer if you have a parent, sibling or child with colon or rectal cancer.",
      "Inflammatory bowel disease.Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon and rectum, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, increase your risk of colorectal cancer.",
      "Inherited syndromes that increase colorectal cancer risk.In some families, DNA changes passed from parents to children may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. These changes are involved in only a small percentage of rectal cancers. Inherited syndromes may include familial adenomatous polyposis, also known as FAP, and Lynch syndrome. Genetic testing can detect these and other, rarer inherited colorectal cancer syndromes.",
      "Obesity.People who are obese have an increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with people considered to be at a healthy weight.",
      "Older age.Colorectal cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but most people with this type of cancer are older than 50. The rates of colorectal cancer in people younger than 50 have been increasing, but healthcare professionals aren't sure why.",
      "Radiation therapy for previous cancer.Radiation therapy directed at the abdomen to treat previous cancers may increase the risk of colorectal cancer.",
      "Smoking.People who smoke may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.",
      "Too little exercise.If you're inactive, you're more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of cancer."

Fistulas caused by injuries during childbirth may involve injury to the anal sphincter — the rings of muscle at the end of the rectum that help hold in stool.",
      "Inflammatory bowel disease.The second most common cause of rectovaginal fistulas is Crohn's disease and, more rarely, ulcerative colitis. These inflammatory bowel diseases cause swelling and irritation of the tissues lining the digestive tract. Most people with Crohn's disease never develop a rectovaginal fistula, but having Crohn's disease does increase your risk of the condition.",
      "Cancer or radiation treatment in the pelvic area.A cancerous tumor in your rectum, cervix, vagina, uterus or anal canal can result in a rectovaginal fistula. Also, radiation therapy for cancers in these areas can put you at risk. A fistula caused by radiation can form at any time following radiation treatment, but most commonly forms within the first two years.",
      "Surgery involving the vagina, perineum, rectum or anus.In rare cases, prior surgery in your lower pelvic area, such as removing an infected Bartholin's gland, can cause a fistula to develop. Bartholin's glands are found on each side of the vaginal opening and help keep the vagina moist. The fistula may develop as a result of an injury during surgery or a leak or infection that develops afterward.",
      "Complication from diverticulitis.Infection of small, bulging pouches in your digestive tract, called diverticulitis, may cause the rectum or large intestine to stick to the vagina and may lead to a fistula.",

If rheumatic fever causes mitral valve disease, the condition is called rheumatic mitral valve disease. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States.",
      "Heart attack.A heart attack can damage the area of the heart muscle that supports the mitral valve. If there is a lot of heart attack damage, sudden and severe mitral valve regurgitation can occur. A leaky mitral valve caused by a heart attack is called ischemic mitral regurgitation.",
      "Heart problem present at birth, also called a congenital heart defect.Some people are born with heart structure problems, including damaged heart valves.",
      "Thickening of the heart muscle, called cardiomyopathy.Cardiomyopathy makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. The condition can affect how the mitral valve works, causing regurgitation. Types of cardiomyopathy linked to mitral valve regurgitation include dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",
      "Damaged tissue cords.Over time, the pieces of tissue that hold the flaps of the mitral valve to the heart wall may stretch or tear. This is especially likely in people with mitral valve prolapse. A tear can cause blood to suddenly leak through the mitral valve. It may require mitral valve repair surgery.

    ],
    "Causes": [
      "To understand the causes of mitral valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart works.",
      "The mitral valve is one of four valves in the heart that keep blood flowing in the right direction. Each valve has flaps, also called leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat.",
      "In mitral valve regurgitation, the valve flaps don't close tightly. Blood moves backward when the valve is closed. This makes it harder for the heart to work properly.",
      "If mitral valve regurgitation is due to problems with the mitral valve, the condition is called primary mitral valve regurgitation.",
      "If a problem or disease affecting other areas of the heart cause a leaky mitral valve, the condition is called functional or secondary mitral regurgitation.",
      "Possible causes of mitral valve regurgitation include:",
      "Mitral valve prolapse.In this condition, the mitral valve's flaps bulge back into the left upper heart chamber when the heart squeezes. This common heart problem can prevent the mitral valve from closing tightly and cause blood to flow backward.",
      "Rheumatic fever.Rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated strep throat. Rheumatic fever can damage the mitral valve, leading to mitral valve regurgitation early or later in life. If rheumatic fever causes mitral valve disease, the condition is called rheumatic mitral valve disease. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States.",
      "Heart attack.A heart attack can damage the area of the heart muscle that supports the mitral valve. If there is a lot of heart attack damage, sudden and severe mitral valve regurgitation can occur. A leaky mitral valve caused by a heart attack is called ischemic mitral regurgitation.",
      "Heart problem present at birth, also called a congenital heart defect.Some people are born with heart structure problems, including damaged heart valves.",
      "Thickening of the heart muscle, called cardiomyopathy.Cardiomyopathy makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. The condition can affect how the mitral valve works, causing regurgitation. Types of cardiomyopathy linked to mitral valve regurgitation include dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",
      "Damaged tissue cords.Over time, the pieces of tissue that hold the flaps of the mitral valve to the heart wall may stretch or tear. This is especially likely in people with mitral valve prolapse. A tear can cause blood to suddenly leak through the mitral valve. It may require mitral valve repair surgery. A chest injury also can cause rupture of the cords.",
      "Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves, called endocarditis.This condition is usually caused by an infection. Germs get into the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart.",
      "Radiation therapy.Rarely, radiation therapy for cancer that is focused on the chest area can lead to mitral valve regurgitation."

    "Causes": [
      "Retinoblastoma is caused by changes inside the cells in the eye. It's not always clear what causes the changes that lead to this eye cancer.",
      "Retinoblastoma starts when cells in the eye get changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions also tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.",
      "In retinoblastoma, this growth of cells happens in the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive lining on the inside of the eye. The retina is made up of nerve tissue that senses light as it comes in through the front of the eye. The light causes the retina to send signals to the brain. The brain interprets the signals as images.",
      "As the cancer cells build up in the retina, they can form a mass, called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. Retinoblastoma rarely spreads, especially if it's found early.",

      "Race.People with white skin, particularly those of Northern European descent, have the highest risk of developing MS. People of Asian, African or Native American descent have the lowest risk. A recent study suggests that the number of Black and Hispanic young adults with multiple sclerosis may be greater than previously thought.",
      "Climate.MS is far more common in places with temperate climates. These include Canada, the northern United States, New Zealand, southeastern Australia and Europe.",
      "Vitamin D.Having low levels of vitamin D and low exposure to sunlight is linked to a greater risk of MS. Your birth month also may affect the chances of developing MS. This has to do with levels of sun exposure when a mother is pregnant.",
      "Obesity.People who are obese or were obese in childhood have an increased risk of multiple sclerosis.",
      "Certain autoimmune diseases.You have a slightly higher risk of developing MS if you have other autoimmune conditions. These may include thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease.",

      "Epididymitis.This is when the coiled tube at the back of the testicle, called the epididymis, becomes inflamed.Often, epididymitis is caused by an infection with bacteria. For instance, bacterial infections that spread through sex, such as chlamydia, can cause it. Less often, a virus can lead to epididymitis.",
      "Orchitis.This is when inflammation, which can include pain and swelling, affects the testicle. Usually, it's due to an illness caused by a virus, most often mumps.",
      "Hydrocele.This is when extra fluid collects between the layers of a sac that surrounds each testicle. Most often, there's a small amount of fluid in this space. But the excess fluid of a hydrocele can lead to a painless swelling of the scrotum.In adults, a hydrocele can happen because of an imbalance in the amounts of fluid made or absorbed. Often, this is due to an injury or infection in the scrotum.In babies, a hydrocele tends to happen because an opening between the stomach area and the scrotum hasn't properly closed during development.",
      "Hematocele.This is a buildup of blood between the layers of a sac that surrounds each testicle. An injury, such as a direct hit to the testicles, is the most likely cause.",
      "Varicocele.This happens when the veins inside the scrotum get bigger. Varicocele is more common on the left side of the scrotum due to differences in how blood flows from each side. A varicocele might cause infertility, which is when you can't get your partner pregnant after a year of unprotected sex.",
      "Inguinal hernia.This is when part of the small intestine pushes through an opening or weak spot in the tissue that separates the stomach area and groin. It might appear as a mass in the scrotum or higher in the groin.In infants, an inguinal hernia often happens before birth when the passageway from the stomach area to the scrotum doesn't close.",
      "Testicular torsion.This is a painful problem that cuts off blood to the testicle. It happens due to a twisting of the spermatic cord. That's a bundle of blood vessels, nerves and the tube that carries semen from the testicle to the penis. Without prompt treatment, testicular torsion can lead to the loss of the testicle."

It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again.",

It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall.

      "Travel or work schedule.Your body's \"internal clock,\" known as circadian rhythms, guides things such as your sleep-wake cycle, metabolism and body temperature. Disrupting these rhythms can lead to insomnia. Causes include feeling jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late or early shift, or changing shifts often.",
      "Poor sleep habits.Poor sleep habits include going to bed and waking up at different times each day, taking naps, being too active before bedtime and having a sleep area that is not comfortable. Other poor sleep habits include working, eating or watching TV while in bed. Using computers or smartphones, playing video games, or watching TV just before bed can disrupt your sleep cycle.",
      "Eating too much late in the evening.Having a light snack before bedtime is OK. But eating too much may cause you to feel uncomfortable while lying down. Many people also have heartburn. This is when stomach acid backs up into the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. This tube is called the esophagus. Heartburn may keep you awake.",

      "Sleep-related disorders.Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing at times during the night, disrupting your sleep. Restless legs syndrome causes a strong uncomfortable urge to move your legs when trying to fall asleep. This may keep you from falling asleep or getting back to sleep.",
      "Caffeine, nicotine and alcohol.Coffee, tea, cola and other drinks that have caffeine are stimulants. Drinking them in the late afternoon or evening can keep you from falling asleep at night. Nicotine in tobacco products is another stimulant that can disrupt sleep. Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often results in waking up in the middle of the night."

    "When to see a doctor": [

      "You have a mental health or physical health condition.Many issues that affect your mental or physical health can disrupt sleep.",

      "Making more errors or having more accidents.",
      "Having ongoing worries about sleep."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Insomnia may be the main problem or it may be related to other conditions.",
      "Long-term insomnia is usually due to stress, life events or habits that disrupt sleep. While treating the cause of your sleep problem may stop your insomnia, sometimes it can last for years.",
      "Common causes of long-term insomnia include:",
      "Stress.Concerns about work, school, health, money or family can keep your mind active at night, making it hard to sleep. Stressful life events, such as the death or illness of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss, also may lead to insomnia.",
      "Travel or work schedule.Your body's \"internal clock,\" known as circadian rhythms, guides things such as your sleep-wake cycle, metabolism and body temperature. Disrupting these rhythms can lead to insomnia. Causes include feeling jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late or early shift, or changing shifts often.",
      "Poor sleep habits.Poor sleep habits include going to bed and waking up at different times each day, taking naps, being too active before bedtime and having a sleep area that is not comfortable. Other poor sleep habits include working, eating or watching TV while in bed. Using computers or smartphones, playing video games, or watching TV just before bed can disrupt your sleep cycle.",
      "Eating too much late in the evening.Having a light snack before bedtime is OK. But eating too much may cause you to feel uncomfortable while lying down. Many people also have heartburn. This is when stomach acid backs up into the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. This tube is called the esophagus. Heartburn may keep you awake.",
      "Mental health disorders.Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, may disrupt your sleep. Waking up too early can be a sign of depression. Insomnia often occurs with other mental health conditions.",
      "Medicines.Many prescription drugs can interfere with sleep, such as certain antidepressants and medicines for asthma or blood pressure. Many medicines available without a prescription, such as some pain medicines, allergy and cold medicines, and weight-loss products, contain caffeine and other stimulants that can disrupt sleep.",
      "Medical conditions.Examples of conditions linked with insomnia include ongoing pain, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), overactive thyroid, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.",
      "Sleep-related disorders.Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing at times during the night, disrupting your sleep. Restless legs syndrome causes a strong uncomfortable urge to move your legs when trying to fall asleep. This may keep you from falling asleep or getting back to sleep.",
      "Caffeine, nicotine and alcohol.Coffee, tea, cola and other drinks that have caffeine are stimulants. Drinking them in the late afternoon or evening can keep you from falling asleep at night. Nicotine in tobacco products is another stimulant that can disrupt sleep. Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often results in waking up in the middle of the night."

    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If insomnia makes it hard for you to do daily activities, see your doctor or another primary care professional. Your doctor will search for the cause of your sleep problem and help treat it. If it's thought that you could have a sleep disorder, your doctor might suggest going to a sleep center for special testing."

      "You're over 60.Because of changes in sleep patterns and health, it's more likely you'll have insomnia as you get older.",
      "You have a mental health or physical health condition.Many issues that affect your mental or physical health can disrupt sleep.",
      "You're under a lot of stress.Being stressed can cause short-term insomnia. Major or long-lasting stress can lead to long-term insomnia.",

But you can sometimes see symptoms on the newborn's skin above the small gap in the spine. You might see a tuft of hair, a small dimple or a birthmark. Sometimes, these skin marks can be symptoms of a spinal cord issue that can be found withMRIor a spinal ultrasound in a newborn.",
      "Meningocele.This type may affect bladder and bowel function.",
      "Myelomeningocele.In this most serious type of spina bifida, the spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and part of the spinal cord or nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac. Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac. Babies with this type of spina bifida may have trouble with bladder and bowel function. They also may experience weakness or lack of movement in the legs. Babies may have a buildup of fluid in the brain called hydrocephalus that can put pressure on brain tissue."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "The cause of spina bifida is not known. It's thought that a combination of genetic, nutritional and environmental risk factors causes the condition. This includes having a family history of neural tube defects and getting too little folate, also known as vitamin B-9, during pregnancy."

    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Typically, myelomeningocele is diagnosed before or right after birth, when medical care is available.

Families can be educated on the different complications to watch for.",
      "Children with spina bifida occulta typically don't have symptoms or complications. In these children, usually only routine pediatric care is needed."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Spina bifida is more common among Hispanic people and white people. Also, female babies are affected more often than male babies. Although healthcare professionals and researchers don't know why spina bifida occurs, they have identified some risk factors:",
      "Too little folate in the pregnant person's body.Folate, the natural form of vitamin B-9, is important to the development of a healthy baby. Folic acid is the synthetic form that's found in supplements and fortified foods. If folate levels are too low, it's known as a deficiency. Folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other conditions that affect the neural tube.",
      "Family history of neural tube defects.Having one child with a condition that affects the neural tube slightly increases the chance of having another baby with the same condition. The risk increases even more if two previous children have been affected by the condition.Also, being born with a neural tube defect increases the chance of giving birth to a child with spina bifida. However, most babies with spina bifida are born to parents with no known family history of the condition.",
      "Some medicines.Taking anti-seizure medicines such as valproic acid during pregnancy increases the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. This might happen because the medicines interfere with the body's ability to use folate and folic acid.",
      "Diabetes.Having diabetes that is not well controlled before becoming pregnant increases the risk of having a baby with spina bifida.",
      "Obesity.Obesity at the time of pregnancy also is associated with an increased risk of spina bifida.",
      "Increased body temperature.Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature in the early weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida. A high core body temperature can be caused by a fever or by using a sauna or hot tub.",
      "If you have known risk factors for spina bifida, talk with your healthcare professional. You may need a larger dose or prescription dose of folic acid, even before a pregnancy begins.",
      "Also tell your healthcare professional about all of the medicines you take. If you plan ahead, some medicines can be adjusted to lower the potential risk of spina bifida."

      "Walking and mobility problems.The nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spinal cord that is affected. This can cause muscle weakness of the legs. Sometimes it can cause loss of movement, known as paralysis. Whether a child can walk depends on the location of the spine that's affected and the size of the opening in the neural tube. Ability to walk also depends on the care received before and after birth.",
      "Orthopedic complications.Children with myelomeningocele can have several complications in the legs and spine because of weak muscles. The complications depend on the location of the spine that's affected. Possible orthopedic issues may include:Curved spine, known as scoliosis.Changes that aren't typical, such as an inward-facing foot, known as clubfoot.Dislocation of the hip.Bone and joint conditions.Shortened, tight muscles, known as muscle contractures.",

The brainstem is the lowest part of the brain above the spinal cord. In Chiari malformation type 2, the brainstem becomes longer and is lower than usual in the spinal canal or area of the neck. This can cause arm weakness and trouble with breathing and swallowing. Rarely, this condition can cause compression on this area of the brain. Surgery is needed to relieve the pressure.",
      "Infection in the tissues surrounding the brain, known as meningitis.Some babies with myelomeningocele may develop an infection in the tissues surrounding the brain. This potentially dangerous infection may cause brain injury.",
      "Tethered spinal cord.A tethered spinal cord is when the spinal nerves attach to tissue and stretch. This can happen with scar tissue that resulted from surgery. When a spinal cord is tethered, it's less able to grow as the child grows. It can lead to loss of muscle function in the legs, bowel or bladder. Surgery can limit the degree of disability.",
      "Sleep-disordered breathing.Sleep apnea or other sleep conditions can affect both children and adults with spina bifida, particularly those with myelomeningocele. They may need to be tested to see if they briefly stop breathing several times during sleep, known as sleep apnea. Getting treatment can improve health and quality of life.",
      "Skin problems.Children with spina bifida have less feeling in some parts of their bodies and may get wounds on their feet, legs, buttocks or backs. Blisters or sores can turn into deep wounds or foot infections that are hard to treat. Children with myelomeningocele have a higher risk of developing wounds in casts.",
      "Latex allergy.Children with spina bifida have a higher risk of an allergic reaction to natural rubber or latex products. A latex allergy may cause rash, sneezing, itching, watery eyes and a runny nose. It also can cause a dangerous condition in which the face and airways swell and make it hard to breathe, known as anaphylaxis. It's best to use latex-free gloves and equipment during childbirth and when caring for a child with spina bifida.",

Therefore, your skin can't send a message to your brain when it's injured by certain things such as prolonged pressure.This can increase the risk of getting pressure sores. Changing positions often — with help, if needed — can help prevent the sores. Proper skin care also can help prevent pressure sores.",
      "Circulatory control.People with a spinal cord injury may have low blood pressure when they rise, known as orthostatic hypotension. They also may have swelling in the arms and legs.

    "Symptoms": [
      "The ability to control your arms or legs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors. One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord. The other factor is how bad the injury is.",
      "The lowest part of the spinal cord not damaged after an injury is known as the neurological level of the injury. \"The completeness\" of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost. Completeness is classified as:",
      "Complete.If all feeling and all ability to control movement are lost below the spinal cord injury, the injury is called complete.",
      "Incomplete.If some feeling and control of movement remain below the affected area, the injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury.",
      "Loss of feeling and control of movement is known as paralysis. Paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as:",
      "Tetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia.This means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury.",
      "Paraplegia.This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs but not the arms.",
      "Your healthcare team performs a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury.",
      "Spinal cord injuries can cause the following symptoms:",
      "Loss of movement.",
      "Loss of or a change in sensation. This includes a change in the ability to feel heat, cold and touch.",
      "Loss of bowel or bladder control.",

      "Pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in the spinal cord.",
      "Trouble breathing, coughing or clearing secretions from the lungs."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Spinal cord injuries can result from damage to the spinal cord itself or to the bones that surround the spinal cord, known as the vertebrae. Injuries also may happen as a result of damage to the ligaments or disks of the spinal column.",
      "A sudden, traumatic blow to the spine can fracture, dislocate, crush or compress one or more of the vertebrae. A gunshot or knife wound that penetrates and cuts the spinal cord also can cause a spinal cord injury.",
      "Additional damage usually occurs over days or weeks. This is because of bleeding, swelling and fluid accumulation in and around the spinal cord after an injury.",
      "Other causes of a spinal cord injury don't include trauma. Arthritis, cancer, inflammation, infections or disk degeneration of the spine can be possible causes."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Anyone who has an injury to the head or neck needs an immediate medical evaluation. It is safest to assume that the person has a spinal injury until proved otherwise. This is important because:",
      "A serious spinal injury is not always immediately obvious. If a spinal injury occurs but it is not known, worse injury may occur.",
      "Numbness or paralysis can happen quickly or come on gradually.",
      "The time between injury and treatment can be critical. Learning the level of the injury can help determine the possible recovery."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "A spinal cord injury usually results from an accident and can happen to anyone. But certain factors can increase the risk of having a spinal cord injury, including:",
      "Being male.Spinal cord injuries largely affect men. In fact, women account for only about 20% of traumatic spinal cord injuries in the United States.",
      "Being between the ages of 16 and 30.More than half of spinal cord injuries occur in people in this age range.",
      "Being 65 and older.Another spike in spinal cord injuries occurs at age 65. Falls cause most injuries in older adults.",
      "Alcohol use.Alcohol use is involved in about 25% of traumatic spinal cord injuries.",
      "Engaging in risky behavior.Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries for people under 65. Other risky behaviors include diving into shallow water and playing sports without wearing safety gear or taking proper precautions.",
      "Having certain diseases.A minor injury can cause spinal cord damage if you have a condition that affects your joints or bones, such as osteoporosis."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "A spinal cord injury can lead to many complications. Your rehabilitation team helps you develop tools to address these complications. The team also recommends equipment and resources to promote your quality of life and independence. Areas often affected include:",
      "Bladder control.The bladder continues to store urine from the kidneys after a spinal cord injury. But the injury may interfere with the brain receiving the messages it needs to control the bladder.Changes in bladder control increase the risk of urinary tract infections. The changes also may cause kidney infections and kidney or bladder stones. During rehabilitation, you learn ways to help empty your bladder.",
      "Bowel control.The stomach and intestines work much like they did before the injury, but control of bowel movements is often altered. A high-fiber diet might help regulate the bowels. You also can learn ways to help control your bowel.",
      "Pressure injuries.Below the neurological level of your injury, you might have lost some or all skin sensations. Therefore, your skin can't send a message to your brain when it's injured by certain things such as prolonged pressure.This can increase the risk of getting pressure sores. Changing positions often — with help, if needed — can help prevent the sores. Proper skin care also can help prevent pressure sores.",
      "Circulatory control.People with a spinal cord injury may have low blood pressure when they rise, known as orthostatic hypotension. They also may have swelling in the arms and legs. This can increase the risk of developing blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolus.Another issue with circulatory control is a potentially life-threatening rise in blood pressure, known as autonomic dysreflexia. Your rehabilitation team can teach you how to address these issues if they affect you.",
      "Respiratory system.If the injury affects the stomach and chest muscles, it may be hard to breathe and cough.The neurological level of injury determines what kind of breathing problems you may have. If the injury affects your neck and chest, you might have an increased risk of pneumonia or other lung conditions. Medicines and therapy can be helpful for treatment and prevention.",
      "Bone density.A spinal cord injury increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures below the level of injury.",
      "Muscle tone.Some people with spinal cord injuries have a tightening or motion in the muscles, known as spasticity. Other people may have soft and limp muscles lacking muscle tone, known as flaccidity.",

It's made up of nerve cells and groups of nerves that carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body. The bones of the spine surround and protect the spinal cord.",
      "A spinal cord tumor starts when cells in the spinal cord or in the tissue around it develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA tells the cells to grow and multiply at a set rate. The DNA also tells the cells to die at a set time.",
      "In tumor cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to grow and multiply quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The tumor cells form a growth that can press on the nearby nerves.",
      "Sometimes the cells develop DNA changes that turn them into cancer cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue."

The calcium deposits may never cause any problems. Aortic valve stenosis that's related to increasing age and calcium deposit buildup usually doesn't cause symptoms until age 70 or 80.

      "Sunburn symptoms often appear within a few hours after sun exposure.",

UVA is the wavelength of light that can penetrate to the deep layers of skin and lead to skin damage over time. UVB is the wavelength of light that penetrates the skin more superficially and causes sunburn.",
      "The UV light damages skin cells. The immune system reacts by increasing blood flow to the affected areas, which causes the inflamed skin (erythema) known as sunburn.",
      "You can get sunburn on cool or cloudy days. Surfaces such as snow, sand and water can reflect UV rays and burn skin too."

      "Intraductal papilloma.This is a skin tag-like growth in a milk duct. It can cause the nipple to leak clear or bloody fluid. It's usually not painful. This growth can be seen on a breast ultrasound of the area under the nipple.",
      "Lipoma.This type of lump can feel soft. It involves fatty breast tissue. It's often harmless.",
      "Breast cancer.A breast lump that's painless, hard, has irregular edges and is different from the breast tissue around it might be breast cancer. The skin covering the lump may thicken, change color or look red. There also may be skin changes such as dimpled or pitted areas that look like the skin of an orange. Your breast size and shape may change. You may notice fluid leaking from the nipple, or the nipple may turn inward. The lymph nodes under the arm or near the collarbone might be swollen.",
      "See your healthcare professional to learn what kinds of tests you might need and which type of breast lump you have."

    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Make an appointment to have a breast lump checked, especially if:",
      "The lump is new and feels firm or fixed.",
      "The lump doesn't go away after 4 to 6 weeks. Or it has changed in size or in how it feels.",
      "You notice skin changes on your breast such as a change in skin color, crusting, dimpling or puckering.",
      "Fluid comes out of the nipple suddenly on more than one occasion. The fluid might be bloody.",
      "The nipple recently turned inward.",
      "There is a new lump in your armpit, or a lump in your armpit seems to be getting bigger."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Risk factors for breast lumps caused by conditions that are not cancer include the following:",
      "Age.Some conditions that cause breast lumps are more common in the 30s and 40s. These include fibrocystic changes and fibroadenomas.",
      "Menstrual periods.Before or during your period, you may feel a breast lump due to extra fluid in the breasts.",
      "Pregnancy.Your breasts may feel lumpy during pregnancy. That's because the glands that make milk grow in number and get larger.",
      "Premenopause.As you get closer to menopause, hormone changes might make your breasts feel lumpier and tender.",
      "Some risk factors for breast cancer are within your control to change. These include:",
      "Alcohol.The more alcohol you drink, the higher the risk of breast cancer.",
      "Overweight or obesity.The risk of breast cancer rises if you're overweight or obese after menopause.",
      "A lack of exercise.If you don't get physical activity, it may make you more likely to get breast cancer.",
      "Not giving birth.The risk of breast cancer is slightly higher in people who haven't had children or who didn't have children until after age 30.",
      "Not breastfeeding.The risk of breast cancer may be slightly higher in people who don't breastfeed their babies.",
      "Hormonal birth control.Birth control methods that use hormones to prevent pregnancy may slightly raise breast cancer risk. These include birth control pills, shots and intrauterine devices.",
      "Hormone therapy.Long-term use of estrogen combined with progesterone can raise the risk of breast cancer.",
      "Other risk factors for cancerous breast lumps can't be controlled. These include:",
      "Being born female.Women are much more likely than men to get breast cancer.",
      "Aging.The risk of breast cancer rises with age. Most often, tests find breast cancer in people 55 and older.",
      "Gene changes.Some types of breast cancer are caused by genes changes passed from parents to children, also called inherited gene changes. A change in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene is the most common cause of inherited breast cancer.",
      "Family history of breast cancer.You're more likely to get breast cancer if a close relative such as a parent or sibling also had the disease.",
      "Dense breasts.This means your breasts have more glandular and fibrous tissue, and less fatty tissue. People with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer than those whose breast density is average.",
      "Early menstrual periods or later menopause.Starting your period at an early age, especially before 12, is linked with a slightly higher breast cancer risk. Going through menopause after 55 also is tied to a slightly higher risk of breast cancer.",
      "Certain breast conditions that aren't cancer.Some benign breast conditions that cause lumps can make breast cancer more likely later on. These conditions include atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia, which involve too much cell growth in certain breast cells. Another condition called lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) happens when cells grow in glands that make breast milk.LCISalso can raise the risk for breast cancer."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Some conditions that cause breast lumps may lead to other health concerns, also called complications. The complications depend on the type of breast lump that you have. For example, without treatment, some breast infections can cause pockets of pus to form in the breast.",
      "Other breast conditions that are not cancer still can raise the risk of breast cancer later on. These include conditions that can cause lumps, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. If you have a breast condition that raises the risk of cancer, it doesn't mean that you'll definitely get breast cancer. Ask your healthcare professional what the risk means for you and whether you can make lifestyle changes to lower it.",
      "Some breast lumps don't cause complications. For example, small cysts and simple fibroadenomas sometimes go away on their own over time."

Sometimes pulling out hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign. Pulling out hair is usually done in private. An episode can last from a few seconds to hours. You may try to hide your condition from others.",
      "With trichotillomania, pulling out hair can be:",
      "Automatic.You may pull out your hair without even realizing that you're doing it. This might happen, for example, when you're bored, reading or watching TV.",
      "Focused.You may pull out your hair on purpose to relieve tension or distress. You may develop specific rituals for pulling out hair, such as finding just the right hair. You may play with, bite or eat pulled-out hairs.",
      "You may do both automatic and focused hair pulling, depending on the situation and your mood. Certain positions or activities may trigger pulling out hair, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair.",
      "Trichotillomania can be related to emotions, including:",
      "Negative feelings.Pulling out hair may be a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, extreme tiredness or frustration.",
      "Positive feelings.You may find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides some relief. As a result, you may continue to pull out your hair to keep these positive feelings.",
      "Trichotillomania is a long-term disorder. If not treated, symptoms may come and go for weeks, months or years at a time. Also, symptoms can vary in severity over time. For example, hormone changes during the menstrual period can worsen symptoms in some females. Rarely, pulling out hair ends within a few years of starting."

    "Causes": [
      "The cause of trichotillomania is not clear. But like many complex disorders, trichotillomania likely results from a combination of genetic and learned factors."

    "When to see a doctor": [
      "If you can't stop pulling out your hair or you feel embarrassed or ashamed by your appearance as a result, talk to your health care provider. Trichotillomania is not just a bad habit, it's a mental health condition. It's not likely to get better without treatment."

      "Health conditions.Some people may have hair or skin conditions that feel uncomfortable. This may focus their attention toward pulling hair or picking at their scalp.",
      "Age.Trichotillomania usually develops just before or during the early teens — most often between the ages of 10 and 13 years. It's often a lifelong problem. Babies may pull out their hair, but this is usually mild and goes away on its own without treatment.",
      "Other mental health conditions.Other conditions, such as depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may occur along with trichotillomania.",
      "Stress.Severely stressful situations or events may trigger trichotillomania in some people.",
      "Environment.Boredom, isolation and privacy often increase the likelihood of hair pulling.",
      "Although far more women than men are treated for trichotillomania, this may be because women are more likely to seek medical advice. In early childhood, trichotillomania occurs just as often in boys and girls."

    "Complications": [
      "Although it may not seem serious, trichotillomania can have harmful effects on your life. Complications may include:",
      "Emotional distress.You may feel frustrated, ashamed and embarrassed because of your condition and hair loss. You may feel that you don't have control over pulling out your hair. You may experience low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and problems with alcohol or drugs.",
      "Problems in your social life and with work.Hair loss may lead you to avoid social activities and school and job opportunities. You may wear wigs, style your hair to disguise bald patches or wear false eyelashes. You may avoid intimacy to hide your condition.",
      "Skin and hair damage.Constantly pulling out hair can cause scarring, infections and other damage to the skin on your scalp or the area where hair is pulled out. This can permanently affect hair growth.",
      "Hairballs.Eating your hair may lead to a large, matted hairball that stays in your digestive tract. Over a period of years, the hairball can cause weight loss, vomiting, an intestinal block and even death."

The tumor can block the flow of fluid that helps protect the brain, causing fluid to build up around the brain. This buildup is called hydrocephalus. Symptoms can include a head size that is larger than expected, nausea, headaches and behavior changes.",
      "Heart complications.Growths in the heart, usually in infants, can block blood flow or cause problems with heart rhythm.",
      "Kidney damage.Growths in the kidney can be large and cause potentially serious — even life-threatening — kidney problems. Growths in the kidney can cause high blood pressure or bleeding or lead to kidney failure. Rarely, kidney growths can become cancerous.",

      "Increased hunger",
      "Fatigue",
      "Blurry vision",
      "Darkened areas of skin, most often around the neck or in the armpits and groin",
      "Unintended weight loss, although this is less common in children with type 2 diabetes than in children with type 1 diabetes",
      "Frequent infections"
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "The exact cause of type 2 diabetes is unknown. But family history and genetics appear to play an important role. What is clear is that children with type 2 diabetes can't process sugar (glucose) properly.",
      "Most of the sugar in the body comes from food. When food is digested, sugar enters the bloodstream. Insulin allows sugar to enter the cells — and lowers the amount of sugar in the blood.",
      "Insulin is produced by a gland located behind the stomach called the pancreas. The pancreas sends insulin to the blood when food is eaten. When the blood sugar level starts to drop, the pancreas slows down the secretion of insulin into the blood.",
      "When your child has type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work as well. As a result, instead of fueling cells, sugar builds up in your child's bloodstream. This can happen because:",
      "The pancreas may not make enough insulin",

      "Researchers don't fully understand why some children develop type 2 diabetes and others don't, even if they have similar risk factors. However, it's clear that certain factors increase the risk, including:",
      "Weight.Being overweight is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes in children. The more fatty tissue children have — especially inside and between the muscle and skin around the abdomen — the more resistant their bodies' cells become to insulin.",
      "Inactivity.The less active children are, the greater their risk of type 2 diabetes.",
      "Diet.Eating red meat and processed meat and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.",
      "Family history.Children's risk of type 2 diabetes increases if they have a parent or sibling with the disease.",
      "Race or ethnicity.Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.",
      "Age and sex.Many children develop type 2 diabetes in their early teens, but it may occur at any age. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than are adolescent boys.",
      "Maternal gestational diabetes.Children born to women who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.",
      "Low birth weight or preterm birth.Having a low birth weight is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Babies born prematurely — before 39 to 42 weeks' gestation —have a greater risk of type 2 diabetes.",

They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates. They help control body temperature. They have an effect on heart rate. And they help control how much protein the body makes.",
      "Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough hormones. Conditions or problems that can lead to hypothyroidism include:",
      "Autoimmune disease.The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's disease. Autoimmune diseases happen when the immune system makes antibodies that attack healthy tissues. Sometimes that process involves the thyroid gland and affects its ability to make hormones.",
      "Thyroid surgery.Surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland can lower the gland's ability to make thyroid hormones or stop it completely.",
      "Radiation therapy.Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect the thyroid gland and lead to hypothyroidism.",
      "Thyroiditis.Thyroiditis happens when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed. This may be due to an infection. Or it can result from an autoimmune disorder or another medical condition affecting the thyroid. Thyroiditis can trigger the thyroid to release all of its stored thyroid hormone at once. That causes a spike in thyroid activity, a condition called hyperthyroidism. Afterward, the thyroid becomes underactive.",
      "Medicine.A number of medicines may lead to hypothyroidism. One such medicine is lithium, which is used to treat some psychiatric disorders. If you're taking medicine, ask your heath care provider about its effect on the thyroid gland.",
      "Less often, hypothyroidism may be caused by:",
      "Problems present at birth.Some babies are born with a thyroid gland that doesn't work correctly. Others are born with no thyroid gland. In most cases, the reason the thyroid gland didn't develop properly is not clear. But some children have an inherited form of a thyroid disorder. Often, infants born with hypothyroidism don't have noticeable symptoms at first. That's one reason why most states require newborn thyroid screening.",
      "Pituitary disorder.A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to make enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This is usually because of a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland.",
      "Pregnancy.Some people develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy. If hypothyroidism happens during pregnancy and isn't treated, it raises the risk of pregnancy loss, premature delivery and preeclampsia. Preeclampsia causes a significant rise in blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. Hypothyroidism also can seriously affect the developing fetus.",
      "Not enough iodine.The thyroid gland needs the mineral iodine to make thyroid hormones. Iodine is found mainly in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt. Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism. Too much iodine can make hypothyroidism worse in people who already have the condition. In some parts of the world, it's common for people not to get enough iodine in their diets. The addition of iodine to table salt has almost eliminated this problem in the United States."

      "Heart problems.Hypothyroidism can lead to a higher risk of heart disease and heart failure. That's mainly because people with an underactive thyroid tend to develop high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol.",
      "Peripheral neuropathy.Hypothyroidism that goes without treatment for a long time can damage the peripheral nerves. These are the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Peripheral neuropathy may cause pain, numbness and tingling in the arms and legs.",
      "Infertility.Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which can limit fertility. Some of the causes of hypothyroidism, such as autoimmune disorders, also can harm fertility.",
      "Birth defects.Babies born to people with untreated thyroid disease may have a higher risk of birth defects compared with babies born to mothers who do not have thyroid disease.Infants with hypothyroidism present at birth that goes untreated are at risk of serious physical and mental development problems. But if the condition is diagnosed within the first few months of life, the chances of typical development are excellent.",
      "Myxedema coma.This rare, life-threatening condition can happen when hypothyroidism goes without treatment for a long time. A myxedema coma may be triggered by sedatives, infection or other stress on the body. Its symptoms include intense cold intolerance and drowsiness, followed by an extreme lack of energy and then unconsciousness. Myxedema coma requires emergency medical treatment."

      "Medicine.A number of medicines may lead to hypothyroidism. One such medicine is lithium, which is used to treat some psychiatric disorders. If you're taking medicine, ask your heath care provider about its effect on the thyroid gland.",
      "Less often, hypothyroidism may be caused by:",
      "Problems present at birth.Some babies are born with a thyroid gland that doesn't work correctly. Others are born with no thyroid gland. In most cases, the reason the thyroid gland didn't develop properly is not clear. But some children have an inherited form of a thyroid disorder. Often, infants born with hypothyroidism don't have noticeable symptoms at first. That's one reason why most states require newborn thyroid screening.",
      "Pituitary disorder.A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to make enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This is usually because of a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland.",
      "Pregnancy.Some people develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy. If hypothyroidism happens during pregnancy and isn't treated, it raises the risk of pregnancy loss, premature delivery and preeclampsia. Preeclampsia causes a significant rise in blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. Hypothyroidism also can seriously affect the developing fetus.",
      "Not enough iodine.The thyroid gland needs the mineral iodine to make thyroid hormones. Iodine is found mainly in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt. Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism. Too much iodine can make hypothyroidism worse in people who already have the condition. In some parts of the world, it's common for people not to get enough iodine in their diets. The addition of iodine to table salt has almost eliminated this problem in the United States."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "See your health care provider if you're feeling tired for no reason or if you have other symptoms of hypothyroidism.",
      "If you're taking thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism, follow your health care provider's advice on how often you need medical appointments. At first, you may need regular appointments to make sure you're receiving the right dose of medicine. Over time, you may need checkups so that your health care provider can monitor your condition and medicine."

    "Risk factors": [
      "Although anyone can develop hypothyroidism, you're at an increased risk if you:",
      "Are a woman.",
      "Have a family history of thyroid disease.",
      "Have an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes or celiac disease.",
      "Have received treatment for hyperthyroidism.",
      "Received radiation to your neck or upper chest.",
      "Have had thyroid surgery."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Hypothyroidism that isn't treated can lead to other health problems, including:",
      "Goiter.Hypothyroidism may cause the thyroid gland to become larger. This condition is called a goiter. A large goiter may cause problems with swallowing or breathing.",
      "Heart problems.Hypothyroidism can lead to a higher risk of heart disease and heart failure. That's mainly because people with an underactive thyroid tend to develop high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol.",
      "Peripheral neuropathy.Hypothyroidism that goes without treatment for a long time can damage the peripheral nerves. These are the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Peripheral neuropathy may cause pain, numbness and tingling in the arms and legs.",
      "Infertility.Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which can limit fertility. Some of the causes of hypothyroidism, such as autoimmune disorders, also can harm fertility.",
      "Birth defects.Babies born to people with untreated thyroid disease may have a higher risk of birth defects compared with babies born to mothers who do not have thyroid disease.Infants with hypothyroidism present at birth that goes untreated are at risk of serious physical and mental development problems. But if the condition is diagnosed within the first few months of life, the chances of typical development are excellent.",
      "Myxedema coma.This rare, life-threatening condition can happen when hypothyroidism goes without treatment for a long time. A myxedema coma may be triggered by sedatives, infection or other stress on the body. Its symptoms include intense cold intolerance and drowsiness, followed by an extreme lack of energy and then unconsciousness. Myxedema coma requires emergency medical treatment."

    "disease": "Urinary incontinence",
    "Symptoms": [
      "Many people experience occasional, minor leaks of urine. Others may lose small to moderate amounts of urine more frequently.",
      "Types of urinary incontinence include:",
      "Stress incontinence.Urine leaks when you exert pressure on your bladder by coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising or lifting something heavy.",
      "Urge incontinence.You have a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine. You may need to urinate often, including throughout the night. Urge incontinence may be caused by a minor condition, such as infection, or a more severe condition such as a neurological disorder or diabetes.",
      "Overflow incontinence.You experience frequent or constant dribbling of urine due to a bladder that doesn't empty completely.",
      "Functional incontinence.A physical or mental impairment keeps you from making it to the toilet in time. For example, if you have severe arthritis, you may not be able to unbutton your pants quickly enough.",
      "Mixed incontinence.You experience more than one type of urinary incontinence — most often this refers to a combination of stress incontinence and urge incontinence."

Fistulas can form for reasons such as injuries during surgery and infections after surgery. Skilled surgeons can repair injuries while operating, which lowers the risk of fistula. But complications such as fistulas are more common after surgery in people with diabetes or in people who use tobacco.Surgery to remove the uterus, called a hysterectomy, is an example of an operation that can raise the risk of a vaginal fistula. The risk is higher if the hysterectomy is more complex. For example, the risk rises if the surgery takes longer than five hours, or if it involves larger blood loss or the removal of more surrounding tissue.",
      "Childbirth injuries.A vaginal fistula could stem from tearing that sometimes happens when a baby's head comes through the opening of the vagina. Or a fistula might form due to an infection of a surgical cut made between the vagina and the anus to help deliver a baby. This cause is not common in developed countries.Being in labor a long time because the baby can't move into the birth canal can raise the risk of a vaginal fistula, mainly in developing countries. That's partly because access to emergency delivery measures such as C-section may be limited.",

      "The testicles receive oxygen-rich blood from two testicular arteries — one artery for each side of the scrotum. Similarly, there are also two testicular veins that transport oxygen-depleted blood back toward the heart. Within each side of the scrotum, a network of small veins (pampiniform plexus) transport the oxygen-depleted blood from the testicle to the main testicular vein. A varicocele is the enlargement of the pampiniform plexus.",

      "Vertebral tumors that start in the spine happen when cells in the bones of the spine develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In the tumor cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to make many more cells quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.",

    "Causes": [
      "Vocal cord paralysis happens when nerve impulses to the voice box, known as the larynx, are disrupted. This causes the muscle to become paralyzed. Often the exact cause of vocal cord paralysis isn't known. But some known causes may include:",
      "Injury to the vocal cord during surgery.Surgery on or near the neck or upper chest can result in damage to the nerves that serve the voice box. Surgeries that carry a risk of damage include surgeries to the thyroid or parathyroid glands, esophagus, neck, and chest.",
      "Neck or chest injury.Trauma to the neck or chest may injure the nerves that serve the vocal cords or the voice box itself.",
      "Stroke.A stroke interrupts blood flow in the brain and may damage the part of the brain that sends messages to the voice box.",
      "Tumors.Tumors, both cancerous and noncancerous, can grow in or around the muscles, cartilage or nerves controlling the function of the voice box. This can cause vocal cord paralysis.",
      "Infections.Some infections, such as Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus and herpes, can cause inflammation and directly damage the nerves in the voice box. There's some evidence that infection with COVID-19 may cause vocal cord paralysis.",
      "Neurological conditions.Certain neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, can lead to vocal cord paralysis."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Contact your healthcare professional if you have a hoarse voice that can't be explained and that lasts for more than 2 to 4 weeks. Also see your healthcare professional if you notice any voice changes or discomfort."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "Risk factors for vocal cord paralysis include:",
      "Having throat or chest surgery.People who need surgery on their thyroid, throat or upper chest have an increased risk of vocal cord nerve damage. Sometimes the breathing tubes used in surgery or to help people breathe when they're having serious respiratory trouble can damage the vocal cord nerves.",
      "Having a neurological condition.People with certain neurological conditions — such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis — are more likely to develop vocal cord weakness or paralysis."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Breathing problems associated with vocal cord paralysis may be so mild that you just have a hoarse-sounding voice. Or they can be so serious that they're life-threatening.",
      "Vocal cord paralysis keeps the opening to the airway from completely opening or closing. This can cause someone to choke on or inhale food or liquid, known as aspiration. Aspiration that leads to severe pneumonia is rare but serious and requires immediate medical care."

    "Symptoms": [
      "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) usually is diagnosed during childhood. Symptoms are seen at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Symptoms tend to be mild to moderate, but they can vary from person to person.",
      "Symptoms include:",
      "Flat, light brown spots on the skin, known as cafe au lait spots.These harmless spots are common in many people. But having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They often are present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing.",
      "Freckling in the armpits or groin area.Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds.",
      "Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules.These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.",
      "Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin called neurofibromas.These benign tumors usually grow in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. A growth that involves many nerves is called a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age.",
      "Bone changes.Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg.",
      "Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma.This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults.",
      "Learning disabilities.It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.",
      "Larger than average head size.Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.",
      "Short stature.Children who have NF1 often are below average in height."

    "Causes": [
      "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by an altered gene that either is passed down by a parent or occurs at conception.",
      "The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17. This gene produces a protein called neurofibromin that helps regulate cell growth. When the gene is altered, it causes a loss of neurofibromin. This allows cells to grow without control."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "See a healthcare professional if your child has symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1. The tumors are often not cancerous and are slow growing, but complications can be managed. If your child has a plexiform neurofibroma, a medicine is available to treat it."

    "Risk factors": [
      "The biggest risk factor for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a family history. For about half of people who have NF1, the disease was passed down from a parent. People who have NF1 and whose relatives aren't affected are likely to have a new change to a gene.",
      "NF1 has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means that any child of a parent who is affected by the disease has a 50% chance of having the altered gene."

      "Skeletal symptoms.Some children have bones that didn't form as usual. This can cause bowing of the legs and fractures that sometimes don't heal. NF1 can cause curvature of the spine, known as scoliosis, that may need bracing or surgery. NF1 also is associated with lower bone mineral density, which increases the risk of weak bones, known as osteoporosis.",
      "Changes in vision.Sometimes a tumor called an optic pathway glioma develops on the optic nerve. When this happens, it can affect vision.",
      "Increase in symptoms during times of hormonal change.Hormonal changes associated with puberty or pregnancy might cause an increase in neurofibromas. Most people who have NF1 have healthy pregnancies but will likely need monitoring by an obstetrician who is familiar with NF1.",
      "Cardiovascular symptoms.People who have NF1 have an increased risk of high blood pressure and may develop blood vessel conditions.",
      "Trouble breathing.Rarely, plexiform neurofibromas can put pressure on the airway.",

      "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) usually is diagnosed during childhood. Symptoms are seen at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Symptoms tend to be mild to moderate, but they can vary from person to person.",
      "Symptoms include:",
      "Flat, light brown spots on the skin, known as cafe au lait spots.These harmless spots are common in many people. But having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They often are present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing.",
      "Freckling in the armpits or groin area.Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds.",
      "Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules.These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.",
      "Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin called neurofibromas.These benign tumors usually grow in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. A growth that involves many nerves is called a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age.",
      "Bone changes.Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg.",
      "Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma.This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults.",
      "Learning disabilities.It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.",
      "Larger than average head size.Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.",
      "Short stature.Children who have NF1 often are below average in height."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by an altered gene that either is passed down by a parent or occurs at conception.",
      "The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17. This gene produces a protein called neurofibromin that helps regulate cell growth. When the gene is altered, it causes a loss of neurofibromin. This allows cells to grow without control."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "See a healthcare professional if your child has symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1. The tumors are often not cancerous and are slow growing, but complications can be managed. If your child has a plexiform neurofibroma, a medicine is available to treat it."
    ],
    "Risk factors": [
      "The biggest risk factor for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a family history. For about half of people who have NF1, the disease was passed down from a parent. People who have NF1 and whose relatives aren't affected are likely to have a new change to a gene.",
      "NF1 has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means that any child of a parent who is affected by the disease has a 50% chance of having the altered gene."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Complications of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) vary, even within the same family. Generally, complications occur when tumors affect nerve tissue or press on internal organs.",
      "Complications of NF1 include:",
      "Neurological symptoms.Trouble with learning and thinking are the most common neurological symptoms associated with NF1. Less common complications include epilepsy and the buildup of excess fluid in the brain.",
      "Concerns with appearance.Visible signs of NF1 can include widespread cafe au lait spots, many neurofibromas in the facial area or large neurofibromas. In some people this can cause anxiety and emotional distress, even if they're not medically serious.",
      "Skeletal symptoms.Some children have bones that didn't form as usual. This can cause bowing of the legs and fractures that sometimes don't heal. NF1 can cause curvature of the spine, known as scoliosis, that may need bracing or surgery. NF1 also is associated with lower bone mineral density, which increases the risk of weak bones, known as osteoporosis.",
      "Changes in vision.Sometimes a tumor called an optic pathway glioma develops on the optic nerve. When this happens, it can affect vision.",
      "Increase in symptoms during times of hormonal change.Hormonal changes associated with puberty or pregnancy might cause an increase in neurofibromas. Most people who have NF1 have healthy pregnancies but will likely need monitoring by an obstetrician who is familiar with NF1.",
      "Cardiovascular symptoms.People who have NF1 have an increased risk of high blood pressure and may develop blood vessel conditions.",
      "Trouble breathing.Rarely, plexiform neurofibromas can put pressure on the airway.",
      "Cancer.Some people who have NF1 develop cancerous tumors. These usually arise from neurofibromas under the skin or from plexiform neurofibromas. People who have NF1 also have a higher risk of other forms of cancer. They include breast cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer, brain tumors and some types of soft tissue cancer. Screening for breast cancer should begin earlier, at age 30, for women with NF1 compared to the general population.",
      "Benign adrenal gland tumor, known as a pheochromocytoma.This noncancerous tumor produces hormones that raise your blood pressure. Surgery often is needed to remove it."

      "The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air.",
      "Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin.

    "Causes": [
      "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is caused by an irregular calf muscle, usually the gastrocnemius muscle.",
      "The condition may be seen at birth, or it may occur later in life. When it's present at birth, the baby's calf muscle or nearby artery forms in the wrong place during pregnancy. People who get the condition later in life have a calf muscle that is bigger than usual.",
      "The changes in the calf muscle cause it to press on the main artery behind the knee. This reduces blood flow to the lower leg. The lack of blood flow causes pain and cramping in the back of the lower leg during times of activity."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Make an appointment for a health checkup if you have any type of leg pain. This is especially important if you have calf or foot cramping during activity that gets better with rest."

    "Risk factors": [
      "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is uncommon. The following things increase the risk of the condition.",
      "Younger age.The condition is most often seen in people who are in their late teens or 20s. It's rarely diagnosed in those over age 40.",
      "Being male.PAEScan occur in anyone, but it's much more common in young men.",
      "Strenuous athletic activity.Runners, bicyclists, and athletes who try to build muscle fast with weight training routines or high-intensity circuit training are at the highest risk."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Long-term pressure on the popliteal artery can cause the artery to narrow. This is called artery stenosis. It can cause pain and cramping with just slight activity, such as walking.",
      "In severe cases or when undiagnosed, the nerves and muscles in the leg can become damaged. Blood clots may occur in the lower leg. Older athletes with symptoms of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome should be checked for a ballooning or bulging of the artery. This is called a popliteal aneurysm. It is common in older men."

      "Easy or excessive bruising, called purpura, on the skin or inside the mouth.",
      "Pinpoint-sized dots on the skin, called petechiae, that may be red, purplish or brownish.",

      "Blood in urine or stools.",
      "Unusually heavy menstrual flows."
    ],
    "Causes": [
      "Platelets are produced in bone marrow. Each platelet lives about 7 to 10 days, so bone marrow is always renewing the supply and releasing it into the blood.",
      "Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count lower than 135,000 platelets per microliter of blood in men and lower than 157,000 platelets per microliter of blood in women. Some clinics or labs may use slightly different numbers.",
      "A large, rapid drop in platelets may result in a count higher than these targets, but this drop may still indicate a condition affecting platelet levels.",
      "The causes of a decline in a platelet count fall into three categories:",
      "Platelets are trapped and not circulating.",
      "Not enough platelets are made.",
      "Platelets are being destroyed or used up."
    ],
    "When to see a doctor": [
      "Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of thrombocytopenia.",
      "Bleeding that won't stop is a medical emergency. Seek immediate help for bleeding that can't be controlled by the usual first-aid techniques, such as applying pressure to the area."
    ],
    "Complications": [
      "Generally, the lower the platelet count, the greater the risk for complications of excessive bleeding or clotting.",
      "A platelet count is checked before having procedures that involve bleeding, such as surgery. Rarely, internal bleeding can happen without injury when a platelet count is very low."
