Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness.
Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss."

People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder.
Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills."

Inflammation and redness.The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red.
Limited range of motion.As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally."
Septic arthritis,
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"The most common signs and symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are:
Pain.While your child might not complain of joint pain, you may notice that he or she limps — especially first thing in the morning or after a nap.
Swelling.Joint swelling is common but is often first noticed in larger joints such as the knee.
Stiffness.You might notice that your child appears clumsier than usual, particularly in the morning or after naps.
Fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash.In some cases, high fever, swollen lymph nodes or a rash on the trunk may occur — which is usually worse in the evenings.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can affect one joint or many. There are several different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but the main ones are systemic, oligoarticular and polyarticular. Which type your child has depends on symptoms, the number of joints affected, and if a fever and rashes are prominent features.
Like other forms of arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis is characterized by times when symptoms flare up and times when symptoms may be minimal."

You might feel a grating sensation when you use the joint, and you might hear popping or crackling.
This might be caused by soft tissue inflammation around the joint."
Psoriatic arthritis,"Both psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis are chronic diseases that worsen over time. However, you might have periods when your symptoms improve or go away temporarily.
Psoriatic arthritis can affect joints on one or both sides of your body. The signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis often resemble those of rheumatoid arthritis. Both diseases cause joints to become painful, swollen and warm to the touch.
However, psoriatic arthritis is more likely to also cause:
Psoriatic arthritis can cause a painful, sausage-like swelling of your fingers and toes.
Psoriatic arthritis can also cause pain at the points where tendons and ligaments attach to your bones — especially at the back of your heel (Achilles tendinitis) or in the sole of your foot (plantar fasciitis).
Some people develop a condition called spondylitis as a result of psoriatic arthritis. Spondylitis mainly causes inflammation of the joints between the vertebrae of your spine and in the joints between your spine and pelvis (sacroiliitis).
Nails can form tiny dents (pits), crumble or separate from the nail beds.
Uveitis can cause eye pain, redness and blurry vision. If untreated, uveitis can lead to vision loss."
Reactive arthritis,"Inflammation often affects these sites in people with reactive arthritis.
The joint pain associated with reactive arthritis most commonly occurs in the knees, ankles and feet. Pain may also occur in the heels, low back or buttocks.
Many people who have reactive arthritis also develop eye inflammation (conjunctivitis).
This happens most often in the heels and the sole of the feet.
In some cases, toes or fingers might become so swollen that they look like sausages.
Reactive arthritis can affect skin in a variety of ways, including mouth sores and a rash on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands.
The pain tends to be worse at night or in the morning."
Rheumatoid arthritis,"Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:
Painful, warm, swollen joints.
Joint stiffness that most often is worse in the mornings and after periods of rest. It can last for 45 minutes or longer.
Tiredness, fever and not wanting to eat.
Rheumatoid arthritis may affect just a few joints at first. Most often, these are the small joints of the hands and the feet.
As the disease gets worse, symptoms may spread to more joints. These most often include the wrists, elbows, hips, knees and ankles. Most of the time, symptoms affect the same joints on both sides of the body.
Many people who have rheumatoid arthritis also have symptoms that affect more than the joints. Areas that may be affected include:
Skin.
Eyes.
Lungs.
Heart.
Nerve tissue.
Blood.
Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms may vary in how bad they are. They may come and go. Periods when the condition becomes more active, called flares, follow periods of less or no swelling and pain. This is called remission.
Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to bend out of shape and shift out of place. The joints can be hard to use for daily activities at home or at work."
Septic arthritis,
Thumb arthritis,"Pain is the first and most common symptom of thumb arthritis. Pain can occur at the base of your thumb when you grip, grasp or pinch an object, or use your thumb to apply force.

A persistent, dry cough
Chest tightness or pain
Dry and crackling sounds in your lungs when you inhale
Fingertips and toes that appear wider and rounder than usual (clubbing)"
Ascariasis,"Most people infected with ascariasis have no signs or symptoms. Moderate to heavy infestations cause various signs or symptoms, depending on which part of your body is affected.
After spending 10 to 14 days in the lungs, the larvae travel to the throat, where you cough them up and then swallow them.
The larvae mature into adult worms in the small intestine, and the adult worms typically live in the intestines until they die. In mild or moderate ascariasis, the intestinal infestation can cause:
If you have a large number of worms in the intestine, you might have:
Persistent cough
Shortness of breath
Wheezing
Vague abdominal pain
Nausea and vomiting
Diarrhea or bloody stools
Severe abdominal pain
Fatigue
Vomiting
Weight loss or malnutrition

Atrial septal defect symptoms may include:
Tiredness, especially with activity.
Swelling of the legs, feet or belly area.
Irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias.
Skipped heartbeats or feelings of a quick, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations."
Autism spectrum disorder,"Some people in the mild range on the autism spectrum may have more symptoms that aren't noticed early on. They may not be diagnosed until middle to late childhood, when there is a greater need to communicate and be social. Sometimes a diagnosis is made for the first time in adulthood, though symptoms were likely present during childhood.
Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior that depends on whether symptoms are mild, moderate or severe.
Some children with autism spectrum disorder have trouble learning, and some have signs of lower than usual intelligence. Other children with the condition have usual to high intelligence. These children learn quickly but have trouble communicating, applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations.
Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder."
Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis),"Some people have no symptoms in the early stages of avascular necrosis. As the condition worsens, affected joints might hurt only when putting weight on them. Eventually, you might feel the pain even when you're lying down.
Pain can be mild or severe. It usually develops gradually. Pain associated with avascular necrosis of the hip might center on the groin, thigh or buttock. Besides the hip, the shoulder, knee, hand and foot can be affected.
Some people develop avascular necrosis on both sides, such as in both hips or in both knees."
Aspergillosis,"The signs and symptoms of aspergillosis vary with the type of illness you develop:
Some people with asthma or cystic fibrosis have an allergic reaction to aspergillus mold. Signs and symptoms of this condition, known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, include:
Certain chronic lung (pulmonary) conditions, such as emphysema, tuberculosis or advanced sarcoidosis, can cause air spaces (cavities) to form in the lungs. When people with lung cavities are also infected with aspergillus, fungus fibers may find their way into the cavities and grow into tangled masses (fungus balls) known as aspergillomas.
Aspergillomas may produce no symptoms or cause only a mild cough at first. Over time and without treatment, however, aspergillomas can worsen the underlying chronic lung condition and possibly cause:
This is the most severe form of aspergillosis. It occurs when the infection spreads rapidly from the lungs to the brain, heart, kidneys or skin. Invasive aspergillosis occurs only in people whose immune systems are weakened as a result of cancer chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation or a disease of the immune system. Untreated, this form of aspergillosis may be fatal.
Signs and symptoms depend on which organs are affected, but in general, invasive aspergillosis can cause:
Aspergillus can invade areas of your body other than your lungs, such as your sinuses. In your sinuses, the fungus can cause a stuffy nose sometimes accompanied by drainage that may contain blood. Fever, facial pain and headache may also occur.

The result of an at-home test, called a peak flow meter, can be an important sign of an asthma attack. This device measures how quickly you can force air out of your lungs. Peak flow readings are usually a percentage of how your lungs work at their best. This is called your personal best peak flow.
An asthma action plan often includes steps to take based on a peak flow reading. A reading below 80% of a best peak flow can be a sign of an asthma attack."
Childhood asthma,"Common childhood asthma symptoms include:
Childhood asthma also might cause:
Asthma symptoms vary from child to child and might get worse or better over time. Your child might have only one symptom, such as a lingering cough or chest congestion.
It can be difficult to tell whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma. Wheezing and other asthma-like symptoms can be caused by infectious bronchitis or another respiratory problem.

The symptoms cause problems with development and daily life and may continue into adulthood.
There are three types of ADHD:
Predominately inattentive.In this type, most symptoms fall under inattention. This means having trouble focusing and staying on a task. It also includes trouble getting and staying organized.
Predominately hyperactive and impulsive.In this type, most symptoms involve being hyperactive and impulsive. Hyperactive means being too active and having too much energy. It may include disruptive behavior. Being impulsive means acting without thinking ahead about the results or effects of behavior."
Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"Some people withADHDhave fewer symptoms as they age, but some adults continue to have major symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. In adults, the main features ofADHDmay include difficulty paying attention, impulsiveness and restlessness. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.
Many adults withADHDaren't aware they have it — they just know that everyday tasks can be a challenge. Adults withADHDmay find it difficult to focus and prioritize, leading to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings or social plans.

Autism spectrum disorder,"Some people in the mild range on the autism spectrum may have more symptoms that aren't noticed early on. They may not be diagnosed until middle to late childhood, when there is a greater need to communicate and be social. Sometimes a diagnosis is made for the first time in adulthood, though symptoms were likely present during childhood.
Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior that depends on whether symptoms are mild, moderate or severe.
Some children with autism spectrum disorder have trouble learning, and some have signs of lower than usual intelligence. Other children with the condition have usual to high intelligence. These children learn quickly but have trouble communicating, applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations.
Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder."
Autoimmune epilepsy,"Symptoms of autoimmune epilepsy may begin after an illness with a fever. Seizures come on suddenly and are serious. The types of seizures that may occur include:
Focal seizures.These are the most common type of seizure in autoimmune epilepsy. Sometimes focal seizures cause a change or loss of awareness. The seizures may cause the person to stare and not respond to the environment. Other types of focal seizures don't cause a change in awareness. These seizures cause different symptoms depending on which part of the brain causes them. Focal seizures may cause one part of the body to shake. Or they may cause a feeling that his has happened before, known as déjà vu. Focal seizures also may cause nausea or vision symptoms, such as flashing lights.
Faciobrachial dystonic seizures.These seizures cause muscle contractions on one side of the face and in an arm, both on the same side of the body.
Symptoms related to seizures include:
Seizures that happen several times a day.
Seizures that don't go away with antiseizure medicines.
Seizures that last more than five minutes or that occur close together without the person regaining consciousness, known as status epilepticus.
Autoimmune epilepsy symptoms also may include:
Memory loss and trouble with thinking.
Personality and behavior changes.
Involuntary movements or clumsy movements.
Irregular eye movements."
Autoimmune encephalitis,"Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can vary from person to person. But symptoms can occur in a pattern that is predictable depending on the type of autoimmune encephalitis. Many people have a headache, fever and other symptoms of an infection followed by:
Trouble with memory.
Trouble with language, such as talking less or repeating words or phrases.
Movements that are not voluntary.
Seizures.
Changes in consciousness.
Sometimes AE causes serious seizures that need emergency care, known as status epilepticus. These seizures last more than five minutes or occur one after another while the person is not conscious."

Pale stools or stools that float in the toilet.
Yellow skin and eyes, called jaundice.
Pain in your upper belly or middle part of your back.
Nausea and vomiting.
Loss of appetite or feelings of fullness.

The most common sign of type 1AIPis painless jaundice. About 80% of people with type 1AIPhave painless jaundice. This is caused by blocked bile ducts. People with type 2AIPcan have repeat episodes of acute pancreatitis. Pain in the upper abdomen, a common symptom of pancreatic cancer, is often absent in autoimmune pancreatitis.
Differences between type 1 and type 2AIPare:
In type 1AIP, the disease may affect other organs in addition to the pancreas. Type 2AIPaffects only the pancreas. Type 2 disease also is associated with another autoimmune condition called inflammatory bowel disease.
Type 2AIPaffects both men and women equally and has a younger age of onset compared with type 1AIP.
Type 1AIPis more likely to relapse after treatment is discontinued."
Autonomic neuropathy,"Signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy depend on which nerves are damaged. They might include:
such as difficulty starting urination, loss of bladder control, difficulty sensing a full bladder and inability to completely empty the bladder. Not being able to completely empty the bladder can lead to urinary tract infections.
including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm.
such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heartburn. These problems are all due to changes in digestive function.
low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there.
such as sweating too much or too little. These problems affect the ability to regulate body temperature.
making it difficult to adjust from light to dark and seeing well when driving at night.
which can occur if your heart rate stays the same instead of adjusting to your activity level."
Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis),"Some people have no symptoms in the early stages of avascular necrosis. As the condition worsens, affected joints might hurt only when putting weight on them. Eventually, you might feel the pain even when you're lying down.
Pain can be mild or severe. It usually develops gradually. Pain associated with avascular necrosis of the hip might center on the groin, thigh or buttock. Besides the hip, the shoulder, knee, hand and foot can be affected.
Some people develop avascular necrosis on both sides, such as in both hips or in both knees."
Bird flu (avian influenza),"Bird flu symptoms can be mild to serious in a person. Symptoms typically show up within seven days of contact with the virus but can take as long as two weeks. A person can get infected from direct contact with an infected animal, or the bedding or stool of the animal.

Common bird flu symptoms include:
Fever.
Problems breathing.
Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis.
Upset stomach and vomiting.
Loose stool, called diarrhea.
Bird flu may cause breathing problems more often than other kinds of flu. And during bird flu pandemics, the risk that a person with flu will need a machine to help them breathe is higher."

Fainting or almost fainting.
Symptoms of AVNRT may be mild in children. Some symptoms include sweating, trouble feeding, changes in skin color and a fast heartbeat."
Baby acne,"Baby acne is small, inflamed bumps on a baby's face, neck, back or chest. It often develops within 2 to 4 weeks of birth.
Many babies also develop tiny, pimple-like bumps on the face. These harmless spots are called milia. They disappear on their own within a few weeks.
Another condition that might be mistaken for baby acne is benign cephalic pustulosis (BCP), also called neonatal cephalic pustulosis. A bad reaction to yeast on the skin causes BCP.
None of these conditions is caused by the type of bacterium that causes acne in teens and adults."
Back pain,"Back pain can range from a muscle ache to a shooting, burning or stabbing feeling. Also, the pain can radiate down a leg. Bending, twisting, lifting, standing or walking can make pain worse."

Gradual thinning on top of head.This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia).
Circular or patchy bald spots.Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out.
Sudden loosening of hair.A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary.
Full-body hair loss.Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back.
Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp.This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing."
Folliculitis,"Folliculitis signs and symptoms include:
Superficial folliculitis can look like a pus-filled bump.
Hot tub folliculitis causes round, itchy bumps that may later develop into small pus-filled blisters. The rash is likely to be worse in areas where your swimsuit holds water against the skin.
Razor bumps affect people with curly beards. The condition is also called pseudofolliculitis barbae. It develops when shaved hairs curve back into the skin, leading to inflammation.
A carbuncle is a cluster of boils painful, pus-filled bumps that form a connected area of infection under the skin.
The two main types of folliculitis are superficial and deep. The superficial type involves part of the follicle, and the deep type involves the entire follicle and is usually more severe.
Types of folliculitis, with the most common listed first, include:
Clusters of small bumps or pimples around hair follicles
Pus-filled blisters that break open and crust over
Itchy, burning skin
Painful, tender skin
An inflamed bump
This common type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps. It occurs when hair follicles become infected with bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus (staph). Staph bacteria live on the skin all the time. And they can cause problems when they enter the body through a cut or other wound.
This type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps, most often on the back and chest. It's caused by a yeast infection.
This type causes pus-filled bumps around the nose and mouth. It sometimes develops in people who are receiving long-term antibiotic therapy for acne.
This type causes intense itching and recurring patches of bumps and pimples that form near hair follicles of the face and upper body. It mainly affects people with HIV/AIDS. The cause of this condition isn't fully understood.
These occur when hair follicles become deeply infected with staph bacteria. A boil tends to appear suddenly as a painful inflamed bump. A carbuncle is a cluster of boils.
This type affects people who shave."
Mitral valve prolapse,"Signs and symptoms of mitral valve prolapse are due to the amount of blood leaking backward through the valve.
Mitral valve prolapse symptoms can vary widely from one person to another. Many people with mitral valve prolapse don't have noticeable symptoms. Other people may have mild symptoms that develop gradually.
Symptoms of mitral valve prolapse may include:
A racing or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)

Joints.Joint swelling and pain often affect the knees in people with Behcet disease. The ankles, elbows or wrists also might be involved. Symptoms can last 1 to 3 weeks and go away on their own.
Blood vessels.Swelling, called inflammation, in veins and arteries can cause redness and pain. It can cause a blood clot, which leads to swelling in the arms or legs. Inflammation in the large arteries can lead to complications. These include bulges in the artery that can burst, called aneurysms, and narrowed or blocked blood vessels.

Compulsive gambling,"Signs and symptoms of compulsive gambling (gambling disorder) can include:
Most casual gamblers stop when losing or set a limit on how much they're willing to lose. But people with a compulsive gambling problem are compelled to keep playing to recover their money — a pattern that becomes increasingly destructive over time. Some people may turn to theft or fraud to get gambling money.
Some people with a compulsive gambling problem may have periods of remission — a length of time where they gamble less or not at all. But without treatment, the remission usually isn't permanent.
Being preoccupied with gambling, such as constantly planning gambling activities and how to get more gambling money
Needing to gamble with increasing amounts of money to get the same thrill
Trying to control, cut back or stop gambling, without success
Feeling restless or irritable when you try to cut down on gambling
Trying to get back lost money by gambling more (chasing losses)
Asking others to bail you out of financial trouble because you gambled money away"
Hoarding disorder,"The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things.
As you grow older, you may continue getting and holding onto things that you may never use and don't have space for. By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat.
Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others.
Symptoms of hoarding disorder may include:
Getting and keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for.
Ongoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value.
Feeling a need to save these items and being upset by the thought of getting rid of them.
Building up clutter to the point where you can't use rooms.
Trying to be perfect and avoiding or delaying decisions.
Problems with planning and organizing.
Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in:
Items that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas. Rooms can't be used for the intended purpose, such as not being able to sleep in your bed.
Buildup of food or trash to large, unsanitary levels.
Distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home.
Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home.
Relationship issues, avoiding social activities and employment problems.
Difficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter.
With hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because:
You believe these items are unique or that you'll need them at some point in the future.
You feel emotionally connected to items that remind you of happier times or represent beloved people or pets.
You feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things.
You don't want to waste anything.
Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder."
Binge-eating disorder,"If you have binge-eating disorder, you may be overweight or obese, or you may be at a healthy weight. Most people with binge-eating disorder feel upset about their body size or shape no matter what the number on the scale is.

Eating even when you're full or not hungry.
Eating very fast during eating binges.
Eating until you're uncomfortably full.
Often eating alone or in secret.
How much eating binges affect your mood and ability to function in daily life gives an idea of how serious the condition is for you. Binge-eating disorder can vary over time. The condition may be short-lived, may go away and come back, or may continue for years if left untreated."

Cystic fibrosis,"In the U.S., because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the symptoms of CF show up.
CF symptoms vary, depending on which organs are affected and how severe the condition is. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or get better at different times. Some people may not have symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood.
People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder symptoms and are more likely to have symptoms that aren't typical. These may include repeated bouts of an inflamed pancreas called pancreatitis, infertility and repeated bouts of pneumonia.
People with CF have a higher than usual level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system."

People who are more likely to have symptoms of a CMV infection include:
CMV infection can cause illness when you're first infected. This is called a primary infection. The risk of a baby being born with CMV is higher when the pregnant parent gets a primary infection. If you're healthy, CMV mainly stays dormant. That means the virus doesn't become active and make copies of itself. But in people with weakened immune systems, CMV can become active again when the body's defenses can't keep it dormant.
Most babies who have congenital CMV appear healthy at birth.
A few babies with congenital CMV who appear healthy at birth get symptoms over time. Sometimes, the symptoms start months or years after birth. The most common of these late symptoms are hearing loss and delays in development. A small number of babies also may develop vision loss.

Newborns who became infected with CMV before they were born. This condition is called congenital CMV.
Infants who become infected during birth or shortly afterward, also called perinatal CMV. This group includes babies infected through breast milk.
People who have weakened immune systems. This includes people who've had an organ, bone marrow, or stem cell transplant, or those who have HIV.

Dementia,Dementia symptoms vary depending on the cause. Common symptoms include:
Frontotemporal dementia,People with frontotemporal dementia tend to have clusters of symptom types that occur together. They also may have more than one cluster of symptom types.
Lewy body dementia,"Lewy body dementia symptoms can include:
Visual hallucinations.Seeing things that aren't there, known as hallucinations, might be one of the first symptoms of Lewy body dementia. This symptom often occurs regularly. People with Lewy body dementia might see shapes, animals or people that aren't there. Hallucinations involving sounds, smells or touch are possible.
Movement disorders.Signs of Parkinson's disease, known as parkinsonian signs, may occur. These symptoms include slowed movement, rigid muscles, tremor or a shuffling walk. This can cause the person to fall.
Cognitive problems.People with Lewy body dementia might have thinking problems similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. They may include confusion, poor attention, visual-spatial problems and memory loss.
Trouble with sleep.People with Lewy body dementia can have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. This disorder causes people to physically act out their dreams while asleep. People withREMsleep behavior disorder may punch, kick, yell or scream while sleeping.

Apathy.Loss of motivation may occur."
Vascular dementia,"Vascular dementia symptoms vary, depending on the part of your brain where blood flow is impaired. Symptoms often overlap with those of other types of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease dementia. But unlike Alzheimer's disease, the most significant symptoms of vascular dementia tend to involve speed of thinking and problem-solving rather than memory loss.
Vascular dementia signs and symptoms include:
Vascular dementia symptoms may be most clear-cut when they occur suddenly following a stroke. When changes in your thinking and reasoning seem clearly linked to a stroke, this condition is sometimes called post-stroke dementia.
Sometimes a characteristic pattern of vascular dementia symptoms follows a series of strokes or ministrokes. Changes in your thought processes occur in noticeable steps downward from your previous level of function, unlike the gradual, steady decline that typically occurs in Alzheimer's disease dementia.
But vascular dementia can also develop very gradually, just like Alzheimer's disease dementia. What's more, vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease often occur together.
Studies show that many people with dementia and evidence of brain vascular disease also have Alzheimer's disease.

Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death.
Warning signs of severe dengue fever — which is a life-threatening emergency — can develop quickly. The warning signs usually begin the first day or two after your fever goes away, and may include:
Severe stomach pain
Persistent vomiting
Bleeding from your gums or nose
Blood in your urine, stools or vomit
Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising
Difficult or rapid breathing
Fatigue

In some people, infection with diphtheria-causing bacteria causes only a mild illness — or no obvious signs and symptoms at all. Infected people who stay unaware of their illness are known as carriers of diphtheria. They're called carriers because they can spread the infection without being sick themselves.
A second type of diphtheria can affect the skin, causing pain, redness and swelling similar to other bacterial skin infections. Ulcers covered by a gray membrane also may be a sign of skin diphtheria.
Although it's more common in tropical climates, diphtheria on the skin also occurs in the United States. It may happen especially among people with poor hygiene who live in crowded conditions.

Difficulty recognizing faces.
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.
Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness.
Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss."

Nearby objects may appear blurry
You need to squint to see clearly
You have eyestrain, including burning eyes, and aching in or around the eyes
You have general eye discomfort or a headache after doing close tasks, such as reading, writing, computer work or drawing, for a time"
Factitious disorder,"Factitious disorder symptoms involve people trying to look ill, making themselves ill or hurting themselves. They also may fake symptoms, make symptoms seem worse than they are or pretend they can't do certain things because of their symptoms so they can deceive others. People with the condition work hard to hide their lies. It may be hard to know that their symptoms are part of a serious mental health condition. People with this condition continue with the lies, even without any benefit or reward, or when faced with evidence that doesn't support their claims.
Factitious disorder symptoms may include:
Clever and convincing medical or mental health problems.
Deep knowledge of medical terms and diseases.
Vague symptoms or symptoms that aren't consistent.
Conditions that get worse for no clear reason.
Seeking treatment from many healthcare professionals or hospitals, which may include using a fake name.
Not wanting healthcare professionals to talk to family or friends or other healthcare professionals.
Staying in the hospital a lot.
Desire for frequent testing or risky surgeries and procedures.
Many surgical scars or evidence of many procedures.
Having few visitors when in the hospital.
Arguing with healthcare professionals and staff."
Febrile seizure,"Usually, a child having a febrile seizure shakes all over and loses consciousness. Sometimes, the child may get very stiff or twitch in just one area of the body.
A child having a febrile seizure may:
Febrile seizures most often occur within 24 hours of the onset of a fever and can be the first sign that a child is ill.
Have a fever higher than 100.4 F (38.0 C)
Lose consciousness
Shake or jerk the arms and legs
This most common type lasts from a few seconds to 15 minutes. Simple febrile seizures do not recur within a 24-hour period and are not specific to one part of the body.
This type lasts longer than 15 minutes, occurs more than once within 24 hours or is confined to one side of your child's body."
Fuchs dystrophy,"As Fuchs dystrophy gets worse, symptoms often affect both eyes. Symptoms may include:
Blurred or cloudy vision, sometimes described as a lack of clear vision.
Changes in vision throughout the day. Symptoms are worse in the morning when you wake up and slowly get better during the day. As the disease gets worse, blurred vision may take longer to get better or does not get better at all.
Glare, which can decrease your vision in dim and bright light.
Seeing halos around lights.
Pain or grittiness from tiny blisters on the surface of your cornea."
Fecal incontinence,"The main symptom is not being able to control passing stool. This may happen during a short-term illness that causes diarrhea. For some people, fecal incontinence is an ongoing condition.
There are two types of fecal incontinence:
Urge incontinenceis the sudden urge to pass stool but not being able to control the urge. The need to pass stool may come on so suddenly that it's not possible to get to the toilet in time.
Passive incontinenceis passing stool when a person isn't aware of the need to pass stool. A person may not be able to feel that the rectum is full of stool.
Fecal incontinence also may be leakage of stool when a person passes gas."
Fuchs dystrophy,"As Fuchs dystrophy gets worse, symptoms often affect both eyes. Symptoms may include:
Blurred or cloudy vision, sometimes described as a lack of clear vision.

Female sexual dysfunction,
Fetal alcohol syndrome,
Fetal macrosomia,"Fetal macrosomia can be difficult to detect and diagnose during pregnancy. Signs and symptoms include:
The amount of amniotic fluid reflects your baby's urine output, and a larger baby produces more urine. Some conditions that cause a baby to be larger might also increase his or her urine output.
Fundal height is the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus measured in centimeters. After 24 weeks of pregnancy, fundal height often matches the number of weeks you've been pregnant."
Fever,"Body temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.
Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
To take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.
Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.
In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.

Oozing and crusting.The small blisters may merge and then burst. This can leave shallow open sores that ooze and crust over.
Fever.
Painful gums.
Sore throat.
Headache.
Muscle aches.
Swollen lymph nodes."
Valley fever,"Valley fever is the initial form of coccidioidomycosis infection. This initial, acute illness can develop into a more serious disease, including chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis.
If you develop symptoms, especially severe ones, the course of the disease is highly variable. It can take months to fully recover. Fatigue and joint aches can last even longer. The disease's severity depends on several factors, including your overall health and the number of fungus spores you inhale.
If the initial coccidioidomycosis infection doesn't completely resolve, it may progress to a chronic form of pneumonia. This complication is most common in people with weakened immune systems.
Signs and symptoms include:
The most serious form of the disease, disseminated coccidioidomycosis, is uncommon. It occurs when the infection spreads (disseminates) beyond the lungs to other parts of the body. Most often these parts include the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord (meninges).
Signs and symptoms of disseminated disease depend on the body parts affected and may include:
Fever
Cough
Tiredness
Shortness of breath
Headache
Chills
Night sweats

Familial hypercholesterolemia,"Adults and children who have familial hypercholesterolemia have very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in their blood. low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is known as ""bad"" cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of the arteries, making them hard and narrow.
The most common spots for cholesterol deposits to occur is on the hands, elbows and knees. They also can occur in the skin around the eyes.
Cholesterol deposits may thicken the Achilles tendon, along with some tendons in the hands.
High cholesterol levels can cause corneal arcus, a white or gray ring around the iris of the eye. This happens most commonly in older people, but it can occur in younger people who have familial hypercholesterolemia."
Fibroadenoma,"A fibroadenoma is a solid breast lump that often causes no pain. It is:
Round with distinct, smooth borders
Easily moved
Firm or rubbery
A fibroadenoma often grows slowly. The average size is about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). A fibroadenoma can get bigger over time. It may be tender or cause soreness a few days before your period. A large fibroadenoma may hurt when you touch it. But most often, this type of breast lump causes no pain.
You can have a single fibroadenoma or more than one fibroadenoma. They can occur in one or both breasts.
Some fibroadenomas shrink over time. Most fibroadenomas in adolescents shrink over many months to a few years. They then disappear. Fibroadenomas may also change shape over time.
Fibroadenomas may get bigger during pregnancy. They might shrink after menopause."
Fibrocystic breasts,"Signs and symptoms of fibrocystic breasts may include:

Frequent urination or trouble urinating.
Growing stomach area.
Constipation.
Rarely, a fibroid can cause sudden, serious pain when it outgrows its blood supply and starts to die.

Influenza (flu),"The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.
Symptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.
Other common flu symptoms include:
Fever.

This common type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps. It occurs when hair follicles become infected with bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus (staph). Staph bacteria live on the skin all the time. And they can cause problems when they enter the body through a cut or other wound.
This type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps, most often on the back and chest. It's caused by a yeast infection.
This type causes pus-filled bumps around the nose and mouth. It sometimes develops in people who are receiving long-term antibiotic therapy for acne.
This type causes intense itching and recurring patches of bumps and pimples that form near hair follicles of the face and upper body. It mainly affects people with HIV/AIDS. The cause of this condition isn't fully understood.
These occur when hair follicles become deeply infected with staph bacteria. A boil tends to appear suddenly as a painful inflamed bump. A carbuncle is a cluster of boils.
This type affects people who shave."

Broken leg,"The thighbone (femur) is the strongest bone in the body. It is usually obvious when the thighbone is broken because it takes so much force to break. But a break in the shinbone (tibia) or in the bone that runs alongside the shinbone (fibula) may be less obvious.
Signs and symptoms of a broken leg may include:
Severe pain, which may worsen with movement
Swelling
Tenderness
Bruising
Obvious deformity or shortening of the affected leg
Inability to walk"
Stress fractures,"At first, you might barely notice the pain from a stress fracture. But it tends to become worse if you do more of an activity that puts stress on the cracked bone.

Patches of skin in shades of red, white, blue, gray, purple or brown. The color of affected skin depends on how serious the frostbite is and the usual skin color.
Clumsiness due to joint stiffness.
Pain.
Blistering after rewarming.
Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, ears, cheeks, penis, chin and tip of the nose. Because of numbness, you may not notice you have frostbite until someone points it out. Changes in the color of the affected area might be difficult to see on brown and Black skin.
Frostbite occurs in several stages:
Frostnip.Frostnip is the early stage of frostbite. Symptoms are pain, tingling and numbness. Frostnip doesn't cause permanent damage to the skin.
Mild to moderate frostbite.Frostbite causes slight changes in skin color. The skin may begin to feel warm. This is a sign of serious skin involvement. If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of the skin may look patchy. The affected area may sting, burn and swell. A fluid-filled blister may form 12 to 36 hours after rewarming. This stage also is called superficial frostbite.
Deep frostbite.As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin and the tissues below. The affected skin turns white or blue-gray. Large blood blisters may appear 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. Weeks after the injury, tissue may turn black and hard as it dies."
Frozen shoulder,"Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly in three stages.
Freezing stage.Any movement of the shoulder causes pain, and the shoulder's ability to move becomes limited. This stage lasts from 2 to 9 months.
Frozen stage.Pain might lessen during this stage. However, the shoulder becomes stiffer. Using it becomes more difficult. This stage lasts from 4 to 12 months.
Thawing stage.The shoulder's ability to move begins to improve. This stage lasts from 5 to 24 months.

Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include:
Gradual thinning on top of head.This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia).
Circular or patchy bald spots.Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out.
Sudden loosening of hair.A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary.
Full-body hair loss.Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back.
Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp.This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing."

Biting, chewing or eating pulled-out hair.
Playing with pulled-out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face.
Repeatedly trying to stop pulling out your hair or trying to do it less often without success.
Often trichotillomania also includes picking your skin, biting your nails or chewing your lips. Sometimes pulling out hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign. Pulling out hair is usually done in private. An episode can last from a few seconds to hours. You may try to hide your condition from others.
With trichotillomania, pulling out hair can be:
Focused.You may pull out your hair on purpose to relieve tension or distress. You may develop specific rituals for pulling out hair, such as finding just the right hair. You may play with, bite or eat pulled-out hairs.
You may do both automatic and focused hair pulling, depending on the situation and your mood. Certain positions or activities may trigger pulling out hair, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair.
Trichotillomania can be related to emotions, including:
Positive feelings.You may find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides some relief. As a result, you may continue to pull out your hair to keep these positive feelings."

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease,"Hand-foot-and-mouth disease may cause all of the following symptoms or only some of them. They include:
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease often causes a rash of painful, blister-like lesions on the palms of the hands. Rashes appear differently depending on skin tone.
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease often causes a rash of painful, blister-like lesions on the soles of the feet. Rashes appear differently depending on skin tone.
The usual period from initial infection to the time symptoms appear (incubation period) is 3 to 6 days. Children may get a fever and develop a sore throat. They sometimes lose their appetites and don't feel well.
One or two days after the fever begins, painful sores may develop in the front of the mouth or throat. A rash on the hands and feet and sometimes on the buttocks may also appear.
Sores that develop in the back of the mouth and throat may suggest a related viral illness called herpangina. Other features of herpangina include a sudden high fever and, in some instances, seizure. In rare cases, sores develop on the hands, feet or other parts of the body.

Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis,"Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause symptoms.
Atherosclerosis symptoms usually don't happen until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't send enough blood to organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow. The clot may break apart. If this happens, it may cause a heart attack or stroke.
In the arteries leading to your brain,you may have sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, trouble speaking, slurred speech, sudden or temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These are symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Untreated, a TIA can lead to a stroke."

You may be able to see the lice, but they're often hard to spot because they're small, avoid light and move quickly.
Nits stick to hair shafts and may be hard to see because they're very tiny. They're easiest to spot around the ears and the hairline of the neck. Empty nits may be easier to spot because they're lighter in color and further from the scalp. However, the presence of nits doesn't mean there are live lice.
Scratching can lead to small, red bumps that may sometimes get infected with bacteria."

Heat rash,"Adults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin. In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin.
Eccrine sweat glands occur over most of the body and open directly onto the skin's surface. Apocrine glands open into the hair follicle, leading to the surface of the skin. Apocrine glands develop in areas with many hair follicles, such as on the scalp, armpits and groin. Eccrine sweat glands are involved in hyperhidrosis, though apocrine glands may play a role as well.
The types of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptoms for each type vary.
The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bumps that break easily.
A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptoms include small, inflamed blister-like bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area.
Occasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa.

The liver is your largest internal organ. About the size of a football, it's located mainly in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and above your stomach.
When a liver hemangioma causes signs and symptoms, they may include:
However, these symptoms are nonspecific and in most instances are due to something else even if you have a liver hemangioma, as these tend to be asymptomatic.
Pain in the upper right abdomen
Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food (early satiety)
Nausea
Vomiting"
Intracranial hematoma,"Symptoms of an intracranial hematoma may develop right after a head injury, or they may take weeks or longer to appear. There may be a period of time without symptoms after a head injury. This is called the lucid interval.

Vomiting.
Drowsiness and gradual loss of consciousness.
Dizziness.
Confusion.
Pupils that are different sizes.
Slurred speech.
Loss of movement, known as paralysis, on the opposite side of the body from the head injury.As more blood fills the brain or the narrow space between the brain and skull, other symptoms may appear, such as:Feeling very sleepy or sluggish.Seizures.Loss of consciousness.
Feeling very sleepy or sluggish.
Seizures.
Loss of consciousness."
Blood in urine (hematuria),"Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red.

Hemifacial spasm,"Common symptoms of hemifacial spasm include jerking of muscles in the face that are most often:
On one side of the face.
Not controllable.
Painless.
These muscle movements, also called contractions, often start in the eyelid. Then they might move on to the cheek and mouth on the same side of the face. At first, hemifacial spasms come and go. But over months to years, they occur almost all the time.
Sometimes, hemifacial spasms occur on both sides of the face. However, the twitching doesn't occur on both sides of the face at the same time."

Diarrhea, which is often bloody.
Pain, cramping or bloating in the stomach area.
Fever.

All forms of hemolytic uremic syndrome damage blood vessels. This damage causes red blood cells to break down, called anemia. The condition also causes blood clots to form in the blood vessels and, in turn, damage the kidneys.
Symptoms of these changes include:
Loss of color in the skin.
Easy bruising.

Hoarding disorder,"The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things.
As you grow older, you may continue getting and holding onto things that you may never use and don't have space for. By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat.
Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others.
Symptoms of hoarding disorder may include:
Getting and keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for.
Ongoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value.
Feeling a need to save these items and being upset by the thought of getting rid of them.
Building up clutter to the point where you can't use rooms.
Trying to be perfect and avoiding or delaying decisions.
Problems with planning and organizing.
Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in:
Items that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas. Rooms can't be used for the intended purpose, such as not being able to sleep in your bed.
Buildup of food or trash to large, unsanitary levels.
Distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home.
Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home.
Relationship issues, avoiding social activities and employment problems.
Difficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter.
With hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because:
You believe these items are unique or that you'll need them at some point in the future.
You feel emotionally connected to items that remind you of happier times or represent beloved people or pets.
You feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things.
You don't want to waste anything.
Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder."
Laryngitis,"In most cases laryngitis symptoms last less than a couple of weeks and are caused by something minor, such as a virus. Less often, laryngitis symptoms are caused by something more serious or long lasting. Laryngitis signs and symptoms can include:

HPV infection,"Usually, the body's immune system defeats an HPV infection before it creates warts. Different types of HPV produce different warts, including:
In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain. But they might itch or feel tender.
Common warts can grow on hands or fingers. They're small, grainy bumps that are rough to the touch. They're usually flesh-colored, white, pink or tan.
Plantar warts are caused by the same type of virus that causes warts on the hands and fingers. But, because of where they are, they can be painful.
Flat warts are smaller and smoother than other warts. They generally occur on the face or legs. They're more common in children and teens than in adults.
HPV infections cause almost all cervical cancers. But cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an HPV infection. The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don't cause symptoms. Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is the best way to protect against cervical cancer.
Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to keep having Pap tests every three years. Or the Pap test can be every five years for women who also get an HPV DNA test at the same time. Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three regular Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no irregular results.
Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps. They usually occur on the hands and fingers. Most common warts are simply not attractive. But they also can be painful. And it's easy for them to get injured or bleed.
Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of the feet. These warts might cause discomfort.
Flat warts are flat-topped, slightly raised sores called lesions. They can appear anywhere on the body. But children usually get them on the face, men tend to get them in the beard area, and women tend to get them on the legs."

HPV infection,"Usually, the body's immune system defeats an HPV infection before it creates warts. Different types of HPV produce different warts, including:
In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain. But they might itch or feel tender.
Common warts can grow on hands or fingers. They're small, grainy bumps that are rough to the touch. They're usually flesh-colored, white, pink or tan.
Plantar warts are caused by the same type of virus that causes warts on the hands and fingers. But, because of where they are, they can be painful.
Flat warts are smaller and smoother than other warts. They generally occur on the face or legs. They're more common in children and teens than in adults.

Other common flu symptoms include:
Fever.
Cough.
Headache.

Common bird flu symptoms include:
Fever.
Problems breathing.
Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis.

There are over 30 types of muscular dystrophy. Here are some of the main types along with key symptoms.
This is the most common form. Girls can carry the gene change that causes the disease, and some have symptoms. But this type of muscular dystrophy is much more common in boys.
Most often, the symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy start in early childhood. The symptoms can include challenges with movement, such as:
Other symptoms can include:
The symptoms of this type are like those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but Becker muscular dystrophy tends to be milder, and it becomes worse more slowly. In general, symptoms start in the teens or early adulthood. They might not occur until the mid-20s or later.
Age range at which the symptoms start.
Muscle groups that are affected.
Late walking.
Frequent falls.
Trouble rising from the floor or a lying or seated position.
Trouble running, jumping or climbing stairs.
Waddling gait.
Walking on the toes or the balls of the feet.
Large calf muscles.
Muscle pain and stiffness.
Learning or behavior-related challenges.
Delayed growth.
The symptoms of this type often start by age 10. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy causes certain joints to become stiff. Early on, some children may walk on their toes due to stiff tendons in the heels. They also may have trouble bending the elbows. This type of muscular dystrophy also causes muscles in the shoulders, upper arms and calves to slowly waste and weaken. Some people with the disease develop heart conditions that can cause fainting. Heart conditions need to be watched closely by a healthcare team.
FSHD) With this type, muscle weakness usually starts in the face, shoulders and upper arms. The weakness often affects one side of the body more than the other. When muscles around the eyes are affected, that can cause trouble fully closing the eyelids and lead to dryness of the eye. When the shoulders are affected, the shoulder blades might stick out like wings when the arms are raised. Sometimes, mild hearing loss also may occur. The symptoms of FSHD tend to start in the teenage years.
There are many types of congenital MD. These types cause symptoms at birth or before age 2. Most children with congenital muscular dystrophy have muscle weakness that becomes worse. But some forms of congenital muscular dystrophy progress slowly and cause mild disability. Others become worse quickly and cause serious health challenges. Babies with muscle weakness or lack of muscle tone can seem ""floppy."" Later on, babies and toddlers might take longer than usual to roll over, sit up or walk. Or they might not meet certain milestones of development at all.
This type often affects muscles around the shoulders and hips. Some people with limb-girdle dystrophy develop minor disabilities over time. Others develop serious trouble using their arms or legs to do everyday activities, such as walking or carrying things. The age at which symptoms start, how serious they become and how quickly they get worse varies.
This type tends to weaken the eyelids and the throat muscles. It's also been linked with muscle weakness in the limbs and near the center of the body from top to bottom. It can cause trouble swallowing, weakness of the tongue and drooping eyelids. In time, some people also have trouble with movement. Symptoms often start in the 40s and 50s, and they become worse slowly."

Heat rash,"Adults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin. In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin.
Eccrine sweat glands occur over most of the body and open directly onto the skin's surface. Apocrine glands open into the hair follicle, leading to the surface of the skin. Apocrine glands develop in areas with many hair follicles, such as on the scalp, armpits and groin. Eccrine sweat glands are involved in hyperhidrosis, though apocrine glands may play a role as well.
The types of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptoms for each type vary.
The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bumps that break easily.
A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptoms include small, inflamed blister-like bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area.
Occasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa.
A less common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda. It affects the deepest layer of the skin (dermis). It causes firm, painful or itchy inflamed bumps that look like goose bumps and may break open."
Milk allergy,"Milk allergy symptoms, which differ from person to person, occur a few minutes to a few hours after you or your child drinks milk or eats milk products.
Immediate signs and symptoms of milk allergy might include:
Signs and symptoms that may take more time to develop include:
A true milk allergy differs from milk protein intolerance and lactose intolerance. Unlike milk allergy, intolerance doesn't involve the immune system. Milk intolerance requires different treatment from true milk allergy.
Common signs and symptoms of milk protein intolerance or lactose intolerance include digestive problems, such as bloating, gas or diarrhea, after consuming milk or products containing milk.
If you or your child has a reaction to milk, tell your health care provider, no matter how mild the reaction. Tests can help confirm milk allergy, so you can avoid future and potentially worse reactions.

Movement disorders,"Symptoms of movement disorders vary depending on the type of the disorder. Common types of movement disorders and their symptoms include:
Dystonia.This condition involves involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting, irregular postures, or movements that occur again and again. Dystonia may affect the entire body or one part of the body.The most common type of dystonia in adults is cervical dystonia. In cervical dystonia, the neck muscles contract involuntarily. This causes the head to pull to one side or to tilt forward or backward. The head also may shake, known as a tremor.
Functional movement disorder.This condition may look like any of the movement disorders. But it's not caused by a disease of the nervous system, also known as a neurological disease. Functional movement disorders are treatable.
Myoclonus.Myoclonus are very quick jerks of a muscle.
Parkinson's disease.Parkinson's disease causes tremors, muscle stiffness, slow or decreased movement, or loss of balance. It also can cause symptoms not related to movement. These symptoms include a reduced sense of smell, constipation, acting out dreams and a decline in thinking skills. Parkinson's disease slowly gets worse over time.
Parkinsonism.Parkinsonism is a general term for slowness of movement along with stiffness, tremors or loss of balance. There are many different causes. Parkinson's disease and certain dopamine blocking medicines are the most common causes. Other causes include degenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. Stroke or repeated head trauma also can cause parkinsonism.
Progressive supranuclear palsy.This is a rare nervous system condition that causes problems with walking, balance and eye movements. It may resemble Parkinson's disease but is a distinct condition.
Tardive dyskinesia.This neurological condition is caused by long-term use of certain medicines used to treat mental health conditions, called neuroleptic medicines. It also can be caused by a common gastrointestinal medicine called metoclopramide (Reglan, Gimoti). Tardive dyskinesia causes involuntary movements that occur over and over. Symptoms include grimacing, eye blinking and other movements.
Tourette syndrome.This is a neurological condition associated with repetitive movements and vocal sounds called tics. Tics are voluntary movements, but they're caused by an involuntary urge to make the movements. Tourette syndrome starts between childhood and teenage years.
Tremor.This movement disorder causes rhythmic shaking of parts of the body, such as the hands, head or other body parts. The most common type is essential tremor."
MRSA infection,"Staph skin infections, includingMRSA, generally start as swollen, painful red bumps that might look like pimples or spider bites. The affected area might be:
infections start out as small red bumps that can quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses.
These red bumps can quickly turn into deep, painful boils (abscesses) that require surgical draining. Sometimes the bacteria remain confined to the skin. But they can also burrow deep into the body, causing potentially life-threatening infections in bones, joints, surgical wounds, the bloodstream, heart valves and lungs.

Other symptoms might include:
Belly pain.
Diarrhea.
Fussiness.
Joint pain.
Vomiting.
Some children get a high fever for five or more days but have fewer than four of the symptoms needed for a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. They might have what's called incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of damage to the heart arteries. They still need treatment within 10 days of when symptoms appear.
Kawasaki disease can have symptoms like those of a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The syndrome happens in children with COVID-19."

Muscular dystrophy,"The main symptom of muscular dystrophy is muscle weakness that becomes worse over time. This makes everyday tasks harder to do. The type of muscular dystrophy that a person has determines the:
There are over 30 types of muscular dystrophy. Here are some of the main types along with key symptoms.
This is the most common form. Girls can carry the gene change that causes the disease, and some have symptoms. But this type of muscular dystrophy is much more common in boys.
Most often, the symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy start in early childhood. The symptoms can include challenges with movement, such as:
Other symptoms can include:
The symptoms of this type are like those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but Becker muscular dystrophy tends to be milder, and it becomes worse more slowly. In general, symptoms start in the teens or early adulthood. They might not occur until the mid-20s or later.
Age range at which the symptoms start.
Muscle groups that are affected.
Late walking.
Frequent falls.
Trouble rising from the floor or a lying or seated position.
Trouble running, jumping or climbing stairs.
Waddling gait.
Walking on the toes or the balls of the feet.
Large calf muscles.
Muscle pain and stiffness.
Learning or behavior-related challenges.
Delayed growth.
The symptoms of this type often start by age 10. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy causes certain joints to become stiff. Early on, some children may walk on their toes due to stiff tendons in the heels. They also may have trouble bending the elbows. This type of muscular dystrophy also causes muscles in the shoulders, upper arms and calves to slowly waste and weaken. Some people with the disease develop heart conditions that can cause fainting. Heart conditions need to be watched closely by a healthcare team.
FSHD) With this type, muscle weakness usually starts in the face, shoulders and upper arms. The weakness often affects one side of the body more than the other. When muscles around the eyes are affected, that can cause trouble fully closing the eyelids and lead to dryness of the eye. When the shoulders are affected, the shoulder blades might stick out like wings when the arms are raised. Sometimes, mild hearing loss also may occur. The symptoms of FSHD tend to start in the teenage years.
There are many types of congenital MD. These types cause symptoms at birth or before age 2. Most children with congenital muscular dystrophy have muscle weakness that becomes worse. But some forms of congenital muscular dystrophy progress slowly and cause mild disability. Others become worse quickly and cause serious health challenges. Babies with muscle weakness or lack of muscle tone can seem ""floppy."" Later on, babies and toddlers might take longer than usual to roll over, sit up or walk. Or they might not meet certain milestones of development at all.
This type often affects muscles around the shoulders and hips. Some people with limb-girdle dystrophy develop minor disabilities over time. Others develop serious trouble using their arms or legs to do everyday activities, such as walking or carrying things. The age at which symptoms start, how serious they become and how quickly they get worse varies.
This type tends to weaken the eyelids and the throat muscles. It's also been linked with muscle weakness in the limbs and near the center of the body from top to bottom. It can cause trouble swallowing, weakness of the tongue and drooping eyelids. In time, some people also have trouble with movement. Symptoms often start in the 40s and 50s, and they become worse slowly."

Problems with memory or thinking skills.
Dizziness that worsens with moving from lying down or sitting to standing.
Muscle or joint pain.
Unrefreshing sleep."
Myasthenia gravis,"Muscle weakness caused by myasthenia gravis gets worse when the affected muscle is used. Because symptoms usually get better with rest, muscle weakness can come and go. However, the symptoms tend to progress over time. They usually reach their worst within a few years after the disease begins.
Myasthenia gravis may affect any of the muscles that you can control. Certain muscle groups are more commonly affected than others."

Neurofibromatosis type 1,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) usually is diagnosed during childhood. Symptoms are seen at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Symptoms tend to be mild to moderate, but they can vary from person to person.
Symptoms include:
Freckling in the armpits or groin area.Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds.
Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules.These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.
Bone changes.Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg.
Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma.This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults.
Learning disabilities.It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.
Larger than average head size.Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.
Short stature.Children who have NF1 often are below average in height."

Autonomic neuropathy,"Signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy depend on which nerves are damaged. They might include:
such as difficulty starting urination, loss of bladder control, difficulty sensing a full bladder and inability to completely empty the bladder. Not being able to completely empty the bladder can lead to urinary tract infections.
including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm.
such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heartburn. These problems are all due to changes in digestive function.
low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there.
such as sweating too much or too little. These problems affect the ability to regulate body temperature.
making it difficult to adjust from light to dark and seeing well when driving at night.
which can occur if your heart rate stays the same instead of adjusting to your activity level."
Diabetic neuropathy,"There are four main types of diabetic neuropathy. You can have one type or more than one type of neuropathy.
The symptoms depend on the type of diabetic neuropathy you have and which nerves are affected. Usually, symptoms appear slowly over time. You may not notice anything is wrong until a lot of nerve damage has happened.
This type of neuropathy also may be called distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy. It's the most common type of diabetic neuropathy. It affects the feet and legs first, followed by the hands and arms. Symptoms often are worse at night. They may include:
This type of neuropathy also is called focal neuropathy. It damages a single, specific nerve. That nerve may be in the face, torso, arm or leg. It’s possible for mononeuropathy to affect single nerves in different parts of the body at the same time. Mononeuropathy may lead to:
Loss of feeling, also called numbness, or less ability to feel pain or temperature changes.
A tingling or burning feeling.
Sharp pains or cramps.
Muscle weakness.
Being very sensitive to touch. For some people, even a bedsheet's weight can be painful.
Serious foot problems, such as ulcers, infections, and bone and joint damage.
A lack of the usual warning symptoms that let you know when blood sugar levels are low. This is called hypoglycemia unawareness.
A fast-beating heart while at rest.
Bladder or bowel problems.
Slow stomach emptying, also called gastroparesis. This can cause upset stomach, vomiting, a feeling of fullness and loss of appetite.
Trouble swallowing.

Size.Moles are typically less than 1/4 inch (about 6 mm) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth, known as congenital nevi, can be bigger and cover part of the face, trunk or a limb.
Moles can grow anywhere on your body, including your scalp and armpits, as well as under your nails and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 45 moles. Many of these moles occur by age 40. Moles may change or fade away over time. They may become darker and larger with hormonal changes that occur during the teenage years and while pregnant."

An uncommon condition, stuttering priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism. It occurs more often in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell disease). Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more-frequent and more-prolonged erections. Stuttering priapism may begin in childhood.
Signs and symptoms include:

Parkinson's symptoms may include:
Tremor.This rhythmic shaking usually begins in the hands or fingers. Sometimes tremor begins in the foot or jaw. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest or when you're under stress. You may notice that you shake less when you're doing some sort of task or moving around.
Rigid muscles.You may have stiff muscles in any part of your body. Your muscles may feel tense and painful, and your arm movements may be short and jerky.
Poor posture and balance.Your posture may become stooped. You may fall or have balance problems.
Loss of automatic movements.You may be less able to make certain movements that you typically do without thinking, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk.
Speech changes.You may speak softly or quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be flat or monotone, without typical speech patterns.
Writing changes.You may have trouble writing, and your writing may appear cramped and small."

Most often, these symptoms last about 1 to 3 weeks. Joints that tend to be affected are the hands, wrists, knees, ankles and feet."
Patellar tendinitis,"Pain is the first symptom of patellar tendinitis, usually between your kneecap and where the tendon attaches to your shinbone (tibia).
Initially, you may only feel pain in your knee as you begin physical activity or just after an intense workout. Over time, the pain worsens and starts to interfere with playing your sport. Eventually, the pain interferes with daily movements such as climbing stairs or rising from a chair.
Patellar tendinitis causes pain in the patellar tendon, which runs from the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone (tibia)."

Compulsive gambling,"Signs and symptoms of compulsive gambling (gambling disorder) can include:
Most casual gamblers stop when losing or set a limit on how much they're willing to lose. But people with a compulsive gambling problem are compelled to keep playing to recover their money — a pattern that becomes increasingly destructive over time. Some people may turn to theft or fraud to get gambling money.
Some people with a compulsive gambling problem may have periods of remission — a length of time where they gamble less or not at all. But without treatment, the remission usually isn't permanent.
Being preoccupied with gambling, such as constantly planning gambling activities and how to get more gambling money
Needing to gamble with increasing amounts of money to get the same thrill

You may be able to see the lice, but they're often hard to spot because they're small, avoid light and move quickly.
Nits stick to hair shafts and may be hard to see because they're very tiny. They're easiest to spot around the ears and the hairline of the neck. Empty nits may be easier to spot because they're lighter in color and further from the scalp. However, the presence of nits doesn't mean there are live lice.
Scratching can lead to small, red bumps that may sometimes get infected with bacteria."
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),"The signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease might be mild and difficult to recognize. Some women don't have any signs or symptoms. When signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are present, they most often include:
Pain — ranging from mild to severe — in your lower abdomen and pelvis
Unusual or heavy vaginal discharge that may have an unpleasant odor

Bowel changes, such as not emptying stool all the way or having to put fingers in the vagina to support the bulge to be able to pass stool. This is called splinting.
Weakness of the pelvic floor often affects more than one area. For instance, if one of your pelvic organs is prolapsed, you're more likely to have another type of pelvic organ prolapse."
Chronic pelvic pain,"You may feel chronic pelvic pain in different parts of your pelvic area, rather than in just one spot. You might describe the pain in one or more of the following ways:
Serious and steady.
Pain that comes and goes.

The symptoms of two common types of pemphigus are as follows:
Pemphigus vulgaris.This type usually begins with blisters in the mouth and then on the skin or genital mucous membranes. They're often painful but don't itch. Blisters in the mouth or throat may make it hard to talk, drink and eat.
Pemphigus foliaceus.This type causes blisters on the chest, back and shoulders. The blisters may be itchy or painful. Pemphigus foliaceus doesn't cause mouth blisters.
Pemphigus is distinct from bullous pemphigoid, which is another type of blistering skin condition that affects older adults."

Acute pericarditisbegins suddenly but doesn't last longer than four weeks. Future episodes can occur. It may be hard to tell the difference between acute pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack.
Recurrent pericarditisoccurs about 4 to 6 weeks after a bout of acute pericarditis. No symptoms happen in between.
Incessant pericarditislasts about 4 to 6 weeks but less than three months. The symptoms continue over this whole time.

Perimenopause,"Irregular periods.As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause.
Hot flashes and sleep problems.Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them.
Vaginal and bladder problems.When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence.
Decreasing fertility.As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months.
Loss of bone.With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones.
Changing cholesterol levels.Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the ""bad"" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the ""good"" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease."

Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma.This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults.
Learning disabilities.It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.
Larger than average head size.Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.
Short stature.Children who have NF1 often are below average in height."
Peripheral neuropathy,"Every nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job. Symptoms depend on the type of nerves affected. Nerves are divided into:
Sensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin.
Motor nerves that control muscle movement.
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy might include:
Gradual onset of numbness, prickling, or tingling in your feet or hands. These sensations can spread upward into your legs and arms.

Personality disorders,"In some cases, you may not know that you have a personality disorder. That's because how you think and behave seems natural to you. You also may think others are responsible for your challenges.
There are many types of personality disorders, each with important differences. These disorders are organized into three groups, or clusters, with shared features and symptoms:"
Whooping cough,"Once you become infected with whooping cough, it takes about 5 to 10 days for symptoms to start. Sometimes it takes up to three weeks. The symptoms often are mild at first. They may seem like those of a common cold. They can include:
After a week or two, the symptoms become worse. Thick mucus builds up inside the airways. This causes rapid coughing that can't be controlled. The cough can last for weeks or months, and it may be worse at night. Intense coughing attacks may cause:
People with mild illnesses often don't make the whooping sound. Sometimes, an ongoing hacking cough is the only symptom of whooping cough in teens and adults.

Red, watery eyes.
Fever.
Cough.
Vomiting.

Absence seizure,"A simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds. There's no confusion, headache or drowsiness after the seizure.
Symptoms of absence seizures include:
A sudden stop in activity without falling.
Lip smacking.
Eyelid flutters.
Chewing motions.
Finger rubbing.
Small movements of both hands.
Afterward, there's usually no memory of the incident. But if the seizure is longer, the person may be aware of missed time. Some people have many episodes daily. When it happens, it can interfere with school or daily activities.
A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them. This is because the seizures are so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder. Teachers may say the child has trouble paying attention or that a child is often daydreaming."
Peyronie disease,"Peyronie disease symptoms might start suddenly or appear over time. The most common symptoms include:
Scar tissue.The scar tissue linked with Peyronie disease also is called plaque. It's different from plaque that can build up in blood vessels or on your teeth. It can be felt under the skin of the penis as flat lumps or a band of hard tissue. The area over the scar tissue may feel tender.
A bend to the penis.The penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side.
Erection problems.Peyronie disease might cause problems getting or keeping an erection. This also is called erectile dysfunction. Often though, people with Peyronie disease say they notice erectile dysfunction before the start of their other penile symptoms.
Shortening of the penis.The penis might become shorter during erections due to Peyronie disease.
Pain in the penis.This symptom might happen with or without an erection.
Other changes in how the penis looks.In some people with Peyronie disease, the erect penis might look narrow or indented. It might even take on an hourglass-like shape, with a tight, narrow band around the shaft.
The curving and penile shortening linked with Peyronie disease might become worse over time. Physical changes in the penis often get worse or stay the same during the first year to year and a half.
Pain during erections usually gets better within 1 to 2 years. The scar tissue, penile shortening and curving often remain. It's not common, but the curving and pain of Peyronie disease can get better without treatment."

Hypopituitarism,"The symptoms of hypopituitarism usually start slowly and get worse over time. They might not be noticed for months or even years. But for some people, symptoms start suddenly.
Symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person. Symptoms depend on what hormones are missing and how little of the hormone is being made. There might be more than one hormone that's low.

Signs and symptoms include:
Stuttering priapism — also called recurrent or intermittent priapism — is a form of ischemic priapism. An uncommon condition, stuttering priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism. It occurs more often in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell disease). Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more-frequent and more-prolonged erections. Stuttering priapism may begin in childhood.
Signs and symptoms include:
Rigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis (glans) is soft
Progressively worsening penile pain
Erect but not fully rigid penile shaft
Usually not painful"
Heat rash,"Adults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin. In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin.
Eccrine sweat glands occur over most of the body and open directly onto the skin's surface. Apocrine glands open into the hair follicle, leading to the surface of the skin. Apocrine glands develop in areas with many hair follicles, such as on the scalp, armpits and groin. Eccrine sweat glands are involved in hyperhidrosis, though apocrine glands may play a role as well.
The types of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptoms for each type vary.
The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bumps that break easily.
A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptoms include small, inflamed blister-like bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area.
Occasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa.
A less common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda. It affects the deepest layer of the skin (dermis). It causes firm, painful or itchy inflamed bumps that look like goose bumps and may break open."

They usually appear on the elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. The patches vary in color, depending on skin color. The affected skin might heal with temporary changes in color (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation), particularly on brown or Black skin.
Nail psoriasis.Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe disease may cause the nail to crumble.
Guttate psoriasis.Guttate psoriasis primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling spots on the trunk, arms or legs.
Inverse psoriasis.Inverse psoriasis mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. It causes smooth patches of inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis.

Psoriatic arthritis can affect joints on one or both sides of your body. The signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis often resemble those of rheumatoid arthritis. Both diseases cause joints to become painful, swollen and warm to the touch.
However, psoriatic arthritis is more likely to also cause:
Psoriatic arthritis can cause a painful, sausage-like swelling of your fingers and toes.
Psoriatic arthritis can also cause pain at the points where tendons and ligaments attach to your bones — especially at the back of your heel (Achilles tendinitis) or in the sole of your foot (plantar fasciitis).
Some people develop a condition called spondylitis as a result of psoriatic arthritis. Spondylitis mainly causes inflammation of the joints between the vertebrae of your spine and in the joints between your spine and pelvis (sacroiliitis).
Nails can form tiny dents (pits), crumble or separate from the nail beds.
Uveitis can cause eye pain, redness and blurry vision. If untreated, uveitis can lead to vision loss."

Constant hunger.Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting.
Stomach contractions.Wavelike ripples across your baby's belly may be visible after feeding but before vomiting. This is a sign of the stomach muscles trying to move food out of the stomach.
Dehydration.A baby may show signs of low body fluids, also called dehydration. These signs may include few wet diapers, lack of energy, dry mouth and lips, and crying without tears.
Changes in stool.Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated.
Weight loss.The lack of nutrition can cause a baby not to gain weight or to lose weight."
Pyoderma gangrenosum,"Pyoderma gangrenosum usually starts with a small bump on the skin. It might look like a spider bite. Within days it can turn into a large and painful open sore.

The joint pain associated with reactive arthritis most commonly occurs in the knees, ankles and feet. Pain may also occur in the heels, low back or buttocks.
Many people who have reactive arthritis also develop eye inflammation (conjunctivitis).
This happens most often in the heels and the sole of the feet.
In some cases, toes or fingers might become so swollen that they look like sausages.
Reactive arthritis can affect skin in a variety of ways, including mouth sores and a rash on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands.

Loss of appetite.
Pain in the side or back that doesn't go away.
Tiredness."
Kidney stones,"A kidney stone usually doesn't cause symptoms until it moves around within the kidney or passes into one of the ureters. The ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder.
If a kidney stone gets stuck in one of the ureters, it may block the flow of urine and cause the kidney to swell and the ureter to spasm. That can be very painful. At that point, you may have these symptoms:
Serious, sharp pain in the side and back, below the ribs.

Worsening of symptoms in the evening.Symptoms occur mainly at night.
Nighttime leg twitching.RLSmay be associated with another, more common condition called periodic limb movement of sleep. This condition causes the legs to twitch and kick during sleep, possibly throughout the night.
People typically describeRLSsymptoms as compelling, unpleasant feelings in the legs or feet. They usually happen on both sides of the body. Less commonly, the sensations affect the arms.
The sensations are felt within the leg rather than on the skin. They're described as:
Crawling.
Creeping.
Pulling.
Throbbing.
Aching.
Itching.
Electric.
It's common for symptoms to get better and worse. Sometimes symptoms disappear for periods of time, then come back."

Fluctuating vision
Dark or empty areas in your vision
Vision loss"
Retractile testicle,"Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the final months of development, the testicles gradually descend into the scrotum. If this descent isn't completed at birth, the testicle usually descends within a few months. If your son has a retractile testicle, the testicle originally descended as it should, but doesn't remain in place.
Symptoms of a retractile testicle include:
The testicle may be moved by hand from the groin into the scrotum and won't immediately retreat to the groin.
The testicle might spontaneously appear in the scrotum and remain there for a time.
The testicle might spontaneously disappear again for a time.
Retractile testicle is different from undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). An undescended testicle is one that never entered the scrotum."

Rett syndrome,"The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from child to child.
The main signs and symptoms include:
Other signs and symptoms can include:
Rett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages:
Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than usual head size (microcephaly) is sometimes the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, there is delayed growth in other parts of the body.
The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly, and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or stiff, with unusual movement and positioning.
Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of language. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills.
Children with Rett syndrome usually develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements, which differ from child to child. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing.
Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time.
These include breath holding, rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forcefully blowing out air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours. Other breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or short periods of stopping breathing (apnea) can occur during sleep.
Loss of skills may be connected to losing the ability to think, understand and learn.
Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and progresses with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe.
This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death.
Problems with sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming.
A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as a decreased response to pain; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding.
Signs and symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which starts between 6 and 18 months of age. Stage 1 can last for a few months or a year. Babies in this stage may show less eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delays in sitting or crawling.
Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such as slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or crying for no apparent reason, problems with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication.
The third stage usually begins between the ages of 2 and 10 years, and it can last for many years. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may slightly improve, with less crying and irritability, and there may be some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2.
This stage usually begins after the age of 10 and can last for years or decades. It's marked by reduced mobility, muscle weakness, joint contractures and scoliosis. Understanding, communication and hand skills generally remain stable or improve slightly, and seizures may occur less often."
Reye's syndrome,"In Reye's syndrome, a child's blood sugar usually drops while levels of ammonia and acidity in the blood rise. The liver also may swell, and fats may build up. Swelling may occur in the brain. This can cause seizures, convulsions or loss of consciousness."
Rhabdomyosarcoma,"Signs and symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma depend on where the cancer starts.
Headache.

Trouble with bowel movements.
If the cancer is in the arms or legs, symptoms may include:
Possibly pain in the affected area, if the cancer pushes on nerves or other areas of the body.
Swelling or a lump in the arm or leg."
Rheumatic fever,"Rheumatic fever symptoms usually start about 2 to 4 weeks after a strep throat infection. Symptoms are due to swelling, called inflammation, in the heart, joints, skin or central nervous system. There may be few symptoms or several.

Outbursts of crying or inappropriate laughing."
Rheumatoid arthritis,"Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:
Painful, warm, swollen joints.
Joint stiffness that most often is worse in the mornings and after periods of rest. It can last for 45 minutes or longer.

Rheumatoid arthritis may affect just a few joints at first. Most often, these are the small joints of the hands and the feet.
As the disease gets worse, symptoms may spread to more joints. These most often include the wrists, elbows, hips, knees and ankles. Most of the time, symptoms affect the same joints on both sides of the body.
Many people who have rheumatoid arthritis also have symptoms that affect more than the joints. Areas that may be affected include:
Skin.
Eyes.
Lungs.
Heart.
Nerve tissue.
Blood.
Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms may vary in how bad they are. They may come and go. Periods when the condition becomes more active, called flares, follow periods of less or no swelling and pain. This is called remission.

Rickets,"Symptoms of rickets can include:
In infants, symptoms of rickets may be harder to identify because bone and muscle complaints are often not detected until a child starts to walk. Symptoms of rickets in infants caused by low blood calcium levels may include:
Because rickets softens the areas of growing tissue at the ends of a child's bones, known as growth plates, it can cause skeletal deformities such as:
Delayed growth.

Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems in how people think, feel and behave. Symptoms may include:
Hallucinations.These usually involve seeing or hearing things that other people don't observe. For people with schizophrenia, these things seem real. Hallucinations can occur with any of the senses, but hearing voices is most common.
Disorganized speech and thinking.Disorganized speech causes disorganized thinking. It can be hard for people with schizophrenia to talk with other people. The answers people with schizophrenia give to questions may not be related to what's being asked. Or questions may not be answered fully. Rarely, speech may include putting together unrelated words in a way that can't be understood. Sometimes this is called word salad.
Symptoms can vary in type and how severe they are. At times, symptoms may get better or worse. Some symptoms may be present at all times.
People with schizophrenia usually are diagnosed in the late teen years to early 30s. In men, schizophrenia symptoms usually start in the late teens to early 20s. In women, symptoms usually begin in the late 20s to early 30s. There also is a group of people — usually women — who are diagnosed later in life. It isn't common for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia."

Spinal cord injury,"The ability to control your arms or legs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors. One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord. The other factor is how bad the injury is.
The lowest part of the spinal cord not damaged after an injury is known as the neurological level of the injury. ""The completeness"" of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost. Completeness is classified as:
Complete.If all feeling and all ability to control movement are lost below the spinal cord injury, the injury is called complete.
Incomplete.If some feeling and control of movement remain below the affected area, the injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury.
Loss of feeling and control of movement is known as paralysis. Paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as:
Tetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia.This means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury.
Paraplegia.This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs but not the arms.
Your healthcare team performs a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury.
Spinal cord injuries can cause the following symptoms:
Loss of movement.
Loss of or a change in sensation. This includes a change in the ability to feel heat, cold and touch.
Loss of bowel or bladder control.
Pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in the spinal cord.

A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them. This is because the seizures are so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder. Teachers may say the child has trouble paying attention or that a child is often daydreaming."
Febrile seizure,"Usually, a child having a febrile seizure shakes all over and loses consciousness. Sometimes, the child may get very stiff or twitch in just one area of the body.

Spina bifida,"Symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and from one person to another.
Spina bifida occulta.Typically, there aren't any symptoms of spina bifida occulta because the spinal nerves aren't involved. But you can sometimes see symptoms on the newborn's skin above the small gap in the spine. You might see a tuft of hair, a small dimple or a birthmark. Sometimes, these skin marks can be symptoms of a spinal cord issue that can be found withMRIor a spinal ultrasound in a newborn.
Meningocele.This type may affect bladder and bowel function."
Spinal cord injury,"The ability to control your arms or legs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors. One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord. The other factor is how bad the injury is.
The lowest part of the spinal cord not damaged after an injury is known as the neurological level of the injury. ""The completeness"" of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost. Completeness is classified as:
Complete.If all feeling and all ability to control movement are lost below the spinal cord injury, the injury is called complete.
Incomplete.If some feeling and control of movement remain below the affected area, the injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury.
Loss of feeling and control of movement is known as paralysis. Paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as:
Tetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia.This means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury.
Paraplegia.This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs but not the arms.
Your healthcare team performs a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury.
Spinal cord injuries can cause the following symptoms:
Loss of movement.
Loss of or a change in sensation. This includes a change in the ability to feel heat, cold and touch.
Loss of bowel or bladder control.
Pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in the spinal cord.
Trouble breathing, coughing or clearing secretions from the lungs."
Spinal cord tumor,"Spinal cord tumors may not cause signs and symptoms at first. When symptoms happen, they might start in the part of the spine near the tumor. As a spinal cord tumor grows, it can hurt nearby nerves and cause symptoms in other parts of the body.
In the spine, spinal cord tumor symptoms include:
Pain near the spot where the tumor forms.
Pain that feels worse at night.
Pain that gets worse over time.
A spinal cord tumor that grows to hurt the nearby nerves can cause symptoms that happen along those nerves. Symptoms may include:

Loss of bowel or bladder function.
Muscle weakness in one part of the body.
Trouble with walking, which can lead to falls.

Spinal headaches,"Spinal headache symptoms include:
Dull, throbbing pain that varies in intensity from mild to very severe
Pain that typically gets worse when you sit up or stand and decreases or goes away when you lie down

Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Artificial joints may also be at risk of infection. Signs and symptoms may include:
This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually has large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust.
Cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin. It causes redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too.

Constant hunger.Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting.
Stomach contractions.Wavelike ripples across your baby's belly may be visible after feeding but before vomiting. This is a sign of the stomach muscles trying to move food out of the stomach.
Dehydration.A baby may show signs of low body fluids, also called dehydration. These signs may include few wet diapers, lack of energy, dry mouth and lips, and crying without tears.
Changes in stool.Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated.
Weight loss.The lack of nutrition can cause a baby not to gain weight or to lose weight."
Spinal stenosis,"Spinal stenosis often causes no symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they start slowly and get worse over time. Symptoms depend on which part of the spine is affected."

Viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu),"Although it's commonly called stomach flu, gastroenteritis isn't the same as influenza. The flu (influenza) affects only your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Gastroenteritis, on the other hand, attacks your intestines, causing signs and symptoms such as:
Depending on the cause, viral gastroenteritis symptoms may appear within 1-3 days after you're infected and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms usually last just a day or two, but occasionally they may last up to 14 days.
Because the symptoms are similar, it's easy to confuse viral diarrhea with diarrhea caused by bacteria, such as Clostridioides difficile, salmonella and Escherichia coli, or parasites, such as giardia.
The stomach, small intestine and large intestine (colon) are part of your digestive tract, which processes the foods you eat. Viral gastroenteritis is an inflammation of these organs caused by a virus.
Watery, usually nonbloody diarrhea — bloody diarrhea usually means you have a different, more severe infection
Nausea, vomiting or both

Start as soon as you wake up and last all day.
Come and go.
Whatever pattern of mouth discomfort you have, burning mouth syndrome may last for months to years. In rare cases, symptoms may suddenly go away on their own or happen less often. Sometimes the burning feeling may be briefly relieved during eating or drinking.

Swollen lymph nodes,"The lymph system is a network of organs, vessels and lymph nodes throughout the body. Many lymph nodes are in the head and neck. Lymph nodes there often swell. Swelling can be to the size of a pea or kidney bean or larger.
Swollen lymph nodes are a sign that something is wrong in the body. The nodes might also be tender and painful.
Depending on the cause of the swollen lymph nodes, other symptoms might include:

Tay-Sachs disease,"There are three forms of Tay-Sachs disease: infantile, juvenile and late onset/adult."
Tuberculosis,"When TB germs survive and multiply in the lungs, it is called a TB infection. A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are different in each stage.
Primary TB infection.The first stage is called the primary infection. Immune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may completely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and multiply.
Most people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as:
Latent TB infection.Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent TB infection.
Active TB disease.Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But it usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection.
Symptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks. They may include:
Common sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include:
Active TB disease in children.Symptoms of active TB disease in children vary. Typically, symptoms by age may include the following:

Tenderness
Mild swelling"
Achilles tendinitis,"Achilles tendinitis pain most often begins as a mild ache in the back of the leg or above the heel after running or other sports activity. More-severe burning or aching pain might occur after running a long time, stair climbing or sprinting. Over time, there might be pain even at rest.
Achilles tendinitis can make it hard to use the affected foot. The area also might be tender or stiff, especially in the morning. The soreness usually gets better with mild activity.
Achilles tendinitis is an injury of the Achilles (uh-KILL-eez) tendon often caused by too much use. The Achilles tendon is the band of tissue that joins calf muscles at the back of the lower leg to the heel bone."
Patellar tendinitis,"Pain is the first symptom of patellar tendinitis, usually between your kneecap and where the tendon attaches to your shinbone (tibia).
Initially, you may only feel pain in your knee as you begin physical activity or just after an intense workout. Over time, the pain worsens and starts to interfere with playing your sport. Eventually, the pain interferes with daily movements such as climbing stairs or rising from a chair.
Patellar tendinitis causes pain in the patellar tendon, which runs from the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone (tibia)."

Dull, aching head pain.
Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles.
Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories — episodic and chronic."
Retractile testicle,"Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the final months of development, the testicles gradually descend into the scrotum. If this descent isn't completed at birth, the testicle usually descends within a few months. If your son has a retractile testicle, the testicle originally descended as it should, but doesn't remain in place.
Symptoms of a retractile testicle include:
The testicle may be moved by hand from the groin into the scrotum and won't immediately retreat to the groin.
The testicle might spontaneously appear in the scrotum and remain there for a time.
The testicle might spontaneously disappear again for a time.
Retractile testicle is different from undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). An undescended testicle is one that never entered the scrotum."
Undescended testicle,"Not seeing or feeling a testicle in the scrotum is the main symptom of an undescended testicle.
Testicles form in an unborn baby's lower belly. During the last few months of pregnancy, the testicles typically move down from the stomach area. They move through a tubelike passage in the groin, called the inguinal canal, and descend into the scrotum. With an undescended testicle, that process stops or is delayed."

Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms). Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties.
These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light.
As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include:
Rapid heart rate

This common type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps. It occurs when hair follicles become infected with bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus (staph). Staph bacteria live on the skin all the time. And they can cause problems when they enter the body through a cut or other wound.
This type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps, most often on the back and chest. It's caused by a yeast infection.
This type causes pus-filled bumps around the nose and mouth. It sometimes develops in people who are receiving long-term antibiotic therapy for acne.
This type causes intense itching and recurring patches of bumps and pimples that form near hair follicles of the face and upper body. It mainly affects people with HIV/AIDS. The cause of this condition isn't fully understood.
These occur when hair follicles become deeply infected with staph bacteria. A boil tends to appear suddenly as a painful inflamed bump. A carbuncle is a cluster of boils.
This type affects people who shave."

Young children are particularly susceptible to infection. But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma:
Inflammation — follicular.The early infection has five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva).
Inflammation — intense.In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid.
In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis).The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea).
Corneal clouding (opacity).The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea.
All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid. Without intervention, a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood."

Tuberculosis,"When TB germs survive and multiply in the lungs, it is called a TB infection. A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are different in each stage.
Primary TB infection.The first stage is called the primary infection. Immune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may completely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and multiply.
Most people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as:
Latent TB infection.Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent TB infection.
Active TB disease.Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But it usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection.
Symptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks. They may include:
Common sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include:

Tuberous sclerosis,"Tuberous sclerosis symptoms are caused by noncancerous growths in parts of the body, most commonly in the skin, brain, eyes, kidneys, heart and lungs. But any part of the body can be affected. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the size or location of the growths.
Although symptoms are different for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include:
Skin changes.Skin changes are most common. These include patches of lighter skin and small areas of thickened, smooth or bumpy skin. On the forehead, skin can have raised, discolored areas. Small soft bumps under or around the nails may occur. Growths on the face that start in childhood and look like acne are common.
Seizures.Growths in the brain may be linked with seizures. A seizure is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm involves stiffening of the arms and legs and arching the back and head.
Problems in thinking, reasoning and learning.Tuberous sclerosis can result in developmental delays. Sometimes it limits the ability to think, reason and learn. Mental health conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also can occur.
Behavior problems.Common behavior problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment.
Kidney problems.Growths on the kidneys are common, and more growths may develop with age.
Heart issues.Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as a child gets older.
Eye problems.Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. These growths usually don't interfere with vision.
Dental changes.Teeth may have pits in the surface. Small growths may appear on the gums, inside of the cheeks and on the tongue."

Turner syndrome,"Signs and symptoms of Turner syndrome may vary among girls and women with the disorder. For some girls, the presence of Turner syndrome may not be readily apparent, but in other girls, several physical features are apparent early. Signs and symptoms can be subtle, developing slowly over time, or significant, such as heart defects.
Turner syndrome may be suspected prenatally based on prenatal cell-free DNA screening — a method to screen for certain chromosomal abnormalities in a developing baby using a blood sample from the mother — or prenatal ultrasound. Prenatal ultrasound of a baby with Turner syndrome may show:
Signs of Turner syndrome at birth or during infancy may include:
The most common signs in almost all girls, teenagers and young women with Turner syndrome are short stature and ovarian insufficiency due to ovarian failure.

Pseudobulbar affect,"If you think you have PBA, talk to your doctor. If you have a neurological condition, you might already be treated by a doctor who can diagnose PBA. Helpful specialists include neuropsychologists, neurologists and psychiatrists.
It's suspected that many cases of pseudobulbar affect go unreported and undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness about the condition."
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid),"The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years.

In older adults,UTIs may be overlooked or mistaken for other conditions."
Urine color,"The regular color of urine varies. It depends on how much water you drink. Fluids dilute the yellow pigments in urine. So the more you drink, the clearer your urine looks. When you drink less, the yellow color becomes stronger.
But urine can turn colors far beyond what's typical, including:
Red.
Blue.
Green.
Orange.
Dark brown.
Cloudy white."
Blood in urine (hematuria),"Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red.

Longer or more frequent periods.
Frequent urination or trouble urinating.
Growing stomach area.
Constipation.
Rarely, a fibroid can cause sudden, serious pain when it outgrows its blood supply and starts to die.

In older adults,UTIs may be overlooked or mistaken for other conditions."
Uveitis,"The signs, symptoms and characteristics of uveitis may include:
The uvea is the middle layer of tissue in the wall of the eye. It consists of the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid. When you look at your eye in the mirror, you will see the white part of the eye (sclera) and the colored part of the eye (iris).
The iris is located inside the front of the eye. The ciliary body is a structure behind the iris. The choroid is a layer of blood vessels between the retina and the sclera. The retina lines the inside of the back of the eye, like wallpaper. The inside of the back of the eye is filled with a gel-like liquid called vitreous.
The uvea consists of structures of the eye beneath the white of the eye (sclera). It has three parts: (1) the iris, which is the colored part of the eye; (2) the ciliary body, which is the structure in the eye that secretes the transparent liquid within the front of the eye; and (3) the choroid, which is the layer of blood vessels between the sclera and the retina.
The type of uveitis you have depends on which part or parts of the eye are inflamed:
Eye redness.
Eye pain.
Light sensitivity.
Blurred vision.
Dark, floating spots in your field of vision (floaters).
Decreased vision.
Anterior uveitis affects the inside of the front of your eye (between the cornea and the iris) and the ciliary body. It is also called iritis and is the most common type of uveitis.
Intermediate uveitis affects the retina and blood vessels just behind the lens (pars plana) as well as the gel in the center of the eye (vitreous).
Posterior uveitis affects a layer on the inside of the back of your eye, either the retina or the choroid.
Panuveitis occurs when all layers of the uvea are inflamed, from the front to the back of your eye."
Vaginal agenesis,"Vaginal agenesis often goes unnoticed until females reach their teens, but don't menstruate (amenorrhea). Other signs of puberty usually follow typical female development.
Vaginal agenesis may have these features:
The genitals look like a typical female.
There may be no uterus or one that's only partially developed. If there's tissue lining the uterus (endometrium), monthly cramping or chronic abdominal pain may occur.
The ovaries typically are fully developed and functional, but they may be in an unusual location in the abdomen. Sometimes the pair of tubes that eggs travel through to get from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes) are absent or do not develop typically.
Vaginal agenesis may also be associated with other issues, such as:
Problems with development of the kidneys and urinary tract
Developmental changes in the bones of the spine, ribs and wrists
Hearing problems
Other congenital conditions that also involve the heart, gastrointestinal tract and limb growth"
Vaginal atrophy,"Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) signs and symptoms may include:

Redness and swelling of the vulva. Redness may be harder to see on Black or brown skin than on white skin.
Vaginal pain and soreness.
Thick, white vaginal shedding of fluid and cells, called discharge, with little or no odor. The discharge looks like cottage cheese."
Vaginal fistula,"Vaginal fistula symptoms can include:
Leaking of urine or stool, or passing of gas, through the vagina.
Urinary tract infections that happen often.
Urine that has an unusual odor or contains blood.
Vaginal fluid called discharge that looks or smells unusual.

An infection called trichomoniasis (trik-o-moe-NIE-uh-sis) can cause a greenish-yellow, sometimes frothy discharge."
Valley fever,"Valley fever is the initial form of coccidioidomycosis infection. This initial, acute illness can develop into a more serious disease, including chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis.
If you develop symptoms, especially severe ones, the course of the disease is highly variable. It can take months to fully recover. Fatigue and joint aches can last even longer. The disease's severity depends on several factors, including your overall health and the number of fungus spores you inhale.
If the initial coccidioidomycosis infection doesn't completely resolve, it may progress to a chronic form of pneumonia. This complication is most common in people with weakened immune systems.
Signs and symptoms include:
The most serious form of the disease, disseminated coccidioidomycosis, is uncommon. It occurs when the infection spreads (disseminates) beyond the lungs to other parts of the body. Most often these parts include the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord (meninges).
Signs and symptoms of disseminated disease depend on the body parts affected and may include:
Fever
Cough
Tiredness
Shortness of breath
Headache
Chills
Night sweats
Joint aches and muscle soreness
Red, spotty rash, mainly on lower legs but sometimes on the chest, arms and back
Low-grade fever
Weight loss
Cough

Shortness of breath at rest or when active or lying down.
Fatigue.
Chest pain.
Dizziness.
Swelling of the ankles and feet.
Fainting.
Irregular heartbeat."
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is marked by changes in mental abilities. Symptoms get worse quickly, usually within several weeks to a few months. Early symptoms include:
Death usually occurs within a year. People with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually die of medical issues associated with the disease. They might include having trouble swallowing, falls, heart issues, lung failure, or pneumonia or other infections.
In people with variantCJD, changes in mental abilities may be more apparent in the beginning of the disease. In many cases, dementia develops later in the illness. Symptoms of dementia include the loss of the ability to think, reason and remember.
VariantCJDaffects people at a younger age thanCJD. VariantCJDappears to last 12 to 14 months.
Another rare form of prion disease is called variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr). It can mimic other forms of dementia. It causes changes in mental abilities and problems with speech and thinking. The course of the disease is longer than other prion diseases — about 24 months.
Personality changes.
Memory loss.
Impaired thinking.
Blurry vision or blindness.
Insomnia.
Problems with coordination.
Trouble speaking.
Trouble swallowing.
Sudden, jerky movements."

Raised bumps called papules, which break out over a few days.
Small fluid-filled blisters called vesicles, which form in about one day and then break and leak.
Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take a few more days to heal.
New bumps keep showing up for several days. So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears. And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over.
The disease is by and large mild in healthy children. But sometimes, the rash can cover the whole body. Blisters may form in the throat and eyes. They also may form in tissue that lines the inside of the urethra, anus and vagina."
Esophageal varices,"Esophageal varices usually don't cause symptoms unless they bleed. Symptoms of bleeding esophageal varices include:
Vomiting large amounts of blood.
Black, tarry or bloody stools.
Lightheadedness due to blood loss.
Loss of consciousness in severe cases.
A healthcare professional might suspect esophageal varices if someone has signs of liver disease or has been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, including:
Yellow coloration of your skin and eyes, known as jaundice.
Easy bleeding or bruising.
Fluid buildup in your belly, called ascites (uh-SAHY-teez)."
Varicocele,"A varicocele usually occurs on the left side of the scrotum and often produces no signs or symptoms. Possible signs and symptoms may include:
Pain.A dull, aching pain or discomfort is more likely when standing or late in the day. Lying down often relieves pain.
A mass in the scrotum.If a varicocele is large enough, a mass like a ""bag of worms"" may be visible above the testicle. A smaller varicocele may be too small to see but noticeable by touch.
Differently sized testicles.The affected testicle may be noticeably smaller than the other testicle.
Infertility.A varicocele may lead to difficulty fathering a child, but not all varicoceles cause infertility."
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins might not cause pain. Symptoms of varicose veins include:
Veins that are dark purple, blue or the same color as the skin. Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see.
Veins that look twisted and bulging. They often look like cords on the legs.
When there are painful symptoms of varicose veins, they might include:
An achy or heavy feeling in the legs.
Burning, throbbing, muscle cramping and swelling in the lower legs.
Worse pain after sitting or standing for a long time.
Itching around one or more of the veins.
Changes in skin color around a varicose vein.
Spider veins are like varicose veins, but they're smaller. Spider veins are found closer to the skin's surface and might look like a spider's web.
Spider veins occur on the legs but also can be found on the face. They vary in size and often look like a spider's web."
Smallpox,"After the incubation period, sudden flu-like symptoms occur. These include:
Fever
Muscle aches
Headache
Severe fatigue
Severe back pain
Vomiting, sometimes
A few days later, flat, red spots appear on the body. They may start in the mouth and on the tongue and then spread to the skin. The face, arms and legs are often affected first, followed by the torso, hands and feet.
Within a day or two, many of the spots turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid. Later, the blisters fill with pus. These sores are called pustules. Scabs form 8 to 9 days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars."
Claudication,"The pain may become more severe over time. You may even start to have pain at rest.
Signs or symptoms of peripheral artery disease, usually in more-advanced stages, include:

Less often, pain in shoulders, biceps and forearms
Pain that gets better soon after resting
Cool skin
Severe, constant pain that progresses to numbness
Skin discoloration
Wounds that don't heal"
Vascular dementia,"Vascular dementia symptoms vary, depending on the part of your brain where blood flow is impaired. Symptoms often overlap with those of other types of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease dementia. But unlike Alzheimer's disease, the most significant symptoms of vascular dementia tend to involve speed of thinking and problem-solving rather than memory loss.
Vascular dementia signs and symptoms include:
Vascular dementia symptoms may be most clear-cut when they occur suddenly following a stroke. When changes in your thinking and reasoning seem clearly linked to a stroke, this condition is sometimes called post-stroke dementia.
Sometimes a characteristic pattern of vascular dementia symptoms follows a series of strokes or ministrokes. Changes in your thought processes occur in noticeable steps downward from your previous level of function, unlike the gradual, steady decline that typically occurs in Alzheimer's disease dementia.
But vascular dementia can also develop very gradually, just like Alzheimer's disease dementia. What's more, vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease often occur together.
Studies show that many people with dementia and evidence of brain vascular disease also have Alzheimer's disease.
Confusion
Trouble paying attention and concentrating
Reduced ability to organize thoughts or actions
Decline in ability to analyze a situation, develop an effective plan and communicate that plan to others
Slowed thinking
Difficulty with organization
Problems with memory
Restlessness and agitation
Unsteady gait
Sudden or frequent urge to urinate or inability to control passing urine"
Vascular rings,"Some people with a vascular ring don't have symptoms. Sometimes symptoms aren't noticed until later in life.
Symptoms of a vascular ring may include:
Wheezing.
Coughing, especially coughing that is long-term, also called chronic, or doesn't go away after a cold.
Noisy breathing.
Heartburn.
Frequent respiratory infections.
Trouble swallowing.
Spitting up.
Choking.
Difficulty eating. The person may prefer soft foods, eat slowly and chew thoroughly.
Some people with a vascular ring may be born with other heart conditions. Specific symptoms depend on the types of heart conditions present.
Congenital heart conditions such as vascular rings often are diagnosed before or soon after a child is born. If your baby has symptoms of a heart condition, call your child's healthcare professional. You may be sent to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. Get help right away if your baby has trouble breathing.
Call your baby's healthcare professional if your child has symptoms of a vascular ring, including:
Coughing.
Wheezing.
Noisy breathing.
Difficulty feeding and swallowing."
Vasculitis,"Symptoms of most types of vasculitis can include:
Fever.
Headache.
Tiredness.
Weight loss.
Aches and pains.
Other symptoms depend on the parts of the body affected:
Digestive system.If vasculitis affects the stomach or intestines, there may be pain after eating. Ulcers and tears, called perforations, are possible. They may cause blood in the stool.
Ears.Dizziness, ringing in the ears and sudden hearing loss may happen.
Eyes.Vasculitis can make the eyes look red. They may itch or burn. Giant cell arteritis can cause double vision and brief or ongoing blindness in one or both eyes. This is sometimes the first sign of the disease.
Hands or feet.Some types of vasculitis can cause numbness or weakness in a hand or foot. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet might swell or harden.
Lungs.This can cause shortness of breath or coughing up blood.
Skin.Bleeding under the skin can show up as red spots. Vasculitis also can cause lumps or open sores on the skin."
Nonallergic rhinitis,"Nonallergic rhinitis symptoms often come and go year-round. Your symptoms might include:
Nonallergic rhinitis most often doesn't cause an itchy nose, eyes or throat. That symptom is linked with allergies such as hay fever.
Stuffy or runny nose.
Sneezing.
Mucus in the throat.
Cough."
Vasovagal syncope,"Change in skin color.
Lightheadedness.
Tunnel vision — your field of vision narrows so that you see only what's in front of you.
Upset stomach.
Feeling warm.
A cold, clammy sweat.
Blurred vision.
During a vasovagal syncope episode, people around you may notice:
Jerky movements.
A slow, weak pulse.
Dilated pupils.
Recovery after a vasovagal episode generally begins in less than a minute. However, if you stand up too soon after fainting — within about 15 to 30 minutes — you're at risk of fainting again."
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is marked by changes in mental abilities. Symptoms get worse quickly, usually within several weeks to a few months. Early symptoms include:
Death usually occurs within a year. People with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually die of medical issues associated with the disease. They might include having trouble swallowing, falls, heart issues, lung failure, or pneumonia or other infections.
In people with variantCJD, changes in mental abilities may be more apparent in the beginning of the disease. In many cases, dementia develops later in the illness. Symptoms of dementia include the loss of the ability to think, reason and remember.
VariantCJDaffects people at a younger age thanCJD. VariantCJDappears to last 12 to 14 months.
Another rare form of prion disease is called variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr). It can mimic other forms of dementia. It causes changes in mental abilities and problems with speech and thinking. The course of the disease is longer than other prion diseases — about 24 months.

Sudden, jerky movements."
DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome),"Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome can vary based on what body systems are affected and the severity of the problems. Some symptoms may be clear at birth, but others may not appear until later in infancy or as a young child, or as an adult.
Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome may include:
Heart issues, such as problems with the structure of the heart and vessels, or a heart murmur and bluish skin because of poor circulation of blood, also known as cyanosis.
Frequent infections.
Distinctive facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, ears that look different, wide-set eyes, hooded eyes and an enlarged nose tip. Asymmetric crying facies also may be present. This is when muscles on one side of the mouth don't develop fully, causing that side of the mouth to droop when crying, though the face looks balanced at rest.
A gap in the roof of the mouth, also known as a cleft palate, or other problems with the palate.
A hard time feeding, failure to gain weight or stomach problems.
Hearing loss.
Poor muscle tone.
Kidney problems.
Poor vision and other eye problems.
Low levels of calcium in the blood.
Scoliosis.
Other symptoms may include:
Delayed growth.
Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones.
Delayed speech development or nasal-sounding speech.
Learning delays or disabilities.
Behavioral problems.
Other conditions may cause symptoms like 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It's important to get the right diagnosis quickly if your child shows any symptoms listed above.
Healthcare professionals may suspect 22q11.2 deletion syndrome:
At birth.If a severe heart problem, cleft palate or other signs typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are clear at birth, tests likely will be done before your child leaves the hospital.
At well-baby visits.Illnesses or conditions that are typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may become clear over time. Your child's healthcare professional may see issues during regularly scheduled well-baby visits or annual checkups."

Viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu),"Although it's commonly called stomach flu, gastroenteritis isn't the same as influenza. The flu (influenza) affects only your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Gastroenteritis, on the other hand, attacks your intestines, causing signs and symptoms such as:
Depending on the cause, viral gastroenteritis symptoms may appear within 1-3 days after you're infected and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms usually last just a day or two, but occasionally they may last up to 14 days.
Because the symptoms are similar, it's easy to confuse viral diarrhea with diarrhea caused by bacteria, such as Clostridioides difficile, salmonella and Escherichia coli, or parasites, such as giardia.
The stomach, small intestine and large intestine (colon) are part of your digestive tract, which processes the foods you eat. Viral gastroenteritis is an inflammation of these organs caused by a virus.
Watery, usually nonbloody diarrhea — bloody diarrhea usually means you have a different, more severe infection
Nausea, vomiting or both
Stomach cramps and pain
Occasional muscle aches or headache
Low-grade fever"

It's difficult to predict how this disease will progress. Sometimes the patches stop forming without treatment. In most cases, pigment loss spreads and eventually involves most of the skin. Occasionally, the skin gets its color back.
Patchy loss of skin color, which usually first appears on the hands, face, and areas around body openings and the genitals
Premature whitening or graying of the hair on your scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows or beard
Loss of color in the tissues that line the inside of the mouth and nose (mucous membranes)
With this type, called universal vitiligo, the discoloration affects nearly all skin surfaces.
With this most common type, called generalized vitiligo, the discolored patches often progress similarly on corresponding body parts (symmetrically).
This type, called segmental vitiligo, tends to occur at a younger age, progress for a year or two, then stop.
This type is called localized (focal) vitiligo.
With this type, called acrofacial vitiligo, the affected skin is on the face and hands, and around body openings, such as the eyes, nose and ears."

Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules.These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.
Bone changes.Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg.
Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma.This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults.
