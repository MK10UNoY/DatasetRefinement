Lead poisoning,"There are many possible symptoms of lead poisoning. Lead can affect many different parts of the body. A single high dose of lead can cause severe emergency symptoms.; However, it is more common for lead poisoning to occur slowly over time. This results from repeated exposure to small amounts of lead. In this case, there may not be any obvious symptoms. Over time, even low levels of lead exposure can harm a child's mental development. The health problems get worse as the level of lead in the blood gets higher.; Lead is much more harmful to children than adults because it can affect children's developing nerves and brains. The younger the child, the more harmful lead can be. Unborn children are the most vulnerable.; Possible complications include:; The symptoms of lead poisoning may include:; Very high levels of lead may cause vomiting, internal bleeding, staggering walk, muscle weakness, seizures, or coma.; Behavior or attention problems; Failure at school; Hearing problems; Kidney damage; Reduced IQ; Slowed body growth; Abdominal pain and cramping (usually the first sign of a high, toxic dose of lead); Aggressive behavior; Anemia (low red blood cell count); Constipation; Difficulty getting pregnant; Difficulty sleeping; Headaches; Hearing loss; Irritability; Loss of previous developmental skills (in young children); Low appetite and energy; Reduced sensations"
Mercuric chloride poisoning,"Symptoms of mercuric chloride poisoning include:; Abdominal pain (severe); Breathing difficulty (severe); Decreased urine output (may stop completely); Diarrhea (bloody); Drooling; Metallic taste; Mouth lesions (sores); Pain in the throat and mouth (severe); Shock (extremely low blood pressure); Swelling in the throat (may result in throat closure and inability to breathe); Vomiting, including blood"
Mercuric oxide poisoning,"Symptoms of mercuric oxide poisoning include:; Abdominal pain (severe); Breathing difficulty (severe); Bloody diarrhea; Decreased urine output (may stop completely); Drooling; Metallic taste in the mouth; Mouth soresÂ (ulcers); Throat swelling (swelling may cause throat to close); Shock (extremely low blood pressure); Vomiting, including blood"
Mercury poisoning,"ELEMENTAL MERCURY; Elemental mercury is usually harmless if it is touched or swallowed. It is so thick and slippery that it usually falls off the skin or leaves the stomach and intestines without being absorbed.; A lot of damage can occur, though, if elemental mercury gets into the air in the form of small droplets that are breathed into the lungs. This often occurs by mistake when people try to vacuum up mercury that has spilled onto the ground.; Breathing in enough elemental mercury will cause symptoms right away. These are called acute symptoms. Long-term symptoms will occur if small amounts are inhaled over time. These are called chronic symptoms. Chronic symptoms may include:; Depending on how much mercury is inhaled, permanent lung damage and death may occur. Long-term brain damage from inhaled elemental mercury can also occur.; There have been cases of mercury being injected under the skin, which can cause fever and rash. Infection may develop, requiring surgical drainage and removal of the mercury.; INORGANIC MERCURY; Unlike elemental mercury, inorganic mercury is usually poisonous when swallowed. Depending on how much is swallowed, symptoms may include:; If inorganic mercury enters your bloodstream, it can attack the kidneys and brain. Permanent kidney damage and kidney failure may occur. A large amount in the bloodstream may cause massive blood and fluid loss from diarrhea and kidney failure, leading to death.; ORGANIC MERCURY; Organic mercury can cause sickness if it is breathed in, eaten, or placed on the skin over long periods of time. Usually, organic mercury causes problems over years or decades, not right away. This means that being exposed to small amounts of organic mercury every day for years will likely cause symptoms to appear later. A single large exposure, however, can also cause problems.; Long-term exposure will likely cause symptoms in the nervous system, including:; Being exposed to large amounts of the organic mercury called methylmercury while pregnant may cause permanent brain damage in the baby. Most health care providers recommend eating less fish, especially high-mercury fish such as swordfish, while pregnant, and limiting the consumption of such fish by small children as well. Women should talk to their provider about what they should and should not eat while pregnant.; Metallic taste in the mouth; Vomiting; Difficulty breathing; Bad cough; Swollen, bleeding gums; Burning in the stomach and throat; Bloody diarrhea and vomiting; Numbness or pain in certain parts of your skin; Uncontrollable shaking or tremor; Inability to walk well; Blindness and double vision; Memory problems; Seizures and death (with large exposures)"

Atypical genitalia,"Your medical team will likely be the first to notice atypical genitalia soon after your baby is born. Sometimes, atypical genitalia may be suspected before birth. Atypical genitalia can vary in appearance. Differences may depend on when during genital development the hormone changes that affected development occurred and the cause.
An enlarged clitoris, which may look like a penis.
Closed labia, or labia that include folds and look like a scrotum.
Lumps that feel like testicles in the fused labia.

Amnesia,"The two main features of amnesia are:
Trouble learning new information.
Trouble remembering past events and previously familiar information.
Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. Recent memories are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared.
Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder.
Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills."
Transient global amnesia,"The main symptom of transient global amnesia is being unable to create new memories and remember the recent past. Once that symptom is confirmed, ruling out other possible causes of amnesia is important.
You must have these signs and symptoms to be diagnosed with transient global amnesia:
More symptoms and history that may help diagnose transient global amnesia:
Sudden onset of confusion that includes memory loss, seen by a witness
Being awake and alert and knowing who you are, despite memory loss
Normal cognition, such as the ability to recognize and name familiar objects and follow simple directions

Some people with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes.
Sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood circulation in the hands and feet, which can cause them to swell.
The spleen is important for protecting against infections. Sickle cells can damage the spleen, raising the risk of developing infections. Babies and children with sickle cell anemia commonly receive vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia.
Tiny blood vessels that supply blood to the eyes can become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images, called the retina, and lead to vision problems."

Some people develop a red rash with a lacy, net-like pattern.
Chronic headaches, including migraines; dementia and seizures are possible when a blood clot blocks blood flow to parts of the brain.
Antiphospholipid syndrome can damage heart valves.

Bird flu may cause breathing problems more often than other kinds of flu. And during bird flu pandemics, the risk that a person with flu will need a machine to help them breathe is higher."
Baby acne,"Baby acne is small, inflamed bumps on a baby's face, neck, back or chest. It often develops within 2 to 4 weeks of birth.
Many babies also develop tiny, pimple-like bumps on the face. These harmless spots are called milia. They disappear on their own within a few weeks.
Another condition that might be mistaken for baby acne is benign cephalic pustulosis (BCP), also called neonatal cephalic pustulosis. A bad reaction to yeast on the skin causes BCP.
None of these conditions is caused by the type of bacterium that causes acne in teens and adults."

You feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things.
You don't want to waste anything.
Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections.

Dural arteriovenous fistulas,"Some people with dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) may not have symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may be characterized as benign or aggressive. An aggressivedAVFhas more-serious symptoms.
AggressivedAVFsymptomscan result from bleeding in the brain, known as intracerebral hemorrhage. Bleeding in the brain often causes a sudden headache. It also may cause other symptoms based on the location and size of the hemorrhage.
Aggressive symptoms also may result from nonhemorrhagic neurological deficits (NHNDs), which can include seizures or changes in mental abilities. These symptoms usually develop more gradually, over days to weeks. Symptoms are typically related to the area of the brain affected.

Begin in a single area, such as your leg, neck or arm. Focal dystonia that begins after age 21 usually starts in the neck, arm or face. Although it tends to remain in the single area, it may spread to a neighboring area of the body.
Occur during a specific action, such as writing by hand.
Become more noticeable over time.
Areas of the body that can be affected include:
Neck.When the neck muscles are involved, it's called cervical dystonia. Contractions cause the head to twist and turn to one side. Or the head may pull forward or backward. Cervical dystonia sometimes causes pain.
Eyelids.When muscles controlling eye blinks are involved, it's called blepharospasm. Rapid blinking or muscle spasms that cause your eyes to close make it hard to see.

Heat rash,"Adults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin. In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin.
Eccrine sweat glands occur over most of the body and open directly onto the skin's surface. Apocrine glands open into the hair follicle, leading to the surface of the skin. Apocrine glands develop in areas with many hair follicles, such as on the scalp, armpits and groin. Eccrine sweat glands are involved in hyperhidrosis, though apocrine glands may play a role as well.
The types of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptoms for each type vary.
The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bumps that break easily.
A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptoms include small, inflamed blister-like bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area.
Occasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa.
A less common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda. It affects the deepest layer of the skin (dermis). It causes firm, painful or itchy inflamed bumps that look like goose bumps and may break open."

Sometimes, hemifacial spasms occur on both sides of the face. However, the twitching doesn't occur on both sides of the face at the same time."
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),"The symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome vary, depending on the cause. The first symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E. coli bacteria might include:
Diarrhea, which is often bloody.

All forms of hemolytic uremic syndrome damage blood vessels. This damage causes red blood cells to break down, called anemia. The condition also causes blood clots to form in the blood vessels and, in turn, damage the kidneys.
Symptoms of these changes include:
Loss of color in the skin.
Easy bruising.

Stuttering priapism — also called recurrent or intermittent priapism — is a form of ischemic priapism. An uncommon condition, stuttering priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism. It occurs more often in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell disease). Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more-frequent and more-prolonged erections. Stuttering priapism may begin in childhood.

HPV infection,"Usually, the body's immune system defeats an HPV infection before it creates warts. Different types of HPV produce different warts, including:
In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain. But they might itch or feel tender.
Common warts can grow on hands or fingers. They're small, grainy bumps that are rough to the touch. They're usually flesh-colored, white, pink or tan.
Plantar warts are caused by the same type of virus that causes warts on the hands and fingers. But, because of where they are, they can be painful.
Flat warts are smaller and smoother than other warts. They generally occur on the face or legs. They're more common in children and teens than in adults.
HPV infections cause almost all cervical cancers. But cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an HPV infection. The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don't cause symptoms. Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is the best way to protect against cervical cancer.
Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to keep having Pap tests every three years. Or the Pap test can be every five years for women who also get an HPV DNA test at the same time. Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three regular Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no irregular results.
Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps. They usually occur on the hands and fingers. Most common warts are simply not attractive. But they also can be painful. And it's easy for them to get injured or bleed.
Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of the feet. These warts might cause discomfort.
Flat warts are flat-topped, slightly raised sores called lesions. They can appear anywhere on the body. But children usually get them on the face, men tend to get them in the beard area, and women tend to get them on the legs."

Dystonia may affect the entire body or one part of the body.The most common type of dystonia in adults is cervical dystonia. In cervical dystonia, the neck muscles contract involuntarily. This causes the head to pull to one side or to tilt forward or backward. The head also may shake, known as a tremor.
Functional movement disorder.This condition may look like any of the movement disorders. But it's not caused by a disease of the nervous system, also known as a neurological disease. Functional movement disorders are treatable.

Progressive supranuclear palsy.This is a rare nervous system condition that causes problems with walking, balance and eye movements. It may resemble Parkinson's disease but is a distinct condition.
Tardive dyskinesia.This neurological condition is caused by long-term use of certain medicines used to treat mental health conditions, called neuroleptic medicines. It also can be caused by a common gastrointestinal medicine called metoclopramide (Reglan, Gimoti). Tardive dyskinesia causes involuntary movements that occur over and over. Symptoms include grimacing, eye blinking and other movements.
Tourette syndrome.This is a neurological condition associated with repetitive movements and vocal sounds called tics. Tics are voluntary movements, but they're caused by an involuntary urge to make the movements. Tourette syndrome starts between childhood and teenage years.

ODDcan be mild, moderate or severe:
Mild.Symptoms occur only in one setting, such as only at home, school, work or with peers.
Moderate.Some symptoms occur in at least two settings.
Severe.Some symptoms occur in three or more settings.
For some children, symptoms may first be seen only at home. But with time, problem behavior also may happen in other settings, such as school, social activities and with friends."
Oligodendroglioma,"Signs and symptoms of oligodendroglioma include:
Balance problems.
Changes in behavior.
Memory problems.
Numbness on one side of the body.
Problems speaking.
Problems thinking clearly.
Seizures."
Orthostatic hypotension (postural hypotension),"The most common symptom of orthostatic hypotension is lightheadedness or dizziness when standing after sitting or lying down. Symptoms usually last less than a few minutes.
Orthostatic hypotension signs and symptoms include:
Lightheadedness or dizziness upon standing
Blurry vision
Weakness
Fainting (syncope)
Confusion"
Osteochondritis dissecans,"Depending on the joint that's affected, signs and symptoms of osteochondritis dissecans might include:
Pain.This most common symptom of osteochondritis dissecans might be triggered by physical activity — walking up stairs, climbing a hill or playing sports.
Swelling and tenderness.The skin around your joint might be swollen and tender.
Joint popping or locking.Your joint might pop or stick in one position if a loose fragment gets caught between bones during movement.
Joint weakness.You might feel as though your joint is ""giving way"" or weakening.
Decreased range of motion.You might be unable to straighten the affected limb completely."
Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum,"Symptoms of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, also called PA/IVS, may appear soon after birth. They can include:
Blue or gray skin. Changes may be harder or easier to see depending on the baby's skin color.
Fast breathing or shortness of breath.
Tiredness.
Poor feeding.
Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, also called PA/IVS, is often found during pregnancy or soon after birth. If your baby has symptoms of PA/IVS after you've left the hospital, call a healthcare professional right away."
Peripheral artery disease (PAD),"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) may not cause symptoms, or symptoms may be mild. PAD symptoms include:
Leg pain when walking.
Muscle pain or cramping in the arms or legs, often in the calf.
Painful cramping in one or both of the hips, thighs or calves after walking or climbing stairs or other activities.
Pain when using the arms, such as aching and cramping when knitting or writing.
Coldness in the lower leg or foot, especially when compared with the other side.
Leg numbness or weakness.
No pulse or a weak pulse in the legs or feet.
The muscle pain in peripheral artery disease may:
Wake you up from sleep.
Occur during rest or when lying down if the condition is severe.
Other symptoms of PAD may include:
Shiny skin on the legs.
Skin color changes on the legs.
Slow-growing toenails.
Sores on the toes, feet or legs that won't heal.
Hair loss or slower hair growth on the legs.
Erectile dysfunction."
Popliteal artery entrapment,"Tingling or burning in your calf.
Numbness in the calf area.
If the nearby vein, called the popliteal vein, also becomes trapped by the calf muscle, you may have:
A heavy feeling in the leg.
Lower leg cramping at night.
Swelling in the calf area.
Changes in skin color around the calf muscle.
Blood clot in the lower leg, called deep vein thrombosis.
Symptoms typically affect young, otherwise healthy people under age 40."
Paget's disease of bone,"Most people who have Paget's disease of bone have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, the most common complaint is bone pain.
Because this disease causes your body to generate new bone faster than normal, the rapid remodeling produces bone that's less organized and weaker than normal bone, which can lead to bone pain, deformities and fractures.
The disease might affect only one or two areas of your body or might be widespread. Your signs and symptoms, if any, will depend on the affected part of your body.
Paget's disease of bone in the pelvis can cause hip pain.
An overgrowth of bone in the skull can cause hearing loss or headaches."
Paget's disease of the breast,"Paget's disease of the breast affects your nipple and usually the skin (areola) surrounding it. It's easy to mistake the signs and symptoms of Paget's disease of the breast for skin irritation (dermatitis) or another noncancerous (benign) skin condition.
Possible signs and symptoms of Paget's disease of the breast include:
Breast and nipple changes can be a sign of breast cancer. Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice anything unusual.
Signs and symptoms usually occur in one breast only. The disease typically starts in the nipple and may spread to the areola and other areas of the breast.
The skin changes may come and go early on or respond to topical treatment, making it appear as if your skin is healing. On average, signs and symptoms occur for several months before a diagnosis is made.
Flaky or scaly skin on your nipple
Crusty, oozing or hardened skin resembling eczema on the nipple, areola or both
Itching
Redness
A tingling or burning sensation
Straw-colored or bloody nipple discharge
A flattened or turned-in (inverted) nipple
A lump in the breast
Thickening skin on the breast"
Panic attacks and panic disorder,"Panic attacks typically begin suddenly, without warning. They can strike at any time — when you're driving a car, at the mall, sound asleep or in the middle of a business meeting. You may have occasional panic attacks, or they may occur frequently.
Panic attacks have many variations, but symptoms usually peak within minutes. You may feel fatigued and worn out after a panic attack subsides.
Panic attacks typically include some of these signs or symptoms:
Sense of impending doom or danger
Fear of loss of control or death
Rapid, pounding heart rate
Sweating
Trembling or shaking
Shortness of breath or tightness in your throat
Chills
Hot flashes
Nausea
Abdominal cramping
Chest pain
Headache
Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness
Numbness or tingling sensation
Feeling of unreality or detachment
One of the worst things about panic attacks is the intense fear that you'll have another one. You may fear having panic attacks so much that you avoid certain situations where they may occur."
Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return,"Symptoms of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) can include trouble breathing or fatigue. Sometimes, there are no noticeable symptoms.
Serious congenital heart defects are often diagnosed before or soon after a child is born. If you think that your baby has symptoms of a heart condition, call your child's healthcare professional.
Call your baby's healthcare professional if the baby has trouble breathing or other symptoms ofPAPVR."
Paraganglioma,"Paraganglioma symptoms may depend on where the tumor starts. Paragangliomas most often start in the head, neck, stomach area or pelvis.
Symptoms of a paraganglioma in the head or neck can include:
A rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound in the ears, called pulsatile tinnitus.
Trouble swallowing.
Hoarse voice.
Hearing loss.
Blurred vision.
Dizziness.
When paragangliomas form in other places in the body, the symptoms are more likely to be caused by hormones that the paraganglioma makes. The hormones, called catecholamines, play a role in how the body response to stress. They include adrenaline, also known as the fight-or-flight hormone.
Symptoms of paragangliomas that make hormones include:
Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart.
The sudden loss of color in the face.
Sweating.
Headache.
Uncontrolled shaking in the hands or arms.
General weakness.
These symptoms may come and go.
Some people with paragangliomas don't have any symptoms. They may learn they have these tumors when imaging tests done for other reasons happen to spot the tumors."
Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease symptoms can be different for everyone. Early symptoms may be mild, and you may not even notice them. Symptoms often begin on one side of the body, then affect both sides. Symptoms are usually worse on one side than the other. Some Parkinson's disease symptoms are similar to those of other disorders.
Parkinson's symptoms may include:
Tremor.This rhythmic shaking usually begins in the hands or fingers. Sometimes tremor begins in the foot or jaw. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest or when you're under stress. You may notice that you shake less when you're doing some sort of task or moving around.
Rigid muscles.You may have stiff muscles in any part of your body. Your muscles may feel tense and painful, and your arm movements may be short and jerky.
Poor posture and balance.Your posture may become stooped. You may fall or have balance problems.
Loss of automatic movements.You may be less able to make certain movements that you typically do without thinking, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk.
Speech changes.You may speak softly or quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be flat or monotone, without typical speech patterns.
Writing changes.You may have trouble writing, and your writing may appear cramped and small."
Parotid tumors,"Signs and symptoms of parotid tumors include:
A lump or swelling on one side of the face that might appear near the ear or cheek.
Trouble swallowing.
Trouble opening the mouth widely.
Numbness in part of the face.
Muscle weakness in part of the face.
Pain in the face."
Patellofemoral pain syndrome,"Patellofemoral pain syndrome usually causes a dull, aching pain in the front of the knee. The following can increase the pain:
Walking up or down stairs.
Kneeling or squatting.
Sitting with a bent knee for long periods of time."
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),"Patent ductus arteriosus symptoms (PDA) depend on the size of the opening and the person's age. A smallPDAmight not cause symptoms. Some people don't notice symptoms until adulthood. A largePDAcan cause symptoms of heart failure soon after birth.
A largePDAfound during infancy or childhood might cause:
Poor eating, which leads to poor growth.
Sweating with crying or eating.
Constant fast breathing or being out of breath.
Easy tiring.
Rapid heart rate."
Pseudobulbar affect,"If you think you have PBA, talk to your doctor. If you have a neurological condition, you might already be treated by a doctor who can diagnose PBA. Helpful specialists include neuropsychologists, neurologists and psychiatrists.
It's suspected that many cases of pseudobulbar affect go unreported and undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness about the condition."
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),"Symptoms ofPCOSoften start around the time of the first menstrual period. Sometimes symptoms develop later after you have had periods for a while.
The symptoms ofPCOSvary. A diagnosis ofPCOSis made when you have at least two of these:
Polycystic ovaries.Your ovaries might be bigger. Many follicles containing immature eggs may develop around the edge of the ovary. The ovaries might not work the way they should.
PCOSsigns and symptoms are typically more severe in people with obesity."
Pediatric white blood cell disorders,"Symptoms depend on the type of white blood cell and whether there are too few or too many of them. Symptoms might be those of infections, conditions in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues, called autoimmune conditions, allergies and certain cancers."
Pelvic organ prolapse,"Sometimes, pelvic organ prolapse has no symptoms. When symptoms happen, they might include:
Seeing or feeling a bulge of tissue at or beyond the opening of the vagina.
Lower back pain.
Not being able to keep in a tampon.
Urinary changes. These might include urinating more, feeling an urgent need to urinate, not being able to empty the bladder all the way or having a weak urine stream.
Bowel changes, such as not emptying stool all the way or having to put fingers in the vagina to support the bulge to be able to pass stool. This is called splinting.
Weakness of the pelvic floor often affects more than one area. For instance, if one of your pelvic organs is prolapsed, you're more likely to have another type of pelvic organ prolapse."
Pemphigus,"Pemphigus causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. The blisters break easily, leaving open sores. The sores may become infected and ooze.
The symptoms of two common types of pemphigus are as follows:
Pemphigus vulgaris.This type usually begins with blisters in the mouth and then on the skin or genital mucous membranes. They're often painful but don't itch. Blisters in the mouth or throat may make it hard to talk, drink and eat.
Pemphigus foliaceus.This type causes blisters on the chest, back and shoulders. The blisters may be itchy or painful. Pemphigus foliaceus doesn't cause mouth blisters.
Pemphigus is distinct from bullous pemphigoid, which is another type of blistering skin condition that affects older adults."
Perimenopause,"Irregular periods.As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause.
Hot flashes and sleep problems.Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them.
Vaginal and bladder problems.When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence.
Decreasing fertility.As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months.
Loss of bone.With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones.
Changing cholesterol levels.Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the ""bad"" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the ""good"" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease."
Peripheral nerve injuries,"With a peripheral nerve injury, symptoms may range from mild to serious, limiting your daily activities. Your symptoms often depend on which nerve fibers are damaged:
Motor nerves.These nerves regulate all the muscles under your conscious control, such as those used for walking, talking and holding objects. Damage to these nerves can cause muscle weakness, painful cramps and muscle twitching."
Peripheral nerve tumors,"Symptoms of peripheral nerve tumors vary depending on where the tumors are located and the tissues affected. They include:
Swelling or a lump under the skin.
Pain, tingling or numbness.
Weakness or a loss of function in the affected area.
Dizziness or a loss of balance."
Persistent post-concussive symptoms (Post-concussion syndrome),"Persistent post-concussive symptoms can be different in each person. They may include:
Headaches.
Dizziness.
Fatigue.
Irritability.
Trouble falling asleep or sleeping too much.
Poor concentration and memory.
Ringing in the ears.
Blurry vision.
Noise and light sensitivity.
Nausea or vomiting.
Neck pain.
Headaches after a concussion most often feel like migraines. The headaches also might feel like tension-type headaches, which may be related to a neck injury that happened at the same time as the head injury."
Whooping cough,"Once you become infected with whooping cough, it takes about 5 to 10 days for symptoms to start. Sometimes it takes up to three weeks. The symptoms often are mild at first. They may seem like those of a common cold. They can include:
After a week or two, the symptoms become worse. Thick mucus builds up inside the airways. This causes rapid coughing that can't be controlled. The cough can last for weeks or months, and it may be worse at night. Intense coughing attacks may cause:
People with mild illnesses often don't make the whooping sound. Sometimes, an ongoing hacking cough is the only symptom of whooping cough in teens and adults.
Many babies with the illness don't cough at all. Some babies and young children might.
Runny or stuffy nose.
Red, watery eyes.
Fever.
Cough.
Vomiting.
A red or blue face.
Gag or struggle to breathe.
Have skin, lips or nails that turn blue or purple.
Have life-threatening pauses in breathing called apnea."

Headache."
Phenylketonuria (PKU),"Newborns withPKUinitially don't have any symptoms. However, without treatment, babies usually develop signs ofPKUwithin a few months.
Signs and symptoms of untreatedPKUcan be mild or severe and may include:
A musty odor in the breath, skin or urine, caused by too much phenylalanine in the body
Nervous system (neurological) problems that may include seizures
Skin rashes, such as eczema
Lighter skin, hair and eye color than family members, because phenylalanine can't transform into melanin — the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone
Unusually small head size (microcephaly)
Hyperactivity
Intellectual disability
Delayed development
Behavioral, emotional and social problems
Mental health disorders"
Sacral dimple,A sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back. It's usually located just above the crease between the buttocks.

Numbness or less feeling in the area supplied by the nerve.
Sharp, aching or burning pain, which may radiate outward.
Tingling, or a pins and needles feeling.
Muscle weakness in the affected area.

Symptoms related to a pinched nerve may be worse when you're sleeping."
Pinworm infection,"Symptoms of pinworm infection may include:
Pinworms often cause no symptoms.
Itching of the anal or vaginal area
Insomnia, irritability, teeth grinding and restlessness
Occasional stomach pain and nausea"
Pituitary tumors,"Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Sometimes these tumors are found during an imaging test, such as anMRIor aCTscan, that is done for another reason. If they don't cause symptoms, pituitary tumors usually don't need treatment."
Placenta accreta,"Placenta accreta often causes no signs or symptoms during pregnancy — although vaginal bleeding during the third trimester might occur.
Occasionally, placenta accreta is detected during a routine ultrasound."
Placental abruption,"Placental abruption is most likely to occur in the last trimester of pregnancy, especially in the last few weeks before birth. Signs and symptoms of placental abruption include:
Abdominal pain and back pain often begin suddenly. The amount of vaginal bleeding can vary greatly, and doesn't necessarily indicate how much of the placenta has separated from the uterus. It's possible for the blood to become trapped inside the uterus, so even with a severe placental abruption, there might be no visible bleeding.
Vaginal bleeding, although there might not be any
Abdominal pain
Back pain
Uterine tenderness or rigidity
Uterine contractions, often coming one right after another"
Plantar warts,"Plantar wart signs and symptoms include:
A small, rough growth on the bottom of your foot, usually at the base of the toes or on the ball or heel
On brown and Black skin, the growth may be lighter than unaffected skin
Hard, thickened skin (callus) over a spot on the skin, where a wart has grown inward
Black pinpoints, which are small clotted blood vessels commonly called wart seeds
A cluster of growths on the sole of the foot (mosaic warts)
A growth that interrupts the normal lines and ridges in the skin of your foot
Pain or tenderness when walking or standing"
Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS),"Symptoms of primary lateral sclerosis usually take years to develop and get worse. Symptoms generally begin in the legs. Rarely,PLSbegins with weakness in the tongue or hands. Then weakness gradually moves down the spinal cord to the legs. However, symptoms vary from person to person. Symptoms may include:
Stiffness, weakness and muscle spasms in the legs. This is known as spasticity. Rarely, spasticity starts in only one leg and moves to the arms, hands, tongue and jaw.
Slowed movement.
Tripping, being clumsy and having trouble with balance.
Hand clumsiness.
A hoarse voice, as well as slowed, slurred speech and drooling.
Trouble chewing and swallowing.
Sometimes, frequent, rapid and intense shifts in emotions.
Rarely, breathing problems and bladder problems late in the disease."
Pneumonia,"The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer.
Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:
Chest pain when you breathe or cough
Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)
Cough, which may produce phlegm
Fatigue
Fever, sweating and shaking chills
Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
Shortness of breath
Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating.
See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus.
It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor:
Adults older than age 65
Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms
People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system
For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition."

Trouble breathing.
Dry cough that usually doesn't bring up any mucus.
Loss of appetite.
Fever.
Joint and muscle pain.
Headache.
Weight loss."
POEMS syndrome,"The symptoms of POEMS syndrome make up its name. Symptoms most often appear over weeks to months. They include the following:
Polyneuropathy.This may include numbness, tingling and weakness in the legs. In time, it might affect the hands. It also involves trouble breathing. Polyneuropathy must be present for a POEMS diagnosis.
Organomegaly.This is an enlarged spleen, liver or lymph nodes.
Monoclonal protein.This is a protein that atypical plasma cells in bone marrow make. The monoclonal protein goes into the bloodstream. This must be present for the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome. Monoclonal protein often is linked with bones getting harder or thicker.
Skin changes.This may involve having more color than usual on the skin. There may be red spots, which may be harder to see on Black or brown skin. The skin might be thicker. There might be more hair on the face or the legs.
Not all the symptoms of POEMS syndrome are in the name. And not everyone with POEMS syndrome has all the symptoms in the name. But everyone with POEMS syndrome has polyneuropathy and monoclonal protein.
Other symptoms some people with POEMS syndrome have spell out PEST. PEST stands for:
Papilledema.This is swelling in the back of the eyes.
Thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis.These are higher levels of red cells and platelets in the bloodstream."
Poison ivy rash,"Signs and symptoms of a poison ivy rash include:
Redness
Itching
Swelling
Blisters
Difficulty breathing, if you've inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy
The severity of the rash depends on the amount of urushiol that gets on your skin."
Polymyositis,"The muscle weakness associated with polymyositis involves the muscles closest to the trunk, such as those in your hips, thighs, shoulders, upper arms and neck. The weakness affects both the left and right sides of your body, and tends to gradually worsen."
Stomach polyps,"Stomach polyps usually don't cause symptoms.
But as a stomach polyp enlarges, open sores called ulcers can develop on its surface. Rarely, the polyp can block the opening between your stomach and your small intestine.

Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea
Decreased tolerance of cold temperatures"
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within the first three months after a traumatic event. But sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms last more than one month and cause major problems in social or work situations and how well you get along with others. They also can affect your ability to do your usual daily tasks.
Generally,PTSDsymptoms are grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person."

Fine hair that covers much of the body.
Low body temperature, mainly right after birth in the delivery room.
Trouble breathing.
Feeding problems."
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS),"For some, the physical pain and emotional stress are severe enough to affect their daily lives. Regardless of symptom severity, the signs and symptoms generally disappear within four days after the start of the menstrual period for most women.
But a small number of women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have disabling symptoms every month. This form of PMS is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).
Joint or muscle pain
Headache
Fatigue
Weight gain related to fluid retention

Mild belly cramps.
Vaginal spotting or light bleeding.
A gush or an ongoing trickle of fluid after the sac around the unborn baby, called the fetus, breaks or tears.
Fluid from the vagina that is watery, bloody or filled with mucus."
Primary immunodeficiency,"One of the most common signs of primary immunodeficiency is having infections that are more frequent, longer lasting or harder to treat than are the infections of someone with a typical immune system. You may also get infections that a person with a healthy immune system likely wouldn't get (opportunistic infections).
Signs and symptoms differ depending on the type of primary immunodeficiency disorder, and they vary from person to person.
Signs and symptoms of primary immunodeficiency can include:
Frequent and recurrent pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, ear infections, meningitis or skin infections

Swollen
Warm
Severely painful"
Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect,"Symptoms of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, also called PA-VSD, may appear at birth or very soon after. They can include:
Blue or gray skin. This change may be harder or easier to see depending on skin color.
Fast breathing or shortness of breath.
Tiredness.
Poor feeding."
Pulmonary valve disease,"Symptoms of pulmonary valve disease depend on the specific valve condition and how much blood flow is changed or blocked. Some babies are born with pulmonary valve disease. Symptoms may be noticed soon after birth. But sometimes symptoms aren't seen until later in life.
In general, pulmonary valve disease symptoms may include:
Chest pain.
Shortness of breath at rest or when active or lying down.
Fatigue.
Fainting."
Pulmonary valve stenosis,"Pulmonary valve stenosis symptoms may include:
A whooshing sound called a heart murmur that can be heard with a stethoscope.
Fatigue.

Pyloric stenosis,"Symptoms of pyloric stenosis usually appear within 3 to 6 weeks after birth. Pyloric stenosis is rare in babies older than 3 months.
Symptoms include:
Vomiting after feeding.The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several feet away. This is known as projectile vomiting. Vomiting usually happens right after feeding. Vomiting might be mild at first and worsen over time.
Constant hunger.Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting.
Stomach contractions.Wavelike ripples across your baby's belly may be visible after feeding but before vomiting. This is a sign of the stomach muscles trying to move food out of the stomach.
Dehydration.A baby may show signs of low body fluids, also called dehydration. These signs may include few wet diapers, lack of energy, dry mouth and lips, and crying without tears.
Changes in stool.Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated.
Weight loss.The lack of nutrition can cause a baby not to gain weight or to lose weight."

Spinal cord injury,"The ability to control your arms or legs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors. One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord. The other factor is how bad the injury is.
The lowest part of the spinal cord not damaged after an injury is known as the neurological level of the injury. ""The completeness"" of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost. Completeness is classified as:
Complete.If all feeling and all ability to control movement are lost below the spinal cord injury, the injury is called complete.
Incomplete.If some feeling and control of movement remain below the affected area, the injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury.
Loss of feeling and control of movement is known as paralysis. Paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as:
Tetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia.This means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury.
Paraplegia.This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs but not the arms.
Your healthcare team performs a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury.
Spinal cord injuries can cause the following symptoms:
Loss of movement.
Loss of or a change in sensation. This includes a change in the ability to feel heat, cold and touch.
Loss of bowel or bladder control.
Pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in the spinal cord.

Tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure,"Tonic-clonic seizures have two stages:
Tonic phase.Often, someone in the tonic phase will make a sound, such as a groan or yell. The muscles suddenly get stiff and cause the person to fall down. Loss of consciousness occurs. This phase tends to last about 10 to 20 seconds.
The following symptoms occur in some but not all people with tonic-clonic seizures:
Loss of bowel and bladder function.This may happen during or following a seizure.
Not responding after convulsions.The person may not become conscious for several minutes after convulsions have ended.
Confusion.The person often is disoriented after a tonic-clonic seizure. This is referred to as postictal confusion.
Fatigue.Sleepiness is common after a tonic-clonic seizure.
Bad headache.Headaches may occur after a tonic-clonic seizure."
Temporal lobe seizure,"An odd feeling called an aura may happen before a temporal lobe seizure. An aura acts as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras. And not everyone who has auras remembers them.
The aura is the first part of a focal seizure before a loss of consciousness.
A sudden sense of fear or joy.
A feeling that what's happening has happened before, known as deja vu.
A sudden or strange odor or taste.
A rising feeling in the belly that feels like being on a roller coaster
Sometimes temporal lobe seizures keep people from responding to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure most often lasts 30 seconds to 2 minutes.

Witnessed breathing pauses during sleep
Difficulty concentrating
Morning headaches
Sore throat upon awakening
Restless sleep
Gasping or choking at night
Chest pain at night
Your snoring is so loud it's disrupting your partner's sleep
In children, poor attention span, behavioral issues or poor performance in school
OSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound.
You may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night."
Specific phobias,"Common types of specific phobias are fears of:
Situations, such as airplanes, driving, enclosed spaces or going to school.
Nature, such as thunderstorms, heights or the dark.
Animals or insects, such as dogs, snakes or spiders.

Others, such as choking, throwing up, loud noises or clowns.
No matter what specific phobia you have, you may:
Know that your fears are not reasonable or not as big as you think they are, but you cannot control them.
Have trouble with daily activities because of your fear.
Have physical reactions and feelings, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or trouble breathing.
Feel like throwing up, or you get dizzy or faint, especially around blood or injuries.
Children may have tantrums, or they may cling, cry or refuse to leave a parent's side or approach their fear.
When to see a doctor
Childhood fears, such as fear of the dark, monsters or of being left alone, are common. Most children outgrow them. But if your child has an ongoing, strong fear that interferes with how they act at school or work daily, talk to your child's doctor.
The right therapy can help most people. And the sooner you ask for help, the more likely that therapy will be effective."
Spider bites,"Typically, a spider bite looks like any other bug bite — a red, inflamed, sometimes itchy or painful bump on your skin — and may even go unnoticed. Harmless spider bites usually don't produce any other symptoms.
Many skin sores look the same but have other causes, such as a bacterial infection.
Bites from some spiders, such as widow spiders and recluse spiders, might cause serious signs and symptoms.
Signs and symptoms of a widow spider bite can include:

Spina bifida,"Symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and from one person to another.
Spina bifida occulta.Typically, there aren't any symptoms of spina bifida occulta because the spinal nerves aren't involved. But you can sometimes see symptoms on the newborn's skin above the small gap in the spine. You might see a tuft of hair, a small dimple or a birthmark. Sometimes, these skin marks can be symptoms of a spinal cord issue that can be found withMRIor a spinal ultrasound in a newborn.
Meningocele.This type may affect bladder and bowel function."
Spinal cord tumor,"Spinal cord tumors may not cause signs and symptoms at first. When symptoms happen, they might start in the part of the spine near the tumor. As a spinal cord tumor grows, it can hurt nearby nerves and cause symptoms in other parts of the body.
In the spine, spinal cord tumor symptoms include:
Pain near the spot where the tumor forms.
Pain that feels worse at night.
Pain that gets worse over time.
A spinal cord tumor that grows to hurt the nearby nerves can cause symptoms that happen along those nerves. Symptoms may include:

If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks.
Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Artificial joints may also be at risk of infection. Signs and symptoms may include:
This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually has large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust.

Serious congenital heart defects are often diagnosed before or soon after a child is born. If you think that your baby has symptoms of total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), call your child's healthcare professional."
Tuberculosis,"When TB germs survive and multiply in the lungs, it is called a TB infection. A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are different in each stage.
Primary TB infection.The first stage is called the primary infection. Immune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may completely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and multiply.
Most people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as:
Latent TB infection.Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent TB infection.
Active TB disease.Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But it usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection.
Symptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks. They may include:
Common sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include:
Active TB disease in children.Symptoms of active TB disease in children vary. Typically, symptoms by age may include the following:
