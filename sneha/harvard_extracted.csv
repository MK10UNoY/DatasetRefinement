If anal itch becomes a chronic (long-term) problem, the skin around the anus may become raw and tender from repeated scratching, or it may thicken and become leathery. Repeated scratching also can cause breaks in the anal skin that can lead to painful local infections.
"
Anaphylaxis,
Angina,
Ankle Fracture,
Ankle Sprain,"Most sprains happen when the ankle twists suddenly. The most common injuries happen when the foot rolls onto the outside of the ankle, straining the outside ligaments of the ankle joint. These are called inversion injuries. Less common are eversion injuries, which happen when the ankle rolls onto the inside of the joint, stretching the ligaments on the inner side of the ankle.
Symptoms of a sprained ankle include:

When full-blown symptoms occur, they usually begin two to seven days after exposure toCampylobacter.At first, you may have a 12- to 48-hour period of fever, headache, muscle aches, and malaise (a general feeling of sickness). These early symptoms are followed by crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. There may be up to 10 loose stools watery stools per day. You may notice some blood in the stool.

"Chronic Otitis Media, Cholesteatoma and Mastoiditis",
Chronic Pancreatitis,"The most common symptom is upper abdominal pain, which often radiates to the back and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. The pain can occur daily or off and on, and can be mild or intense. As the disease gets worse and more of the pancreas is destroyed, pain may actually become less severe. During an attack, the pain often is made worse by drinking alcohol or eating a large meal high in fats.
Because a damaged pancreas can't produce important digestive enzymes, people with chronic pancreatitis may develop problems with digesting and absorbing food and nutrients. This can lead to weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, diarrhea, and greasy, foul-smelling stools. Over time, a damaged pancreas also can fail to produce enough insulin, which results in diabetes.

Symptoms most often appear immediately after the injury. However, in some cases, a person will feel fine at first and have the symptoms minutes to hours later.
Symptoms such as coma (unresponsiveness), seizures, or paralysis or weakness of an arm or leg suggest a more serious form of head injury.
"
Constipation and Impaction,
Contact Dermatitis,
Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder),
Corneal Abrasion,
Corns and Calluses,
Coronary Artery Disease,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD),"CJD does not cause any symptoms at first. The first symptoms include slow thinking, difficulty concentrating, impaired judgment and memory loss.  These symptoms also occur with other diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, so CJD can be hard to diagnose, at first.
Soon, however, begins a severe, progressive dementia. People neglect themselves, become apathetic or irritable, and start having strong muscle spasms. Then people become completely bedridden, and eventually lapse into coma. Comatose patients may die as a result of infection associated with being immobile, such as pneumonia.

"
Delusional Disorder,"The main symptom is a persistent delusion or delusions (a fixed belief) — for example, about a situation, condition, or action – that is not happening but may be plausible in real life. Types include:
"
Dementia,
Depression Overview,"A depressed person may gain or lose weight, eat more or less than usual, have difficulty concentrating, and have trouble sleeping or sleep more than usual. He or she may feel tired and have no energy for work or play. Small burdens or obstacles may appear impossible to manage. The person can appear slowed down, or agitated and restless. The symptoms can be quite noticeable to others.
A particularly painful symptom of this illness is an unshakable feeling of worthlessness and guilt. The person may feel guilty about a specific life experience, or may feel general guilt not related to anything in particular.
If pain and self-criticism become great enough, they can lead to feelings of hopelessness, self-destructive behavior, or thoughts of death and suicide. The vast majority of people who suffer severe depression do not attempt or complete suicide, but they are more likely to do so than people who are not depressed.
Symptoms of major depression include:
People with persistent depressive disorder may have many of the same symptoms, although fewer symptoms are needed to make the diagnosis, and these symptoms are long-lasting.
"
Dermatofibroma,
Detached Retina,
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip,
Deviated Septum,"Symptoms of a deviated septum can include:
In some cases, people with a mildly deviated septum have symptoms only when they also have a cold or other upper respiratory tract infection. In these people, the respiratory infection causes nose tissues to swell, which can make airflow problems worse. Once the cold goes away, the symptoms of a deviated septum often go away, too.
"
Diabetes Mellitus Overview,"Diabetes initially might not cause any symptoms. It can sometimes be caught early with a routine blood test before a person develops symptoms.
When diabetes does cause symptoms, they may include:
People with diabetes also have an increased susceptibility to infections, especially yeast (Candida) infections.
When the amount of insulin in the blood stream is too low, extremely high blood sugar levels can lead to dangerous complications. The body can become too acidic, a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Or the blood sugar level gets so high, the person becomes severely dehydrated. It's called hyperosmolar syndrome.
The symptoms of these complications include confused thinking, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and even seizures and coma. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar syndrome is the first sign that a person has diabetes.
The treatment of diabetes also can produce symptoms. Too much glucose-lowering medicine, relative to dietary intake, can lead to a blood sugar level that has dropped too low (called hypoglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia include:
You can correct hypoglycemia by eating or drinking something that has carbohydrates. This raises your blood sugar level.
Long-term diabetes can have other complications, including:
"
Diabetic Ketoacidosis,"Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:
As blood ketone levels increase, the person's breathing pattern may become slow and deep, and his or her breath can have a fruity odor. A person with ketoacidosis may seem to be tired or confused or may have trouble paying attention. Without prompt treatment in the first day of symptoms, the illness may cause low blood pressure, a loss of consciousness, coma or death.
If you have type 1 diabetes, it is important to frequently measure your blood glucose levels. If your levels are running high or you are prone to ketoacidosis, you will want to test your urine for ketones. If the urine test strip reads ""moderate"" or ""large,"" it's possible you have ketoacidosis.
"
Diabetic Nephropathy,"There are usually no symptoms in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy. When symptoms do begin to appear, they may include ankle swelling and mild fatigue. Later symptoms include extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and urinating less than usual.
"
Diabetic Neuropathies,"Most people who have had diabetes for 25 years have some form of neuropathy. Symptoms depend on the specific type of neuropathy.
If your feet are numb, you may not be aware when shoes don't fit properly. This can lead to the formation of a callus. These thickened skin areas can break down over time. They can change into an open sore (ulcer) that may become infected.
"
Diarrhea,
Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis,
Down Syndrome,"In addition to the characteristic physical features and decreased mental abilities, other health problems frequently are seen in people with Down syndrome. These include:
People with Down syndrome develop leukemia more often than those without the disorder, and they are more likely to develop infections, problems with the immune system, skin disorders and seizures.
Infants with Down syndrome usually develop more slowly than other children of the same age, although a wide variation is seen. Language development is typically much slower, as is motor development. Their body strength may seem a little weak. For example, most toddlers walk between 12 and 14 months of age, but toddlers with Down syndrome walk between 15 and 36 months.
"
Drooping Eyelid (Ptosis),
Dry Eye Syndrome,
Dry Skin,"Sometimes, the only symptom of dry skin is itching, although most people also will notice that their skin is flaky and slightly more wrinkled than normal. Symptoms of dry skin may worsen during the winter months, especially if you spend a lot of time indoors, where the heated air is dry.
"
Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding,
Dyslexia,
Dysthymia,"The main symptom of persistent depressive disorder is a long-lasting low or sad mood. Children and adolescents with persistent depressive disorder may be irritable. Other symptoms include:
"
Dysuria,"Depending on the cause of dysuria, there may be other symptoms in addition to pain when urinating. Symptoms can include:
"
Earache,"Earache is most commonly described as a feeling of pressure in the ear. This feeling may begin gradually or suddenly, and it can be very severe. Other symptoms such as hearing loss, fever and feeling unwell usually indicate an ear infection.
When the ear canal is inflamed or if the eardrum ruptures, there may be drainage from the ear. If the eardrum ruptures because of a middle ear infection, the pain is often relieved because the pressure is reduced. In young children, the only signs of an ear infection may be fever, irritability and pulling at the ear.
"
Eczema,
Edema,"Symptoms vary according to the type of edema and its location. In general, the skin above the swollen area will be stretched and shiny.
"
Emphysema,"During the early stages of emphysema, most people will have few symptoms. The disease usually progresses slowly. Changes in breathing may be hardly noticed. A typical person will not experience symptoms until they have smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for more than 20 years.
However, over time, almost all people with emphysema will develop shortness of breath. At first, this may be noticed only during strenuous activities, such as climbing several flights of stairs or playing sports. As time goes on, the shortness of breath may occur with daily activities, such as housework or walking short distances. Eventually, the person may be short of breath for much of the day, even while at rest or sleeping. At its worst, emphysema can cause ""air hunger."" This is the constant feeling of being unable to catch one's breath.
These respiratory symptoms are the same regardless of the cause of the emphysema. However, two people with the same degree of lung damage may have different symptoms. One person with mild emphysema may feel very short of breath. Another person with more advanced stages of the disease may be hardly bothered by symptoms.
Other symptoms caused by emphysema include:
"
Encephalitis,"The symptoms of encephalitis range from mild to severe and can be life-threatening. Fortunately, most cases are not severe. Possible symptoms, beginning with the two most common, include the following:
Many of these symptoms also occur in other conditions that affect the brain, including migraine headaches and life-threatening conditions such as bleeding in the brain. When a person has a fever along with the other symptoms, some kind of infection is most likely.
"
Encopresis (Fecal Soiling),"In most children with encopresis, the most obvious signs are:
Other signs and symptoms may include:
Periods of constipation (no bowel movements) alternating with very large bowel movements
Streaks of blood on the outside of stool, or on toilet tissue used to wipe after a bowel movement
Pain in the lower abdomen or rectum
Stool-stained clothes hidden in closets, under the bed or elsewhere
Bedwetting, probably related to pressure from the large chunk of stool in the rectum
In rarer cases, when encopresis is caused by serious psychological problems, a child may drop or smear stool on floors, walls or furniture.
"
End-Stage Renal Disease,
Endocarditis,"Symptoms of acute endocarditis include:
Symptoms of subacute endocarditis include:
"
Endometriosis,
Endophthalmitis,"The most common symptoms are loss of vision and pain. Additional symptoms vary. They depend on what caused the eye infection:
"
Enlarged Prostate (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia),"An enlarged prostate can make it more difficult to urinate. Not all men who have an enlarged prostate experience symptoms. However, about one-fourth of all men in the United States report some trouble urinating.
At first, symptoms may be mild because the bladder muscle is able to compensate for the pressure from the enlarged prostate on the urethra.
The pressure of the prostate on the urethra causes an interrupted or weak stream of urine. Other symptoms include:
The severity of these problems depends on how much pressure the prostate is putting on the urethra.
Another set of symptoms happens when the urine that collects in the bladder causes irritation. These symptoms include:
Potentially serious complications can occur if the bladder does not empty completely. Urine that does not exit the bladder can lead to the growth of bacteria, which can cause frequent urinary tract infections. Also, urinary stones can form in the bladder lining due to an accumulation of debris and chemicals. Broken blood vessels can cause blood in the urine, often because of torn or enlarged veins on the inner surface of the prostate. Blood in the urine also can be caused by the sudden stretching of the bladder wall. If left untreated, urine retained in the bladder can back up into the kidneys, which can cause kidney failure over time.
"
Epidemic Pleurodynia,"Once inside the body, the coxsackieviruses multiply in the throat and intestines then spread into the bloodstream. At this point, the body's immune defenses often can limit the infection and prevent the person from developing symptoms. If the immune defenses are less successful, the person develops a fever or other symptoms, such as headache, nausea and vomiting, and sore throat. Only a few infected people develop the classic muscle pain in the chest and upper abdomen that gives the disease its name. In these people, the coxsackievirus infection has settled in the muscles of the chest and upper abdomen, causing inflammation there.
The chest pain usually feels worse with deep breathing, called pleuritic pain. It can be a severe, stabbing pain or it can be a milder cramping in the side. Usually, only one side of the chest or abdomen is affected, although occasionally the pain can include muscles of the neck or arms.
The pain usually comes in waves that last 15 to 30 minutes, although some people report having pain episodes that last for several hours. The pain can be so severe that you have trouble breathing, sweat a lot and become anxious.
"
Epidermoid Cyst,"A cyst is a movable, dome-shaped, smooth-surfaced mass that varies in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters (from less than a quarter of an inch to more than 2 inches). Epidermoid cysts can occur on almost any skin surface.
"
Epididymitis And Orchitis,"Symptoms of epididymitis and orchitis can include:
"
Epiglottitis,"The most common signs and symptoms of epiglottitis include:
"
Epilepsy,
Esophageal Cancer,
Esophageal Rings And Webs,"Most esophageal rings and webs do not cause any symptoms, and are discovered when people have barium x-rays or endoscopy for unrelated reasons. When rings or webs do cause symptoms, the most common complaint is difficulty swallowing solids. Foods, especially meats and breads, may feel like they get stuck in the same place.
Food occasionally can become lodged in the esophagus and require an endoscopic procedure to unblock the esophagus.
"
Esophageal Varices,"Portal hypertension often does not cause any symptoms. Sometimes it is first discovered when the varices bleed. When significant bleeding occurs, a person will vomit blood, often in large amounts. People with massive bleeding feel dizzy and may lose consciousness.
Some people bleed in smaller amounts over a longer period, and they swallow the blood rather than vomit. Their stools may contain red or tarry-black blood.
People with esophageal varices caused by cirrhosis will usually have other symptoms related to their liver disease.
"
Esophagitis,"The main symptoms of esophagitis are:
"
Essential Tremor,
Ewing's Sarcoma,
Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors,
Eye Socket Fracture (Fracture Of The Orbit),"Symptoms vary, depending on the location and severity of the fracture, but can include:
"
Fallen Arch,"The majority of children and adults with flexible flatfeet never have symptoms. However, their toes may tend to point outward as they walk, a condition called out-toeing. A person who develops symptoms usually complains of tired, aching feet, especially after prolonged standing or walking.
Symptoms of rigid flatfoot vary depending on the cause of the foot problem:
"
Fallopian Tube Cancer,
Familial Dysautonomia,
Farsightedness (Hyperopia),"Symptoms of farsightedness can include:
During childhood and adolescence, many people who have inherited short eyes do not show symptoms of farsightedness because their youthful eyes are so good at accommodating. With time, however, age-related changes in the lens can make the process of accommodation less effective, and symptoms of farsightedness eventually appear.
"
Febrile Seizures,"Signs of a febrile seizure may include
"
Fecal Incontinence,
Felon,"A felon causes extreme pain at the fingertip, especially when pressure is applied to the ""fingerprint"" surface. The end of the finger swells, is warm and turns red. There may be an accumulation of a white, thick discharge (pus). As the felon increases, the fingertip may feel numb, and bending the finger may be painful.
"
Female Infertility,
Fever,"Common symptoms associated with fever include sweating, shivering, headaches, muscle aches, poor appetite, rash, restlessness and general body weakness. High fever can lead to symptoms of mental dysfunction, such as confusion, excessive sleepiness, irritability and convulsions (seizures).
Convulsions triggered by fever (febrile seizures) are common among children younger than 5 years. These seizures usually occur at the beginning of an illness when temperature rises rapidly. In infants and toddlers, febrile seizures typically cause generalized shaking and muscle rigidity. They usually last one to three minutes and are often followed by a long period of sleep.
Specific symptoms associated with a fever often can provide clues to help identify the fever's cause. For example, a fever accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea may signal gastroenteritis, and a fever associated with coughing, shortness of breath and grayish-yellow phlegm may indicate pneumonia.
"
Fibroids,
Fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia can cause pain and stiffness in the muscles and joints almost anywhere in the body, including the trunk, neck, shoulders, back, and hips. People often have pain between the shoulder blades and at the bottom of the neck. Pain may be either a general soreness or a gnawing ache, and stiffness is often worst in the morning.
Typically, people also complain of feeling abnormally tired, especially of waking up tired, although they have slept well. Many people with fibromyalgia also have tender points, which are specific spots on the body that are painful to touch. Some people report symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, depression, anxiety, and headache.
For research studies, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has established criteria for fibromyalgia that include a combination of unexplained symptoms such as pain, fatigue, waking without feeling rested, and/or problems with thinking or memory. But doctors often make the diagnosis in people with widespread pain and no other identifiable cause, even if criteria are not met.
"
Fifth Disease (Erythema Infectiosum),"Sometimes, fifth disease does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include mild cold symptoms (stuffy nose, runny nose, slight fever), body aches, headache and fatigue. These symptoms pass after three or four days and are followed primarily in children by a rash that is bright red and usually begins on the cheeks (the ""slapped cheek"" rash). This facial rash is followed by a lacy, flat rash that appears on the arms, legs, trunk and buttocks. The blotchy rash may itch, and it may last from several days to several weeks before it fades. Even after the rash clears, it sometimes may reappear if the skin is irritated by rubbing, heat, cold, exercise or exposure to sunlight.
Adolescents and adults with fifth disease may not have any symptoms or they may develop the typical rash, joint pain and swelling (most often at the knuckles, wrists and knees) or both.
Children who have blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and hemolytic anemia, and those with immune deficiency or cancer rarely get the rash of fifth disease. Instead, they may develop severe anemia (not enough red blood cells) as a result of being infected with parvovirus B19. The symptoms can include paleness, rapid breathing, rapid pulse, fever and malaise (a general sick feeling).
"
Finger Dislocation,"A dislocated finger is crooked, painful and swollen, and its surface skin may be cut, scraped or bruised. If a dislocated finger has been straightened on the playing field, it may feel abnormally loose, weak or unstable afterward.
"
Flu (Influenza),"Flu can cause a variety of symptoms. They can be mild or severe. Symptoms and illness severity depend on the type of virus, your age and overall health.
Although it is a respiratory virus, flu can affect other body systems. This makes you feel sick all over. Symptoms can include any or all of the following:
Dangerous complications, such as pneumonia, can develop from flu. The influenza virus can be the direct cause of pneumonia. But also infection with influenza makes a person more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia.
Certain people are especially vulnerable to complications. These include:
"
Food Allergy,
Food Poisoning,"Symptoms of food poisoning include:
"
Foot Sprain,"In a mild or moderate midfoot sprain, your midfoot area will be swollen and tender, and there may be some local bruising (black and blue discoloration). In more severe sprains, you may not be able to bear weight on your injured foot.
If you have turf toe, the base of your big toe will be painful and swollen.
"
Foot Ulcers,"A foot ulcer looks like a red crater in the skin. Most foot ulcers are located on the side or bottom of the foot or on the top or tip of a toe. This round crater can be surrounded by a border of thickened, callused skin. This border may develop over time. In very severe ulcers, the red crater may be deep enough to expose tendons or bones.
If the nerves in the foot are functioning normally, then the ulcer will be painful. If not, then a person with a foot ulcer may not know it is there, particularly if the ulcer is located on a less obvious portion of the foot.
In disabled or elderly patients, a relative or caregiver may be the one who becomes aware of the problem. The caregiver may notice that foot looks red and swollen. There may be drainage on the sock and a foul odor.
"
Foreign Body In Eye,"Symptoms can include itching, irritation or redness of the eye. If you have a corneal abrasion, you may have eye pain, light sensitivity and blurry vision.
"
Foreign Objects In The Ear,
Fragile X Syndrome,
Friction Blisters,"A friction blister is a small pocket of puffy, raised skin containing clear fluid. It is usually painful when touched. A blister can appear anywhere.
"
Friedreich's Ataxia,
Gallbladder and bile duct cancer,
Gallstones,"Eighty percent of people with gallstones do not have any symptoms and do not need treatment. When gallstones do cause symptoms, you might experience:
Occasionally, gallstones cause more serious complications, including pancreatitis or infections in the gallbladder or bile ducts. If one of these problems occurs, you may experience fever, more severe abdominal pain, or jaundice (a yellow color of the skin or whites of the eyes).
"
Gas (Flatulence),"Flatulence is the passing of intestinal gas, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Some people who have flatulence also complain of abdominal bloating, but others do not.
"
Gastritis,"Symptoms of gastritis can include:
Although gastritis can occur in people of all ages and backgrounds, it is more common in:
"
Gastroenteritis In Adults,"In adults, symptoms of gastroenteritis typically include mild diarrhea (fewer than 10 watery stools daily), abdominal pain and cramps, low-grade fever (below 101° Fahrenheit), headache, nausea and sometimes vomiting. In some cases, there can be bloody diarrhea.
"
Gastroenteritis In Children,
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD),"Symptoms of GERD may include
"
Gastrointestinal Amebiasis,"In more than 90% of cases, the infecting strain of amoeba does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they usually begin within months after amoebas first enter the body. In some people, the symptoms are mild, consisting of mild pain and gurgling sounds in the lower abdomen, along with two or three loose stools daily. In other people, however, there can be full-blown symptoms of amoebic dysentery, including high fever, severe abdominal pain, and 10 or more episodes of diarrhea daily. Typically, this diarrhea is watery or contains blood and mucus.
When amoebas spread to the liver and cause liver abscess, symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting, pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen, weight loss, and an enlarged liver. It is possible for a person to develop symptoms of an amoebic liver abscess without ever having had the diarrhea typical of infection.
"
Gaucher Disease,
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"In generalized anxiety disorder, the person has persistent worry or anxiety that lasts for at least several months. (The diagnostic manual in psychiatry sets the minimum to 6 months, but you don't need to use a precise timer to seek help.)
Worry or anxiety is excessive, troubling and hard to control. It often interferes with the ability to function at home, at work or in social situations.
Feeling restless or keyed up Here are some of the other defining symptoms or behaviors common in the disorder:
People with generalized anxiety disorder also may have physical symptoms that feel like symptoms of heart disease, respiratory illness, digestive diseases and other medical illnesses.
"
Generalized Seizures (Grand Mal Seizures),
Genital Herpes,"Many people with genital herpes infection have no symptoms. When symptoms appear, they can include
Less common problems related to genital herpes include
The first episode of herpes symptoms usually has the worst symptoms. When symptoms develop, they can occur from a few days to a few weeks after contact with an infected person, but sometimes an infected person might not have any symptoms for years. Almost everyone with symptomatic genital herpes will have at least one recurrence. In people who have repeated herpes episodes, symptoms can be triggered by physical or emotional stress.
Newborns infected with herpes around the time of delivery usually develop symptoms five to nine days after birth. Symptoms can include blisters on the skin, eyes, and mouth. If the virus spreads through the baby's bloodstream to the brain, there can be sleepiness or irritability, and seizures. The virus can also spread to the baby's liver, lungs, and other organs, causing disseminated (widespread) disease. Herpes in a newborn can be from either HSV-1 or HSV-2, but HSV-2 tends to cause more severe disease.
"
Genital Warts,
Gestational Diabetes,"Some pregnant women with gestational diabetes have the symptoms of diabetes that are associated with high blood glucose (hyperglycemia). These include:
However, some women have no recognizable symptoms. This is why screening tests for this disease are recommended for all pregnant women.
"
Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis),"The most common symptom is a dull, throbbing headache, often at one or both sides of the forehead, although it can be anywhere over the head or into the neck. Other common symptoms include one or more of the following:
"
Giardiasis,
Glaucoma,
Glioblastoma Multiforme,"As brain tumors grow, they press against or damage nerves or other parts of the brain and interfere with thought, memory, emotion, movement, vision, hearing, touch, and other brain functions. Swelling and fluid buildup can also affect brain function.
The most common symptoms of glioblastoma are
Many other conditions can cause these symptoms, but call your doctor promptly if you experience any of these problems.
"
Gonorrhea,
Gout,"The first attack of gouty arthritis usually involves only one joint, most commonly the big toe. However, it can affect other joints, such as a knee, ankle, wrist, foot or finger. In gouty arthritis, the joint can become red, swollen and extremely tender to the touch. Typically, even a bed sheet brushing against the joint will trigger intense pain.
After the first attack of gout, later episodes are more likely to involve more than one joint at the same time. Sometimes, if gout lasts for many years, uric acid crystals can collect in the joints or tendons, under the skin, or on the outside the ears, forming a whitish deposit called a tophus.

"
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,"When GPA first develops, most people have upper respiratory complaints. Common symptoms of GPA include:
As the disease gets worse, upper respiratory symptoms usually worsen. Other parts of the body can be affected, too.
The following symptoms may occur, depending on the location and severity of the inflammation:
"
Graves' Disease,
Graves' Eye Disease (Graves' Ophthalmopathy),
Guillain-Barre Syndrome,"Symptoms of Guillain-Barr' syndrome vary from person to person and may be mild or severe. Most often, the first obvious symptom is weakness, and most often the weakness is felt in both legs. Over time, the weakness often involves the arms or head, affecting eye and head movement and speech. Occasionally, the weakness will affect the arms or muscles of the head before affecting the legs.
Sometimes the weakness is preceded or accompanied by a sensation of tingling, most often in the lower legs and feet. Guillain-Barr' syndrome can affect the body's autonomic nervous system and impair control of blood pressure, leading to dangerously low blood pressure when the person rises to stand after lying down or sitting.
The disorder may progress quickly, with most patients experiencing the worst weakness of legs, arms, chest and other muscle groups within three weeks of the start of the disease. In some cases, the weakness may worsen very rapidly. When this happens, weakness in the legs can become complete paralysis of the legs, arms and muscles of breathing within a day or two. For that reason, a person who develops sudden weakness in the legs or arms should contact a doctor immediately.
The weakness may last days, weeks or months before sensation begins to return. Returning to pre-illness strength and functioning can take months or years. Most patients return to normal within months.

Hair Loss,
Hammertoe,
Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis),"Symptoms of hay fever usually begin before age 30. They typically include:
The congested nose can lead to mouth breathing, and the dripping mucus can cause persistent cough and sore throat. Because hay fever also causes swelling in the sinuses and near the opening of the Eustachian tube (passage that connects the throat to the middle ear), sufferers can develop additional symptoms of secondary sinus infections or ear infections.
Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms, especially about when you have them and whether they occur outdoors or indoors. Your doctor also will ask about your family history of allergies and your personal history of allergy-related conditions, including eczema, hives and asthma.
"
Head and Neck Cancer,
Head Injury In Adults,"Head injuries can cause a wide variety of symptoms, depending on the type of injury, its severity, and its location. Some doctors classify head injuries into three categories, based on symptoms:
"
Head Injury In Children,
Head Lice,"The most common symptom of a head lice infestation is itching. This is caused mainly by the louse's saliva, which irritates the skin on the scalp. The itching can occasionally be severe enough to prevent sleep, and some people scratch so much that they cause additional skin infections. Head lice are not known to transmit any infections.
"
Headache Overview,"By definition, a headache is a pain in the head. But the type, location, and severity of pain are highly variable. And for migraine, there can be profound symptoms without a headache.
A person can simultaneously have multiple reasons for headaches. It's common for a person to have both migraine and tension-type headaches. And the symptoms of tension-type headaches and migraine headaches can overlap. For example, both types of headaches may be made worse by bright lights or loud noises.
In general, migraine headaches tend to throb. Tension-type headaches tend to cause a more constant pain. But the pain of either a migraine or a tension-type headache can be steady or throbbing, or can alternate between the two.
"
Hearing Loss in Adults,
Hearing Loss in Children,
Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction),"The most common symptom of a heart attack is chest pain, usually described as crushing, squeezing, pressing, heavy, or occasionally, stabbing or burning. Chest pain tends to be focused either in the center of the chest or just below the center of the rib cage, and it can spread to the arms, abdomen, neck, lower jaw or neck.
Other symptoms can include sudden weakness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, or lightheadedness. Sometimes, when a heart attack causes burning chest pain, nausea and vomiting, a patient may mistake his or her heart symptoms for indigestion.
"
Heart Failure,"The first symptom of heart failure often is fatigue. As the condition worsens, shortness of breath and wheezing occur during exertion. Eventually, shortness of breath and wheezing occur when you are resting. As fluid accumulates in the lungs, people with heart failure may begin to sleep propped up with pillows. This makes breathing easier. There also can be a chronic cough due to fluid accumulation in the lungs.
Fluid also can collect in the legs and ankles, causing swelling. In people who are less active, collected fluid can accumulate in the middle of the body. Some people urinate several times during the night as the kidneys drain off some of this excess fluid. As the body accumulates more and more fluid, the person may experience significant weight gain.
"
Heart Murmur,"An innocent murmur does not cause any symptoms. For other types of heart murmurs, symptoms vary depending on the cause. In general, when a heart murmur significantly interferes with the heart's ability to pump blood, you can experience one or more of the following symptoms:
"
Heart Valve Problems,"Many people with mild heart valve problems do not have any symptoms, and the abnormal valve is discovered only when a heart murmur is heard during a physical examination. For more severe heart valve problems, symptoms vary slightly depending on which valve is involved.
"
Heart Valve Replacement,
Heat Stroke (Hyperthermia),"Heat stroke can come on suddenly, but warning symptoms often appear first. They include:
When heat stroke starts, neurological symptoms can include:
"
Hematuria,
Hemochromatosis,"The early symptoms of hemochromatosis vary a lot from person to person and are general symptoms that also occur in other conditions. In fact, there may be no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Symptoms include:
As the condition progresses, your skin may take on a bronze or yellowish color. The disease can lead to organ failure, especially liver failure (cirrhosis), which can cause confusion, bleeding, fluid accumulation in the legs and abdomen, black or bloody stools, and jaundice. Deposits of iron in the heart can cause heart failure or an irregular heartbeat. If the pancreas is involved, you also can develop diabetes, which can cause frequent urination and excessive thirst.
"
Hemophilia,
Hemorrhagic Stroke,"Symptoms of a hemorrhagic stroke vary, depending on the cause:
"
Hemorrhoids,
Hepatitis A,
Hepatitis B,
Hepatitis C,
Hepatitis Overview,
Hereditary-Patterned Baldness,
Hernia,"Most hernias cause a bulge under the skin (except hiatus hernias). The location of this bulge depends on the specific type of hernia. For example, an inguinal hernia appears as a bulge in the groin, while an umbilical hernia appears as a bulge near the navel. Some hernias can cause twinges of pain or a pulling sensation, but most do not cause pain. Hernias are usually easier to see with coughing or straining. They also tend to be more prominent with standing and often disappear with lying down.
A hernia is considered incarcerated if a portion of intestine becomes trapped in the hernia and is unable to slide back into the abdomen. Rarely, the trapped intestine can strangulate. This means that the contained intestine dies because its blood supply has been cut off by the constriction of the hernia. This causes severe pain and requires urgent surgery.
"
Hernia Repair,
Herniated Disk,"The first symptom of a herniated disc is usually back pain in the area of the affected disc. Some researchers believe this pain is a signal that a disc's tough outer shell has been injured or weakened, not necessarily that the inner core has herniated. If the inner core does herniate and press on a nearby nerve, the resulting symptoms vary depending on the location of the herniated disc:
In most people with a lumbar disc herniation, severe leg pain is the chief complaint. This pain is called sciatica because it comes from pressure on the sciatic nerve. It usually begins in the lower back, then spreads into the buttocks and down the back of one thigh and leg. Sciatica typically becomes worse if the patient coughs, sneezes, bears down, or moves the back abruptly. While often relieved by rest, sciatica may become worse with driving or lifting. In addition, there may be numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness in the buttocks or leg on the side of the pain.
In rarer and more severe forms of lumbar disc herniation, the nerve is compressed more extensively. If this happens, additional symptoms can develop, including rectal pain; loss of bowel and bladder control; and numbness around the genital area, buttocks, or backs of the thighs.
"
Hiatal Hernia,
High Blood Pressure (Hypertension),"Usually, hypertension does not directly cause symptoms. When blood pressure is very high, it can cause headaches, dizziness, fatigue or visual symptoms.
"
High Cholesterol (Hypercholesterolemia),"Most people with high cholesterol don't have any symptoms until cholesterol-related atherosclerosis causes significant narrowing of the arteries leading to their hearts or brains. The result can be heart-related chest pain (angina) or other symptoms of coronary artery disease, as well as symptoms of decreased blood supply to the brain (transient ischemic attacks or stroke).
About 1 out of every 500 people has an inherited disorder called familial hypercholesterolemia, which can cause extremely high cholesterol levels (above 300 milligrams per deciliter). People with this disorder can develop nodules filled with cholesterol (xanthomas) over various tendons, especially the Achilles tendons of the lower leg. Cholesterol deposits also can occur on the eyelids, where they are called xanthelasmas.
"
Hip Fracture,
Hirsutism,"A woman with the mildest form of hirsutism may notice significant growth of hair that is mature (the same color as scalp hair) on the upper lip, chin, sideburn area, around the nipples or lower abdomen. More advanced hirsutism will cause mature hair to grow on the upper back, shoulders, sternum and upper abdomen. It most often begins during puberty. If hirsutism starts before or after puberty, the cause could be hormonal and the woman should be evaluated by a doctor.
"
HIV/AIDS,
Hives (Urticaria),
Hodgkin Lymphoma,
Hot Flashes,
Human Papillomavirus (HPV),
Huntington's Disease (Chorea),
Hydrocephalus,
Hyperkeratosis,"Many forms of hyperkeratosis are painless. However, corns, calluses and plantar warts can cause a great deal of discomfort.
"
Hyperthyroidism,"Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:
In women, menstrual periods may become less frequent or stop completely. Older people may develop heart failure or chest pain.
When Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism, you also may have swelling of tissues behind the eyes. This causes a characteristic protruding, staring appearance.
"
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia can cause:
"
Hypoparathyroidism,
Hypothyroidism,
Ichthyosis,
Illness Anxiety Disorder,
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP),
Impetigo,"Impetigo causes small bumps or blisters that burst. The skin underneath is moist, tender and red, and it oozes a clear liquid. A honey-colored crust, which may itch, then forms over the reddened area. If the disease is more severe, you also may have a fever and swelling of the lymph glands (swollen glands) in the face or neck.
"
Impotence (Erectile Dysfunction),
Infectious Arthritis,"Symptoms of infectious arthritis include:
Other symptoms vary, depending on the cause. Some more common causes of infectious arthritis include:
"
Infectious Mononucleosis,"The first symptoms of mononucleosis typically include:
Fever
Headaches
Muscle aches
Unusual fatigue, such as the need for 12 to 16 hours of sleep daily
These symptoms are followed very shortly by:
Sore throat
Enlarged lymph nodes
Chills
Joint aches
Loss of appetite and slight weight loss
Nausea and vomiting (occasionally)
A red rash, usually on the chest. This is more likely if the person has recently taken the antibiotics ampicillin or amoxicillin.
Abdominal pain
Enlarged spleen
Rare symptoms include:
Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes)
Difficulty breathing
Anemia
Irregular heart rhythms
In rare cases, an enlarged spleen can rupture. The spleen is a small organ near the stomach. Untreated, a ruptured spleen can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.
"
Ingrown Toenail,
Inguinal Hernia,
Insomnia,
Interstitial Cystitis,"Interstitial cystitis may cause:
"
Intracranial Aneurysms,"Most brain aneurysms don't cause symptoms until they burst. When an aneurysm ruptures, it often causes bleeding in the brain, which is a medical emergency. Bleeding in the brain usually leads to a very severe headache (often described as ""the worst headache of my life""). Brief loss of consciousness, nausea and vomiting, changes in vision, or neck stiffness may accompany the headache. If you experience these symptoms, call 911 or get to the emergency room as soon as possible.
A very large aneurysm may cause symptoms before it bursts, including pain above and behind the eye; numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the face; dilated pupils; and vision changes.
"
Iron Deficiency,"Mild iron deficiency may not cause any symptoms. When iron deficiency has progressed to actual anemia, there can be fatigue, breathlessness, unusually pale skin, and a decreased ability to exercise. People who have had severe iron deficiency for a prolonged period sometimes complain of trouble swallowing or have a sore mouth or tongue. In some cases, there can be unusually brittle fingernails or an abnormal curling and softness of the nails called spooning.
"
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),
Jet Lag,"Symptoms of jet lag can be mild or severe, depending on the number of time zones you cross and your sensitivity to such changes. The more time zones you cross, the more likely it is that your body rhythms will be disrupted, which can lead to more severe symptoms. Most people who cross five or more time zones will experience at least some symptoms, which can include
"
Jock Itch (Tinea Cruris),"A flat, red, itchy rash first appears high on the inner side of one or both thighs. It spreads outward in a ringlike circular pattern while the center clears up partially. The border is sharply marked, slightly raised and often beefy red in color. Jock itch can spread to the pubic and genital regions and sometimes to the buttocks.
"
Juvenile Arthritis,"Symptoms vary depending on the child and the specific disorder. Common symptoms include:
Other symptoms can include:
"
Kaposi's Sarcoma,
Kawasaki Disease,
Keloids,"Keloids usually appear in areas of previous trauma but may extend beyond the injured area. They are shiny, smooth and rounded skin elevations that may be pink, purple, or brown. They can be doughy or firm and rubbery to the touch, and they often feel itchy, tender or uncomfortable. They may be unsightly. A large keloid in the skin over a joint may interfere with joint function.
"
Keratitis,
Kidney Cancer,
Kidney Failure,"Symptoms vary depending on the type of renal injury or failure.
If left untreated, acute kidney injury may progress to renal failure, which can cause extra fluid to back up behind the heart into the lungs, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, confusion and behavioral changes.
"
Kidney Stones,
Knee Sprain,"Symptoms of a knee sprain vary depending on the specific ligament that is torn:
"
Lactose Intolerance,"Common symptoms of lactose intolerance include:
Flatulence that begins about 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating or drinking foods or drinks containing lactose.
The severity of symptoms varies, depending on the amount of lactose an individual can tolerate, the amount of lactose ingested, and the size and fat content of the meal. People who also have irritable bowel syndrome tend to have more severe symptoms from lactose intolerance.
"
Lacunar Stroke,"The symptoms of lacunar stroke vary depending on the part of the brain that is deprived of its blood supply. Different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions, such as sensation, movement, sight, speech, balance and coordination.
Symptoms can include:
In a person with prolonged, untreated high blood pressure, multiple lacunar strokes can occur. This can cause additional symptoms to develop, including emotional behavior and dementia.
The sudden appearance of one or more of these symptoms is a warning sign that a stroke may be in progress. Sometimes, the small clots that can cause a lacunar stroke interfere with blood flow only for a few minutes. If the clot dissolves before damage is done, then symptoms can begin to improve within minutes and may go away completely. When symptoms go away without treatment and full recovery occurs within 24 hours, the event is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Never decide to wait and see whether stroke symptoms will go away on their own. Get to an emergency room as quickly as possible to get treatment.
"
Langerhans' Cell Histiocytosis (Histiocytosis X),
Laryngitis,
Latex Allergy,
Lazy Eye (Amblyopia),
Lead Poisoning,
Leg Fracture,"If you have fractured the shaft of your femur, your symptoms may include:
If you have fractured the shaft of your tibia, or both your tibia and fibula, you may see:
A fibula fracture that occurs alone usually causes:
"
Leg Strain,"Symptoms of a strained leg muscle can include:
"
Leukemia (Overview),
Liver Cancer,"Symptoms usually do not appear until the disease is advanced. Symptoms can include:
Liver cancer can lead to high pressure in blood vessels that feed into the liver. This can cause veins in the esophagus and stomach to swell with significant risk of bleeding and vomiting blood.
"
Long QT Syndrome,"In most people, a prolonged QT interval does not cause any symptoms. The concern is that it can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), which may be life threatening. Arrhythmias can also cause fainting and shortness of breath.
"
Lung Cancer Overview,"In some cases, lung cancer is detected when a person with no symptoms has a chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan for another reason. But most people with lung cancer have one or more of these symptoms:
If the cancer has spread beyond the lungs, it can cause other symptoms. For example, you may have bone pain if it has spread to your bones.
Certain small cell lung cancers may secrete chemicals that can alter the body's chemical composition. For example, levels of sodium and calcium may be abnormal. This can lead to the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.
Many of these symptoms can be caused by other conditions. See your doctor if you have symptoms so that the problem can be diagnosed and properly treated.
"
Lyme Disease,
Lymphedema,
Lymphoma Overview,"The main symptom of both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas is swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under the arms, or in the groin. Other symptoms include:
Because swollen lymph nodes caused by lymphoma usually are painless, they may get larger over a long time before the person notices. Also, fever may come and go for several weeks. Even the unexplained weight loss may continue for months before the person sees a doctor.
"
Macular Degeneration,
Major Depression,
Malaria,"Symptoms of malaria can begin as early as six to eight days after a bite by an infected mosquito. They include
If treatment is delayed, more severe complications of malaria can occur. Most people who develop these complications are infected with theP. falciparumspecies. They include
"
Male Infertility,
Malignant Hyperthermia,
Marfan Syndrome,"Marfan syndrome affects each person differently, and the presence and severity of symptoms can vary. Most often, people with Marfan syndrome become aware of the disorder after they find out that someone else in their family has it or because of their appearance. People with Marfan syndrome typically are tall with long, thin extremities, with or without other skeletal changes.
Vision problems, including nearsightedness and ectopia lentis, usually develop. The symptoms, such as chest pain and shortness of breath, can be very dramatic if there is expansion of an aortic aneurysm or heart valve damage.
"
Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY),"Symptoms related to MODY tend to develop gradually. This is similar to what happens to people with type 2 diabetes. In comparison, the symptoms of type 1 diabetes often occur rather quickly over a few weeks.
Early symptoms of MODY may include blurry vision, recurrent skin infections, or yeast infections. But there may be no symptoms at all. People with MODY often have high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) for many years before they have any symptoms. The increased blood sugar develops gradually, and may only be noticed if a doctor does a blood sugar test during a checkup.
Without treatment, blood sugars will continue to rise, causing:
"
Measles (Rubeola),"Measles symptoms begin about 8 to 12 days after coming in contact with someone who has measles. The first symptoms include coughing, runny and stuffy nose, a general, sick feeling (malaise), red eyes with tearing (conjunctivitis), and a fever up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Within two to four days, these symptoms are followed by Koplik's spots in the mouth, bluish white or gray spots on a red background, seen inside the cheeks.
With a measles rash, you usually see non-itchy pink or bright red spots. The rash begins at the hairline and behind the ears, then spreads downward to the neck, trunk, arms and legs, palms and soles. The rash begins to fade about four days later in the same order that it appeared, first from the head and neck, then the trunk and arms and legs. The fading rash may leave behind a temporary brownish discoloration or flakiness that clears up two to three days later. Some people also have big lymph nodes (swollen glands), diarrhea and vomiting.
Patients with compromised immune systems are more likely to develop severe complications from measles, but they may not develop the typical measles rash.
"
Meckel's Diverticulum,"Most people with Meckel's diverticulum do not experience any symptoms. Symptoms occur only if the diverticulum bleeds, becomes infected, or causes an obstruction. These symptoms generally occur during the first few years of life, although they may not appear until adulthood. The bleeding, even when severe, is usually painless. An infection and blockage can cause mild to severe abdominal pain and discomfort.
Signs and symptoms may include
"
Medication Allergy,
Melanoma,
Melasma (Chloasma),
Ménière's Disease,"The cause of Ménière's disease is unknown. It tends to strike men and women equally, and although it can occur at any age, it usually begins between the ages of 30 and 50. In most cases, only one ear is affected. Only about 15 percent of people with Ménière's disease lose hearing in both ears.
The symptoms of Meniere's disease vary considerably from person to person. Some patients experience a cluster of attacks for a few weeks followed by years of relief, and other patients experience symptoms regularly for years.
A person with Ménière's disease may experience any or all of these symptoms:
"
Meningitis,"The symptoms of meningitis vary, but often include
Other symptoms may include
Symptoms may be milder in cases of viral meningitis, while in cases of bacterial meningitis, symptoms may come on quite suddenly. In very young children, symptoms may be particularly hard to detect. Babies with meningitis may be less active, vomit, refuse to eat, or be irritable. A person in later stages of bacterial meningitis may have seizures and lose consciousness (pass out).
"
Menopause And Perimenopause,
Mesothelioma,
Metastatic Brain Tumors,"The signs and symptoms of secondary brain tumors depend on their size and location. This is because different parts of the brain control different functions.
As a tumor grows, it can press against or destroy normal brain tissue. It can also increase pressure inside the skull.
Signs and symptoms of brain metastases include
These symptoms are not necessarily signs of brain metastases. But it is important to contact your doctor if you experience any of them.
Some people with metastatic brain tumors don't show any symptoms. However, over time, the brain metastases will continue to grow, eventually causing symptoms.
"
Mid-Menstrual Cycle Pain (Mittelschmerz),
Middle-Ear Infection (Otitis Media),"The most common symptoms of a middle-ear infection are pain and decreased hearing. Inside the middle ear, three tiny bones (ossicles) normally transfer sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear, where they are turned into nerve impulses that your brain understands as sound. In people with otitis media, however, inflammation and infection may change this normal process. Other symptoms can include fever, headache, general body discomfort, rubbing or pulling of the ears in children, vomiting and diarrhea in infants, dizziness, loss of balance, and fluid draining from the ear.
"
Migraine,"A migraine usually is a throbbing headache that occurs on one or both sides of the head. The headache typically is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite. Activity, bright light, or loud noises can make the headache worse, so someone having a migraine often seeks out a cool, dark, quiet place. Most migraines last from four to 12 hours, although they can be shorter or much longer. One unique feature of migraines is an unusual sensation that a migraine is about to occur. This sensation is called a prodrome. Prodrome symptoms can include fatigue, hunger, and nervousness. Migraines also have typical aftereffects, such as a feeling of exhaustion that lasts a day or two after a severe migraine headache has faded. Not all people who get migraines have prodromes or aftereffects.
Another unique feature of migraines is an aura. In a typical aura, a person suddenly will develop blurry or distorted vision or will see pulsating lights. These changes in vision will come and go over 15 to 30 minutes and alert someone that a headache is about to begin. Sometimes, auras affect the sense of hearing, smell, or taste. Only some people who get migraines have auras, and they don't accompany every headache. An aura also can occur without being followed by a headache. Rarely, migraines can cause unusual neurological symptoms such as dizziness, loss of vision, passing out, numbness, weakness, or tingling.
Migraines can be triggered by certain activities, foods, smells, or emotions. Some people are more likely to experience migraines when they are under stress, while others develop migraines when stress is relieved (for example, the day after exams or an important meeting). Women who have migraines often find that their headaches occur or worsen around the time of their menstrual periods.
"
Miscarriage,
Mitral Valve Prolapse,"Most people with mitral valve prolapse do not have any symptoms, and the condition is discovered only when a doctor hears a certain clicking sound with or without a heart murmur during a routine physical examination. In the past, mitral valve prolapse was blamed for symptoms such as chest pains, palpitations and lightheadedness. Although a person with mitral valve prolapse can also have these types of symptoms, mitral valve prolapse is not the cause.
People who have mitral regurgitation that continues to get worse can have symptoms of congestive heart failure (fatigue, shortness of breath, leg swelling).
"
Molar Pregnancy,
Moles (Nevi),"Moles can vary in color. They can be flesh-colored, yellow-brown or dark brown. They also can be flat or raised and can be smooth, hairy or warty. Although moles usually are harmless, in some cases they can become cancerous, causing a potentially deadly tumor called malignant melanoma. For this reason, it is important to monitor moles and have them examined by a dermatologist if they:
Moles called atypical moles, or dysplastic nevi, have somewhat different physical characteristics and sometimes run in families. They are more likely than common moles to turn into cancer. People with multiple dysplastic nevi and melanoma in two or more first-degree relatives have 25 times the risk of developing melanoma. This is called the dysplastic nevus-melanoma syndrome.
"
Molluscum Contagiosum,
Morton's Neuroma,
MRSA Skin Infection,"In cellulitis, the affected skin feels warm and is usually red, swollen, and painful. The redness can be slight or can stand out dramatically compared to the surrounding skin. The area of warmth can be felt with the back of the hand, especially when compared to surrounding skin. There may be a spreading network of red streaks in the skin, caused by infection in the vessels that carry lymph (tissue fluid), as well as enlarged lymph nodes (swollen glands) near the area of infection.

If you have blisters or pus on the surface of your skin rash, the cellulitis is more likely to be caused by MRSA.
Fever and a general feeling of sickness (malaise) often accompany cellulitis. Severe infections can cause abnormally low blood pressure if bacteria get into the bloodstream.
"
Multiple Myeloma,
Multiple Sclerosis,
Mumps,"In about 15% to 20% of patients, mumps does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they usually begin 14 to 18 days after exposure to someone with a mumps infection.
In about half of patients, symptoms of mumps infection may include fever, headache, sore throat, muscle aches, poor appetite and malaise (a general feeling of sickness). The mumps virus causes pain and swelling in front of the earlobe, called parotitis. Because of the pain of parotitis, chewing and swallowing may be very uncomfortable, and the patient may not feel like eating.
Infrequently, male teenagers and adults with mumps can develop swelling and pain in one or both testes (orchitis). In women, the ovaries may be involved, which can cause lower abdominal pain.
In patients of either sex, but more commonly in adults than in children, there also may be more serious complications including:
"
Muscle Strain,"Symptoms of muscle strain include:
"
Muscular Dystrophy,
Myasthenia Gravis,
Myelodysplastic Syndromes,
Myocarditis,
Myositis,
Nabothian Cysts,
Nail Trauma,
Narcolepsy,
Nasal Polyps,"The key symptoms of nasal polyps are:
"
Nausea,"Nausea is difficult for many people to describe. It is a very uncomfortable, but not painful, feeling that is felt in the back of the throat, the chest, or the upper abdomen. The feeling is associated with distaste for food or an urge to vomit. When the body prepares to vomit, the following sequence may occur:
When a person vomits, the stomach contents are expelled through the esophagus and mouth.
As a result of these body actions, when you have nausea you experience retching. Retching is repeated rhythmic contractions of respiratory and abdominal muscles that occur without your control. You may or may not vomit. Profuse sweating sometimes accompanies nausea.
"
Nearsightedness (Myopia),
Nephrectomy,
Neuroblastoma,
Neurofibromatosis,
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,
Nosebleed (Epistaxis),"Nosebleeds usually involve one nostril, but occasionally both nostrils are involved. If one nostril becomes partially blocked with a blood clot, the blood might flow out the other nostril or down the back of the throat. In a posterior nosebleed (higher up in the nose), large amounts of blood typically flow down the back of the throat. The amount of bleeding from a nosebleed can vary with posterior bleeds usually bleeding significantly more.
"
Obesity,"The primary warning sign of obesity is an above-average body weight. If you are obese, you may also experience:
Obesity increases your risk for:
"
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD),"The two defining symptoms of OCD are obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions. The symptoms are bad enough to be time-consuming, cause functional impairment or be significantly distressing.
Obsessions are persistent, repeated, anxiety-provoking or distressing thoughts that intrude into a person's consciousness. Obsessions vary and can relate to any kind of fear. Here are some common ones:
Often, an adult with OCD will recognize that the obsessive thoughts are not realistic and will try to ignore them or suppress them. Temporary relief may come by performing a compulsive action.
Compulsions are persistent, repetitive behaviors or mental acts. The goal is to reduce the anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts. The compulsions are not realistically connected to the source of anxiety. Examples include:
Anyone may feel compelled to recheck a locked door or wash hands to assure cleanliness. By themselves, such behaviors do not mean a person has OCD.
In OCD, the obsessions and compulsions are excessive and distressing. They are time-consuming, sometimes eating up several hours each day. They may interfere with personal relationships, as well as performance at work or school. Some compulsions may cause physical injury. For example, compulsive hand washing can lead to chapped hands and dermatitis, while excessive tooth brushing can cause torn, bleeding gums.
"
Onycholysis,"A nail that has lifted from its bed at its end can have an irregular border between the pink portion of the nail and the white outside edge of the nail. A greater portion of the nail is opaque, either whitened or discolored to yellow or green. Depending on the cause of onycholysis, the nail may have collected thickened skin underneath the edge of its nail plate, and the nail plate may have a deformed shape with pits or indentations in the nail surface, a bent nail edge or coarse thickening of the nail.
"
Optic Nerve Swelling (Papilledema),"Symptoms related to papilledema caused by increased pressure include headache and nausea with vomiting and a machinery-like sound. Twenty-five percent of people with advanced severe papilledema also will develop some visual symptoms. Typically, the visual changes are recurring brief episodes lasting less than 30 seconds in which the vision turns gray or black, sometimes described as if a veil has fallen over the eyes. The symptoms usually affect both eyes at once.
Visual blackouts often are triggered by a change in position, such as by standing up very suddenly, or they may be triggered by coughing or straining in the chest or abdomen. Occasionally, people with papilledema can have an experience of flashing lights, often seen in an arc shape. Other visual changes occur over time, including a smaller field of vision with a larger blind spot and, ultimately, blindness, if successful treatment is not given.
"
Oral Cancer,
Osgood-Schlatter Disease,"Symptoms of Osgood-Schlatter disease include:
The pain from Osgood-Schlatter disease can be a mild pain that lasts only while playing sports, or it can be a constant pain that severely limits regular participation in athletic activities. Pain can occur during stair climbing, kneeling, squatting or kicking. Pain usually appears in only one knee, although in about 20% to 30% of cases, both knees are affected.
"
Osteoarthritis,"Symptoms of osteoarthritis include:
People who have osteoarthritis often complain of a deep ache, centered in the joint. Typically, the pain is aggravated by using the joint and relieved by rest. However, as the disease worsens, the pain becomes more constant. Often, when the pain is significant during the night, it interferes with sleep.
"
Osteoporosis,"Most people with osteoporosis do not have any symptoms. They do not know they have osteoporosis until they have a bone density test or a fracture.
One early sign can be a loss of height caused by curvature or compression of the spine. Curvature or compression is caused by weakened vertebrae (spine bones). The weakened vertebrae develop tiny breaks called compression fractures.
Compression fractures cause the spine bones to collapse vertically. When this happens, the vertebrae become shorter. The shape of each single vertebra goes from a normal rectangle to a more triangular form.
Compression fractures can cause back pain or aching. But the loss of height usually does not cause any symptoms.

Osteoporosis usually does not cause pain unless a bone is fractured.
"
Osteosarcoma,
Ovarian Cancer,
Paget's Disease of Bone,
Pain,"Pain is the symptom. Acute pain often has a clear source and may be described as  sharp, radiating, stabbing or boring. Chronic pain is more persistent, lasting months or years, and it may or may not have an obvious source and more often described as throbbing or aching. In some cases, it is accompanied by numbness or tingling.
"
Painful Sexual Intercourse (Dyspareunia),"Women with dyspareunia may feel superficial pain at the entrance of the vagina, or deeper pain during penetration or thrusting of the penis. Some women also may experience severe tightening of the vaginal muscles during penetration, a condition called vaginismus.
"
Pancreatic Cancer,
Pancreatitis Overview,"The most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is upper abdominal pain. It can range from tolerable to severe.
Once the pain begins, it quickly reaches its maximum intensity, often within 30 minutes. In alcohol-induced pancreatitis, the pain tends to begin one to three days after a binge.
It may be difficult to find a comfortable position. Bending over or lying on your side may reduce the pain. Eating usually makes the pain worse.
Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis include
In severe cases, fever, difficulty breathing, weakness, and shock may develop.
The symptoms of chronic pancreatitis are similar but usually less severe. The pain can occur daily or off and on, and can be mild or intense. As the disease gets worse and more of the pancreas is destroyed, pain may actually become less severe. During an attack, the pain often is made worse by drinking alcohol or eating a large meal high in fats.
Because a damaged pancreas can't produce important digestive enzymes, people with chronic pancreatitis may develop problems with digesting and absorbing food and nutrients. This can lead to weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, diarrhea, and greasy, foul-smelling stools. Over time, a damaged pancreas can also fail to produce enough insulin, which results in diabetes.
"
Panic Disorders,"A panic attack is defined by having at least four of the following symptoms:
Between panic attacks, someone with panic disorder usually has persistent worries that a new attack will occur. These worries may cause the person to dramatically change his or her behavior or lifestyle to avoid the embarrassment of ""losing control"" while with other people.
"
Parathyroid Cancer,
Parkinson's Disease,"PD usually begins as a slight tremor or stiffness. It occurs in the arm or leg on one side of the body. The tremor is most obvious at rest. It is regular, typically occurring three to six times per second.
The PD tremor:
Usually worsens under stress
Improves when the arm or leg is moved voluntarily
May disappear entirely during sleep
At first, PD may be evident only as a tremor involving the thumb and index finger. It looks as if the person is manipulating a small object.
As the illness worsens, tremors may become more widespread. They eventually affect limbs on both sides of the body. Handwriting may become small, shaky and eventually illegible.
PD often causes stiffness or rigidity in the arms or legs. In addition, there is a slowing of body movements, called bradykinesia.
Rigidity and bradykinesia can be the most disabling aspects of the disease. They can impair the person's ability to walk. They can make it difficult to perform daily activities. These may include washing, dressing or using utensils.
Problems with unsteady balance and posture may make it hard to sit down in a chair, or to rise from one. Walking is accomplished with small, shuffling steps and a stooped posture.
Bradykinesia can affect the facial muscles. It can decrease spontaneous facial expressions and normal eye blinking.
Other symptoms of PD may include:
Depression
Anxiety
Disturbed sleep
Memory loss
Slurred or abnormally soft speech
Difficulty chewing or swallowing
Constipation
Impaired bladder control
Abnormal regulation of body temperature
Sexual dysfunction
Cramps, numbness, tingling or pain in the muscles
"
Paronychia,"An acute paronychia causes throbbing pain, redness, warmth and swelling in the skin around a nail. In some cases, a small collection of pus forms under the skin next to the nail, or underneath the nail itself. Often, only one nail is affected.
A chronic paronychia usually causes less dramatic symptoms than an acute paronychia. Typically, the area around the nail is tender, red and mildly swollen; the cuticle is missing; and the skin around the nail feels moist or ""boggy."" Several nails on the same hand may be affected at the same time.
"
Partial Seizures (Focal Seizures),
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID),
Perforated Eardrum,"Symptoms of a perforated eardrum include:
The level of hearing loss depends on the size of the perforation and what caused it. Trauma to the ear or head can injure the middle ear, inner ear or both, and can cause severe hearing loss. If an explosion has torn the eardrum, you may have ringing in your ears (tinnitus) for several days, as well as hearing loss. If the perforated eardrum becomes infected, the hearing loss may worsen.
"
Pericarditis,"The classic symptoms of acute pericarditis are chest pain and fever. This chest pain can be either brief and sharp or steady and constricting. It is usually under the breastbone, but it also can spread to the neck or shoulders. In many patients, chest pain becomes more severe if they take a deep breath, swallow, cough, or lie down. Sitting up or leaning forward may relieve the pain.
Patients with cardiac tamponade can have low blood pressure and shortness of breath. Patients with constrictive pericarditis also can have breathing difficulties, together with edema (swelling) of the ankles, legs and abdomen.
"
Peripheral Arterial Disease,"The most common symptom of peripheral arterial disease is intermittent claudication – pain or cramping in the legs or buttocks that starts when you exercise and goes away when you rest. Often the pain is described as a deep ache, especially in the calf muscle. The pain may extend to the foot or up toward the thigh and buttock. Sometimes, there is just numbness in the leg or a sense that one leg gets tired when you walk. A foot or toes also may feel cold or numb.
If the arteries are severely narrowed, you could experience leg pain at rest, when you are not exercising. If blood flow stops completely (usually because a blood clot forms in the narrowed vessel), parts of the leg may become pale or turn blue, feel stone cold to the touch and eventually develop gangrene.
"
Peritonsillar Abscess,"Symptoms include:
"
Pertussis (Whooping Cough),"On average, symptoms begin about 7 to 10 days after the pertussis bacteria enter your body. Initial symptoms usually resemble the common cold. Other symptoms may include:
Infants under 6 months of age, adolescents and adults may have a cough that lasts many weeks without the characteristic whooping sound. If you have a cough that lasts more than a week without improvement, contact your doctor.
"
Phenylketonuria (PKU),
Phimosis and Paraphimosis,
Phobia,
Pink eye (Conjunctivitis),
Pituitary Tumors,
Pityriasis Rosea,"The main symptoms of pityriasis rosea are the appearance of the herald patch followed by a more diffuse rash of smaller patches. The patches tend to be oval, scaly, and dry to the touch. They may be pink, red or brown and generally appear on the abdomen, back, neck, arms and legs. Only rarely do the patches appear on the face.
Usually there are no other symptoms. However, some people experience itching that can be intense.
"
Plantar Fasciitis,"Symptoms of plantar fasciitis can occur suddenly or gradually. When they occur suddenly, there is usually intense heel pain on taking the first morning steps, known as first-step pain. This heel pain will often subside as you begin to walk around, but it may return in the late afternoon or evening. When symptoms occur gradually, a more long-lasting form of heel pain will cause you to shorten your stride while running or walking. You also may shift your weight toward the front of the foot, away from the heel.
"
Pleurisy And Pleural Effusion,"Pleurisy typically causes a sharp chest pain (pleuritic chest pain) that worsens with breathing in or coughing. The pain may start and remain in one specific area of the chest wall, or it may spread to the shoulder or back. To ease chest pain from pleurisy, a person with pleurisy often lies on the affected side as a way of limiting movement of the chest wall. In rare cases, the chest pain of pleurisy is a fairly constant, dull ache.
Depending on the specific cause of pleurisy, other symptoms may be present. For example, a person with pneumonia may have a high fever, shortness of breath and a cough that produces thick, yellow or dark sputum (mucus). A pulmonary embolus may be associated with shortness of breath, a low-grade fever and a cough that brings up small amounts of blood. A person with lung cancer may have unexplained weight loss and cough.
"
Pneumoconiosis,"Pneumoconiosis sometimes does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms develop, they can include:
If pneumoconiosis causes severe lung fibrosis, breathing can become extremely difficult. When this happens, the patient's lips and fingernails may have a bluish tinge. In very advanced disease, there also may be signs of leg swelling caused by too much strain on the heart.
"
Pneumonia,
Pneumothorax,"Symptoms of a collapsed lung include:
"
Polyarteritis Nodosa,"In most people, polyarteritis nodosa develops gradually over weeks to months. The first symptoms include fever, weight loss, weakness, a generally sick feeling (called malaise), muscle aches, headaches or abdominal pain. These complaints are called nonspecific, because many illnesses and diseases produce the same symptoms. Eventually, these symptoms are followed by specific signs of arterial damage to one or more organs. Depending on the location and severity of the damage, any of the following symptoms can occur:
Because polyarteritis nodosa can cause such a wide variety of symptoms, no two people experience it in exactly the same way.  And it can be difficult to diagnose quickly.
"
Polychondritis,
Polycystic Kidney Disease,
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"Polycystic ovary syndrome usually does not cause symptoms before mid-puberty, when the ovaries begin to produce hormones in significant amounts. Women then can have some or all of the following symptoms:
"
Polymyalgia Rheumatica,"Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica tend to start suddenly and may include:
The pain and stiffness tends to be worse in the morning.
"
Post-Polio Syndrome,"Major symptoms include muscle weakness, pain, fatigue and, in some cases, wasting (atrophy) of the muscles that were involved during the polio infection, typically the legs. Additional problems can include intolerance to heat or cold, and difficulty swallowing, talking, breathing or sleeping. The syndrome also can cause abnormal muscle contractions, such as quivering or spasms, in small segments of a muscle. Worsening disability may cause social and psychological problems.
"
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,
Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) Injuries,
Postpartum Depression,
Pre-Diabetes,"Pre-diabetes is often called a ""silent"" condition because it usually has no symptoms. You can have pre-diabetes for several years without knowing it. Certain risk factors increase the chance that you have pre-diabetes. These risk factors include:
If you have one or more of these risk factors, your doctor may recommend a blood sugar test. An abnormal result is likely to be the first sign that you have pre-diabetes.
"
Preeclampsia And Eclampsia,"A woman with mild preeclampsia may not notice any symptoms, or she may have only mild swelling of the hands or feet. However, most pregnant women have some degree of swelling of the feet. So not all swelling indicates preeclampsia.
Symptoms of severe preeclampsia can include
When preeclampsia is severe it may progress to cause seizures. Most often they are generalized seizures, causing a woman to lose consciousness and have jerking movements of the arms and legs. She also may lose control of her bladder or bowels.
Severe preeclampsia also increases a woman's risk of stroke during pregnancy. This risk persists even after delivery but can be minimized by good blood pressure control.
"
Premature Ejaculation,"The key symptoms of premature ejaculation include:
"
Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS),
Presbyopia,"Presbyopia causes the following symptoms:
"
Priapism,"Symptoms of priapism include:
A painful erection that lasts longer than to four to six hours and is not relieved by orgasm
A partial erection that lasts longer than several days, even if it is not painful
"
Prostate Cancer,"In its early stages, prostate cancer rarely causes symptoms. In fact, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer have no symptoms. Doctors suspect prostate cancer if a blood test shows high levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). However, if the cancer spreads to the bladder or presses on the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body, it can cause:
If prostate cancer spreads to the lymph nodes, bones, or other organs, it can cause
"
Pseudogout (CPPD),
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis causes skin scaling and inflammation. It may or may not cause itching. There are several types of psoriasis:
About half of people with skin symptoms of psoriasis also have abnormal fingernails. Their nails are often thick and have small indentations, called pitting.
A type of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis affects some people with psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis may occur before skin changes appear and is more likely to develop in people with nail pitting.
"
Psoriatic Arthritis,"Symptoms include:
Psoriatic arthritis can affect other parts of the body. For example, fatigue and anemia are common in people with active psoriatic arthritis. Frequently, the arthritis is accompanied by inflammation of tendons and the spots where tendons attach to bones, such as in the heel or fingers.
"
Pubic Lice Or Crab Lice,"Crab lice usually cause intense itching, due mainly to an allergic reaction to the saliva of the louse. There also may be tiny red or blue marks where the insect has been biting, and the eggs, or nits, may be seen attached to the pubic hair close to the skin. Sometimes, more severe reactions occur, such as the development of pustules or intense skin reactions where the insects have been feeding. Scratching the area may cause skin infection. Crab lice, themselves, do not transmit infections.
"
Pyelonephritis,
Rash,"Although rash is easily recognized, all rashes are not the same. Rashes vary in their appearance, timing, location or distribution, and duration. In general, rashes can be described as:
Additional signs and symptoms that sometimes accompany rashes include:
"
Raynaud's Phenomenon,
Reactive Arthritis,"Symptoms usually appear within a few weeks after someone has had chlamydia or a diarrheal infection. Most people feel a little tired and have a slight fever, although a few have high fever, significant fatigue and weight loss. Other early symptoms include muscle aches, joint stiffness, and low back pain radiating into the buttocks or thighs. Back discomfort usually gets worse when you sit or lie still and gets better when you move around. Arthritis begins abruptly and usually affects one or several joints, especially the knees, ankles, feet or wrists. People often have pain at the back of an ankle or tenderness on the bottom of a heel (from inflammation at the spot where a tendon attaches to a bone).
Symptoms vary depending on what other areas of the body are inflamed:
Other symptoms are rarer, including inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), bladder (cystitis) or heart lining (pericarditis) and leaking of the aortic valve.
"
Rectocele,"A small rectocele may not cause any symptoms, especially if it bulges less than 2 centimeters (less than 1 inch) into the vagina. However, larger rectoceles can trigger a variety of rectal and vaginal complaints, including
In some cases, the patient must use a technique called manual evacuation or digitation to help empty the rectum. In this technique, the patient presses on the rectocele with her fingers while defecating to help the stool to pass.
"
Respiratory Syncytial Virus,
Restless Legs Syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome causes a wide range of uncomfortable leg sensations, which may be described as any of the following: tingling, prickly, wormy, boring, crawling, pulling, drawing, and sometimes pain. Although the muscles of the lower legs are affected most often, restless legs syndrome occasionally can cause symptoms in the arms as well. The discomfort of restless legs syndrome is almost always accompanied by an irresistible need to move the legs. Leg movement, such as walking, stretching and deep knee bends, seems to bring temporary relief. A leg massage or a warm bath also may help.
In addition to leg discomfort, restless legs syndrome also can cause periodic jerking leg movements during sleep. These involuntary leg movements often disturb both the patient and the patient's bed partner. Also, because symptoms of restless legs syndrome tend to be worse at bedtime, people with restless legs syndrome may find it hard to fall asleep and to stay asleep. This can cause insomnia and severe daytime drowsiness that may interfere significantly with work, school and social life.
"
Retinal Vessel Occlusion,"The usual symptom of retinal artery occlusion is a sudden, painless, persistent, substantial loss of vision in one eye. In about 10% of those affected, this loss of vision is preceded by one or more episodes of a condition called amaurosis fugax. Amaurosis fugax is a temporary episode of decreased vision, usually lasting no more than 10 to 15 minutes, that is sometimes described as ""closing a curtain"" on one eye.
Although retinal vein occlusion also causes painless loss of vision, this vision loss sometimes develops gradually over several days or weeks rather than suddenly. Also, depending on the extent of retinal damage, some people have only minimal blurring of vision, while others have more substantial vision loss.
"
Retinoblastoma,
Retinopathy,"Retinopathy of prematurity — There are no outward physical signs. Only an experienced ophthalmologist can find signs of this illness.
Diabetic retinopathy— Symptoms may not be noticed until the late stages of the illness. Symptoms can include:
Hypertensive retinopathy— There are often no symptoms. Some people complain of blurred vision.
Central serous retinopathy— Symptoms include:
"
Retrobulbar Neuritis,
Retrograde Ejaculation,"Normally, a healthy adult male ejaculates one-half to one teaspoonful of semen during orgasm, but the amount varies widely. In men with retrograde ejaculation, the amount of semen is decreased dramatically or there is a dry climax (orgasm without semen).
"
Reye Syndrome,"Symptoms can include
In infants, the symptoms of Reye syndrome may not follow this typical pattern. For example, infants with Reye syndrome do not always vomit.
"
Rhabdomyosarcoma,
Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Symptoms include:
Other symptoms depend on whether other parts of the body are involved. For example, for those with lung involvement, shortness of breath is common.
"
Ringworm (Tinea),
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever,"Typically, symptoms begin 2 to 14 days after a tick bite, with an average of 1 week. During the first 3 days of symptoms, an infected person usually has a fever of more than 102 degrees Fahrenheit and a severe headache. Muscle aches, nausea and vomiting are common. Between the 3rd and 5th day of fever, most people develop a rash, which usually begins on the wrists and ankles, then spreads to the arms, legs and trunk. In about two-thirds of patients, the rash also involves the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. On day 6 or later, the areas of rash may show tiny broken blood vessels and small hemorrhages under the skin.
Other symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever include:
"
Rosacea,
Rotator Cuff Injury,"Rotator cuff injuries cause pain in your shoulder and upper arm. The pain may be most noticeable when you reach up or out. When you turn your arm as you lift it, the tendons are more likely to rub against surrounding structures. For this reason your shoulder symptoms may be worst when you try to comb your hair or slip your arm into a sleeve. You also may have dull, aching shoulder pain at night.
Rotator cuff tears that affect a significant portion of the tendon cause weakness of the shoulder, limiting your ability to hold your arm out to one side or to lift an object. Difficulty using the shoulder because of pain does not always mean that there is a tear. Rotator cuff injuries cause pain in your shoulder and upper arm.

"
Salivary Gland Disorders,"Symptoms vary, depending on the specific type of salivary gland disorder:
These symptoms are followed by swelling in the parotid glands, usually on both sides of the face. It may difficult to fully open the mouth.
"
Sarcoidosis,
Scarlet Fever,"Scarlet fever usually is triggered by a strep throat infection, which causes the following symptoms:
Within 12 to 48 hours after these symptoms appear, the typical scarlet fever rash begins.
The scarlet fever rash is as bright red as sunburn, and it often has a fine texture like sandpaper (andquot;sandpaper rash"") or gooseflesh (goosebumps). It usually starts in the underarm area, groin and neck, then spreads to the trunk, back, arms and legs. Other symptoms of scarlet fever include:
Occasionally, scarlet fever follows a streptococcal skin infection, such as an infection of burns or wounds, or impetigo. When this happens, the rash and related skin symptoms appear, but there are no symptoms related to strep throat.
"
Schizophrenia,
Schizotypal Personality Disorder,
Sciatica,
Scleritis,
Scleroderma,
Scoliosis,"Normally, when you look at a person's spine from the front or back, it appears straight. When a person has scoliosis, the spine typically curves out to one side and then back again, or, more commonly, has two bowed-out areas that balance each other, resembling an S shape. Other signs can include
Most people with scoliosis are not bothered by it other than abnormal posture and cosmetic concerns. If scoliosis is severe and untreated, it can cause additional problems, including:
"
"Screening for Birth Defects in Early Pregnancy (Combined Test, Integrated Test, and Quadruple Test)",
Sebaceous Cysts,
Seborrheic Dermatitis,"In infants, seborrheic dermatitis appears as a scaly redness that usually is not itchy or uncomfortable. In some babies, it affects only the scalp (cradle cap), but in others, it also involves the neck creases, armpits or groin.
In adults and adolescents, seborrheic dermatitis may affect only the scalp, appearing as either patchy or diffuse areas of redness and flaking. Other skin areas commonly affected include the eyebrows, eyelids, forehead, nose creases, outer ear, chest, underarms, or groin. Although some adults and adolescents feel an itchy or burning irritation in areas of seborrheic dermatitis, others don't have any discomfort. In some people, seborrheic dermatitis flare-ups are triggered by stress.
"
Seborrheic Keratoses,"Seborrheic keratoses look like crusty growths on the skin that typically start out tan or brown but can darken over time. They tend to have a greasy appearance and look as though they were glued onto the skin, as opposed to growing from it. They may be tiny, or larger than 3 inches across. They rarely itch.
"
Secondary Hypertension,"New guidelines define high blood pressure as persistent readings of 130/80 mm Hg. However, people with secondary hypertension will be diagnosed when they have readings of at least 14/90 mm Hg. Most often doctors start to consider secondary hypertension when blood pressure is not controlled with two or three different medications or if the person has symptoms related to the underlying condition.
For example, a tumor of the adrenal gland called a pheochromocytoma can cause sweating, palpitations, severe anxiety and weight loss. In Cushing's syndrome, there may be weight gain, weakness, abnormal growth of body hair and loss of menstrual periods in women, and the appearance of purple ""stretch marks"" on the abdomen (abdominal striae). Hyperparathyroidism with elevated calcium levels can cause fatigue, increased urination, constipation and kidney stones. Hyperaldosteronism often causes weakness related to low blood potassium levels.
"
"Sedative, Hypnotic or Anxiolytic Drug Use Disorder","Symptoms of dependence on sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drugs:
There is no absolute dose or number of pills per day that indicates a person is dependent on sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drugs. People with drug dependence eventually develop physical tolerance (the gradual need for greater amounts of the drug to feel the same effects). But addiction implies that the person is also craving the drug's effect or relying on the drug for a reason other than the intended therapeutic uses of the drug.
If the person suddenly stops taking the drug, the body's accustomed internal environment changes drastically, causing symptoms of withdrawal: anxiety, tremors, nightmares, insomnia, poor appetite, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, blood pressure abnormalities, dangerously high fever and seizures. With short-acting medications — pentobarbital (Nembutal), secobarbital (Seconal), alprazolam (Xanax), meprobamate (Miltown, Equanil), methaqualone (Quaalude) — withdrawal symptoms begin 12 to 24 hours after the last dose and peak at 24 to 72 hours. With longer-acting medications — phenobarbital, diazepam (Valium), or chlordiazepoxide (Librium) — withdrawal symptoms begin 24 to 48 hours after the last dose and peak within 5 to 8 days.
As with alcohol, sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drugs can cause symptoms during intoxication. These symptoms can include slurred speech, problems with coordination or walking, inattention, and memory difficulties. In extreme cases, the person may lapse into a stupor or coma.
"
Seizure Overview,
Sexually Transmitted Diseases (Overview),
Shigellosis,"Although health experts don't know why, some people take in Shigella bacteria without becoming ill. Others develop only a brief fever, or a brief fever with mild diarrhea that goes away on its own. About 25% of patients, however, develop high fever, abdominal cramping and severe diarrhea that can contain blood, mucus and pus. These people can have 10 to 30 bowel movements each day, along with a persistent urge to have a bowel movement.
Rarely, Shigella bacteria can affect other parts of the body far from the digestive tract. When this happens, there may be a rash, joint pain, confusion and/or kidney failure.
"
Shin Splints,"Shin splints cause muscle pain and tenderness along the inner side of the lower shin. These symptoms tend to affect about 2 to 6 inches of muscle and tendon in the shin area. Pain usually continues after exercise ends, and you may even feel it when you are resting and not putting weight on the affected leg.
"
Shingles (Herpes Zoster),
Shoulder Dislocation,"Symptoms of a dislocated shoulder include:
"
Shoulder Sprain,"If you have a Grade I acromioclavicular sprain, you will have slight swelling and tenderness at the outside tip of your collarbone. You will have mild pain when you move your arm or shrug your shoulder. In more severe acromioclavicular joint sprains, swelling will distort the normal contour of your joint and the area will be very tender. You will feel significant pain when you try to move your arm, or when your doctor or athletic trainer touches the joint while examining it.
Symptoms of sternoclavicular sprains are similar to those of acromioclavicular sprains, except swelling and tenderness are located near the midline of the chest.
"
Sick Sinus Syndrome,"Most of the time, sick sinus syndrome doesn't cause any symptoms. When it does cause symptoms, they are very vague and can be attributed to many other disorders. Therefore, it is very hard to diagnose sick sinus syndrome just on the basis of symptoms.
Symptoms may include:
Over the long term, sick sinus syndrome can increase your risk for stroke and heart failure. Injuries can occur if you fall during a fainting episode.
"
Sickle Cell Anemia,"Symptoms of sickle cell anemia include:
When sickled red cells block blood vessels, the oxygen supply to body cells is obstructed. This causes painful episodes called crises. Painful sickle cell crises can affect many different joints and organs. The back, chest, extremities and abdomen are affected most commonly. The level of pain varies, from trivial to excruciating. The episodes typically last from two to seven days.
In about half the cases, the pain crisis is accompanied by:
These painful episodes can be triggered by many things. Triggers include:
Women are more likely to experience a painful episode during their menstrual period.
But the majority of sickle cell crises have no identifiable cause.
"
Sjogren's Syndrome,
Skin Tags (Acrochordon),"A skin tag at first may appear as a tiny soft bump on the skin. Over time, it grows into a flesh-colored piece of skin attached to the skin surface by a stalk. It's easy to move or wiggle a skin tag back and forth. A skin tag is painless, although it can become irritated if it is rubbed a lot.
If a skin tag is twisted on its stalk, a blood clot can develop within it and the skin tag may become painful.
"
Sleep Apnea,"Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include excessive sleepiness during waking hours. Loud snoring is another symptom, and the person's bed partner may be the first to notice this problem. Morning headache and dry mouth can occur. Obesity is common, though not all people with sleep apnea are overweight.
"
Sleepwalking and Sleep Terrors,
Small Cell Lung Cancer,
Smallpox,
Soft Tissue Sarcoma,
Somatic Symptom Disorder,"Symptoms usually occur over many years. The person may be distressed and function poorly at work and at home. Medical evaluation does not explain the symptoms, or the symptoms may exceed what would be expected in any medical illness that is found. Pain is the most common symptom. Symptoms can appear in almost any part of the body.
"
Sore Throat (Pharyngitis),"The main symptom of pharyngitis is a sore throat and pain with swallowing. In infectious pharyngitis, other symptoms vary depending on whether the infection is viral or bacterial (usually strep throat):
Children may have diarrhea.
Some viruses cause painful sores in and around the mouth, including the lips.
Children also can have nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
Because symptoms of viral and bacterial pharyngitis can overlap, it may be difficult for the doctor to distinguish between them based on symptoms alone. As a general rule, if you have a prominent cough and nasal symptoms you are more likely to have viral pharyngitis than strep throat.
In addition to viral and bacterial pharyngitis, an infection with fungi (Candidaor ""yeast"") sometimes can cause throat pain, difficulty swallowing and white patches inside the mouth. This throat infection, commonly called thrush, usually affects infants and people with weakened immune systems.
A sore throat that lasts for more than a couple of weeks may be caused by acid reflux from the stomach, breathing through the mouth in a dry environment, postnasal drip or, rarely, a tumor.
"
Spider Veins,"Red or bluish-purple blood vessels appear, usually on the legs or thighs, but sometimes on the face, forearms or hands. Spider veins usually do not cause any symptoms, but rarely may cause a mild dull discomfort or burning sensation.
"
Spina Bifida,
Spinal Cord Trauma,"The symptoms of spinal cord trauma vary and depend on the location and severity of the injury. Complete spinal cord trauma -- an injury that results in a total loss of sensation or the ability to move -- occurs at about the same level as the injury. For example, a person injured in the middle of the neck will lack feeling and be unable to move below the middle of the neck. Almost one-half of all spinal cord injuries are complete. Complete injuries that take place in the upper neck can compromise breathing ability and require the person to use a mechanical ventilator. Injuries to the spinal cord in the neck or upper back may cause abnormalities in blood pressure, sweating and in regulating body temperature. In addition, loss of bladder and bowel control and increased muscle tone in the extremities (spasticity) may accompany spinal cord injury. Some of these symptoms may not be apparent immediately after the injury.
Injuries to a specific side of the spinal cord or its center will produce characteristic patterns of symptoms, such as weakness or paralysis of arms or legs, or one side of the body. In an injured person who is unconscious, the degree of neurological injury may be hard to assess, so doctors must have a high degree of suspicion that a spinal cord injury has taken place and take steps to protect the spinal cord. This usually is done by using a cervical collar to immobilize the neck or by strapping the person to a stiff backboard for transport.
"
Spinal Cord Tumors,"Spinal cord tumors generally develop slowly and worsen over time. They can cause many symptoms depending upon their location. Symptoms arise as the tumor presses on the spinal cord or the nerves that exit it. Tumors also may restrict the flow of blood to the spinal cord. Common symptoms include:
The part of the body affected by the symptoms will vary depending on the tumor's location on the spinal cord. In general, symptoms occur in parts of the body that are at the same level as or lower than the tumor.
"
Sprain (Overview),
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung,"Early on, squamous cell lung cancer may have no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include:
If the cancer has spread beyond the lungs, it can cause other symptoms. For example, you may have bone pain if it has spread to your bones, or headaches and seizures if it has spread to your brain.
Many of these symptoms can be caused by other conditions. See your doctor if you have symptoms so that the problem can be diagnosed and properly treated.
"
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin,
Stomach Cancer,
Stuttering,
Styes And Chalazions,"A sty or chalazion begins as a tender red lump or bump within the eyelid at the base of the eyelash. It may cause tearing, light sensitivity and the sensation of having something in the eye. Swelling usually involves only a small area of the lid, but in some cases it can lead to irritation and redness of the whole eyelid.
A small, yellowish spot eventually appears in the center of a sty, when the pus collection expands to become visible just beneath the skin or eyelid surface. Pain usually is relieved when the sty ruptures, draining the pus through an opening in the skin, the lid margin or the undersurface of the lid.
A chalazion at first may be red and swollen for a few days, but eventually it changes to a painless, slowly growing, round mass in the lid. The skin around this firm rubbery lump can be moved loosely over the swelling.

"
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"The symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage can include:
If you have only a small subarachnoid hemorrhage, you may have several of these symptoms, particularly a severe headache that starts suddenly. However, your symptoms may improve on their own. This can be a critical warning sign, called a sentinel headache. People who have a small subarachnoid hemorrhage may have a second hemorrhage within the next week if they do not get medical treatment.
In the several days that follow a subarachnoid hemorrhage, it is possible to develop more typical symptoms of a stroke, from damage of specific areas of the brain. Examples of these symptoms include:
"
Subdural Hematoma,"Acute subdural hemorrhage usually develops after severe head trauma. Injuries that result in this condition are typically forceful enough to cause a temporary loss of consciousness.
Usually, in the minutes to hours after head injury, the person recovers consciousness. Then, the person gradually loses consciousness again, this time from subdural bleeding.
Other common symptoms of an acute subdural hemorrhage include
Chronic subdural hemorrhages produce more subtle symptoms. These symptoms may continue for more than a month before the diagnosis is recognized.
These symptoms include
The symptoms caused by chronic subdural hemorrhage can mimic other common conditions. For example, they may resemble strokes and brain tumors. Occasionally, the gradual memory loss and personality changes can be mistaken for dementia.
"
Sun Allergy (Photosensitivity),
Sun-Damaged Skin,"Sun-damaged skin shows the following symptoms:
"
Superficial Thrombophlebitis,"Thrombophlebitis causes pain in the area of the clotted vein, together with redness and sometimes swelling in the surrounding skin.
"
Swallowed Object,"If the object gets caught in the esophagus, it can cause:
Objects also can become trapped in the intestine or can tear the intestinal walls. The result can be vomiting, abdominal pain, abnormal bowel sounds and dark stools that contain blood.
"
Swimmer's Ear (Otitis Externa),"Symptoms of swimmer's ear include:
"
Syphilis,
Tachycardia,"Tachycardia can be part of the body's normal response to anxiety, fever, rapid blood loss or strenuous exercise. It also can be caused by medical problems, such as an abnormally high level of thyroid hormones, called hyperthyroidism. In some people, tachycardia is the result of a cardiac arrhythmia (a heart-generated abnormality of heart rate or rhythm). Tachycardia can also be caused by lung problems, such as pneumonia or a blood clot in one of the lung's arteries.
In other cases, tachycardia may be a side effect of caffeinated drinks, alcohol, illegal substances, or medication.
"
Takayasu's Arteritis,"The symptoms of Takayasu's arteritis vary depending on the stage of the illness and the arteries affected. Early symptoms can include fever, fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss, night sweats, joint pain, and chest pain. Later symptoms typically are related to narrowing of the arteries and a decrease in blood flow to certain organs. These later symptoms can include:
"
Tay-Sachs Disease,
Tear Duct Infection (Dacryocystitis),
Telogen Effluvium,
Tendonitis,"In general, tendonitis causes pain in the tissues surrounding a joint, especially after the joint is used too much during play or work. In some cases, the joint may feel weak, and the area may be red, swollen and warm to the touch.
When tendonitis is caused by an infection such as gonorrhea, there may be other symptoms, including rash, fever, or a discharge from the vagina or penis.
Other symptoms vary according to which tendon is affected:
"
Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis),"Tennis elbow causes pain, tenderness and sometimes swelling of the elbow and forearm on the affected side. The pain may worsen if the person attempts any activity that stresses the painful tendons, such as lifting heavy objects or even just shaking hands.
"
Tension Headache,"The main symptom of a tension headache is a sense of tightness around the head. This is sometimes described as a ""tight hat-band"" or ""vise"" sensation.
Neck and shoulder muscles are often tense and sore to the touch. The person may have trouble concentrating and difficulty sleeping.
A person can have both migraine and tension-type headaches. And the symptoms of tension-type headaches and migraine headaches can overlap. For example, both types of headaches may be made worse by bright lights or loud noises. In general, migraine headaches tend to be throbbing. Tension-type headaches cause a more constant pain. But the pain of a migraine or tension-type headache can be steady or throbbing or alternate between the two.

"
Testicular Cancer,
Testicular Torsion,
Tetanus,
Throat Cancer (Larynx and Pharynx),
Thrombocytopenia,"People with severe thrombocytopenia may have abnormal bleeding almost anywhere in the body.
Symptoms can include:
"
Thromboembolism (Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism),
Thrombotic Stroke,"The symptoms of a thrombotic stroke vary, depending on which area of the brain is affected. That is because different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions. For example, different areas of the brain control movement, sight, speech, balance and coordination.
Symptoms can include:
If any of these symptoms appear suddenly, you may be having a thrombotic stroke or any other kind of stroke. Symptoms, once they begin, can quickly become less prominent, stay the same or gradually get worse over hours or days.
Often, brief episodes of stroke-like symptoms occur before a stroke. A short episode of stroke-like symptoms is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Symptoms appear suddenly and then get better over several minutes to a couple hours.  Most TIAs last less than 30 minutes. One or more of these attacks occurs before more than half of all strokes.
"
Thyroid Cancer,
Tick Bites,"Most tick bites do not cause any symptoms. However, the following symptoms can develop as a reaction to tick secretions:
Skin reactions include:
Tick paralysis is relatively rare. Paralysis begins in the feet and legs and gradually works its way to the upper body, arms and head over a period of hours or days. Once the tick is removed, a person with tick paralysis will recover completely. If the tick is not removed, the person can die if the muscles that control breathing are paralyzed.
Symptoms associated with tick-borne infections differ depending on the type of infection. Common symptoms are as follows:

Human monocytic ehrlichiosis– Symptoms ranging from mild to severe can involve many organ systems. Common symptoms include high fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, weight loss and a spotted rash. Patients with weak immune systems can develop a fatal, overwhelming infection. Breathing difficulties and mental changes may also occur.
Anaplasmosis– Symptoms ranging from mild to severe include high fever, headache, a general sick feeling (malaise), achy muscles (myalgia), nausea, vomiting, cough, stiff neck and confusion. Less than 10% of people with this disease will develop a rash.
Colorado tick fever– Flulike symptoms include fever and chills, severe headache, achy muscles (myalgia), stiff neck, light intolerance and, in some cases, a spotted rash.
Babesiosis– Many people will not have any symptoms. Others develop fatigue, fever, drenching sweats, nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle aches, joint aches and jaundice. Patients with suppressed immune systems may develop severe disease.
Tularemia– The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Some people do not have any symptoms, but this disease also can be severe, causing septic shock and death. Common symptoms include fever, chills, headache and a general sick feeling (malaise). Many people also develop a single, red ulcerated lump with a central scab and tender, swollen lymph nodes in the area. A small number of patients develop pneumonia.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever– Symptoms include fever, headache, a spotted rash on wrists and ankles, and a patchy rash on arms and legs. Muscle aches (myalgia), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are also common.
"
Tics,
Tinea Versicolor,
Tinnitus,"Tinnitus is a symptom in itself. However, people who have tinnitus also may have the following:
In addition, depending on the cause of tinnitus, there also may be
"
Toenail Fungus (Onychomycosis),"When a toenail develops a fungal infection, it typically turns yellow or brown. It becomes thick and overgrown. Foul-smelling debris also may accumulate under the nail.
As the infection continues, the nail may crumble gradually and fall off.  Or, it may become so thick that the affected toe feels uncomfortable or painful inside shoes.
A less common variety of toenail fungus is called white superficial onychomycosis. The nail turns white rather than yellow or brown. The surface becomes soft, dry, and powdery.
"
Torn Meniscus,"The symptoms of a torn meniscus can include:
"
Torsional Deformity,"Childhood torsional deformities usually are painless. The child usually does not notice the problem, and it typically does not interfere with the child's ability to walk, run, and play normally.
"
Tourette Syndrome,
Toxic Shock Syndrome,
Toxoplasmosis,
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA),
Traumatic Dislocation of the Hip,"In an accident victim, a traumatic hip dislocation can cause the following symptoms:
"
Traveler's Diarrhea,"Most episodes of traveler's diarrhea occur in the first or second week of the trip. Symptoms vary depending on what organism causes the problem. People have at least three loose stools per day and often a lot more. They also may experience fatigue, decreased appetite, abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Usually there is no blood in the stool (feces).
"
Trichomoniasis,"In women,Trichomonasorganisms can live in the vagina for many years without causing symptoms. If symptoms occur, they can include:
In rare cases there will be discomfort in the lower abdomen. Symptoms may be worse during a menstrual period. Although men usually have no symptoms, they occasionally can have irritation and inflammation at the tip of the penis, discomfort during urination, and a discharge from the end of the penis.
"
Trigeminal Neuralgia (Tic Douloureux),
Tropical Sprue,
Tuberculosis,"Most people infected with tuberculosis have inactive disease that does not cause any symptoms. In these people, a skin test for tuberculosis (called a PPD skin test, for ""protein purified derivative"") will show positive results within three months of getting the infection. Once a PPD is positive, it usually will remain positive throughout life.
Among people with active tuberculosis, symptoms vary according to the type of disease:
There usually is also a cough, which eventually produces discolored mucus. As the illness progresses, people may cough up blood (sometimes in large amounts), become short of breath and ultimately develop severe breathing problems.
Although the bacteria are spread throughout the body, there may not be any other symptoms. But if there are, they can occur nearly anywhere. Some of the more common symptoms are:
"
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,"Initial Symptoms
Symptoms usually come on suddenly and strongly. Typically the most prominent symptoms are excessive urination and extreme thirst. This is because the increased glucose in the blood causes the kidneys to create more urine than usual. Losing more fluid in the urine makes a person dehydrated. And dehydration leads to great thirst. Children may start to wet the bed again.
Weight loss, with no loss of appetite, also is common. The weight loss is due in part to dehydration. Water has weight.  Imagine holding a gallon jug of water: it weighs about eight pounds. People with new, uncontrolled type 1 diabetes can lose a gallon of water from dehydration.
Other common symptoms are weakness, fatigue, confusion, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms can be caused both by dehydration and by a condition called ketoacidosis.
Ketoacidosis occurs because cells can't use the glucose they need for energy. So the cells have to use something else. In response to low insulin levels, the liver produces an alternative fuel called ketones. Ketones are a kind of acid. When they build up in the blood, it's called ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis can cause heart problems and affect the nervous system. Within hours, it may put a person at risk of coma or death.
Even after it is diagnosed and treatment is begun, type 1 diabetes can affect all body systems. It is less likely to damage the body, and cause symptoms, if the blood sugar levels are well controlled by treatment.
The serious and potentially life-threatening complications that can occur with type 1 diabetes include:
Hypoglycemia can lead to coma if it is not corrected by eating or drinking carbohydrates. Glucagon is a substance that makes the liver release glucose into the bloodstream. An injection of glucagon can also correct hypoglycemia.
"
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,
Ulcerative Colitis,"The symptoms of ulcerative colitis vary. Some people with the disease have a burst of symptoms every few months. Others have symptoms all the time. Some, fortunately, have symptoms only rarely.
Typical symptoms include
Ulcerative colitis also may cause
"
Undescended Testicle,"There is usually only one sign that a boy has an undescended testicle. The scrotum appears underdeveloped or smaller on the affected side. In rare cases, the undescended testicle can become twisted (testicular torsion), causing severe groin pain. If this happens, seek medical attention immediately.
"
Urethritis,
Urinalysis,
Urinary Health,"The symptoms of specific conditions involving the urinary tract vary depending on the condition.
"
Urinary Incontinence,
Urinary Tract Infection in Men,
Uterine And Bladder Prolapse,"Mild cases of bladder or uterine prolapse usually don't cause any symptoms. A prolapse that is more advanced can cause any of the following symptoms:
"
Uterine Cancer,
Uveitis,
Vaginal Atrophy (Atrophic Vaginitis),
Vaginal Cancer,
Vaginal Discharge,"You may notice a change in the color, amount or odor of discharge. A white, curd-like discharge that looks like cottage cheese is a classic sign of yeast infection. Yellow, green or gray discharge is usually a sign of trichomonas or bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis also has an unusual, fishy odor.
Itching is usually most noticeable with a yeast infection, though it may occur with any type of infection or irritation. A dry, irritated vaginal lining, which may be particularly uncomfortable or painful during intercourse, is usually a more prominent symptom of atrophic vaginitis. A new vaginal discharge accompanied by fever, abdominal pain or pain during intercourse may indicate a sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. However, gonorrhea and chlamydia usually don't cause any symptoms at all.
"
Vaginal Yeast Infection,"The symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection include:
"
Vaginitis,"Bacterial vaginosis — Bacterial vaginosis causes an abnormal grayish-white vaginal discharge with a foul-smelling vaginal odor.
Candida vaginitis —Candida vaginitis can cause the following symptoms:
Trichomonas —In women, Trichomonas organisms can live in the vagina for many years without causing any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they can include:
Symptoms can be worse during a menstrual period.
"
Varicose Veins,"In the legs, varicose veins commonly are found along the inside of the leg, at the ankles and at the back of the calf. The affected veins look blue, swollen or stretched out, kinked or twisted.
A dull ache in the legsIn some people, varicose veins do not cause any symptoms. However, other people may experience one or more of the following:
In more severe cases of chronic venous insufficiency, a slowing of blood flow through the vein can lead to localized skin changes, including dryness, a rash or brownish discoloration and open sores (ulcers). Slow blood flow also can cause a clot to form inside the affected vein. This condition is called thrombosis.
In general, symptoms of varicose veins are worse at the end of the day, especially after periods of prolonged standing. Some women also find that their symptoms are more intense during the days before their menstrual periods, and during pregnancy.
"
Vascular Birthmarks,"Vascular birthmarks are painless and usually don't cause any symptoms other than the skin discoloration.
A hemangioma may cause other symptoms if its location interferes with a vital organ. For example, a lesion on the neck could press down on the trachea and interfere with breathing, and a hemangioma near the eye or on the ear could limit vision or affect hearing.
In rare cases, a port-wine stain is associated with other abnormalities. For example, some children who have a stain around the eyelids also have Sturge-Weber syndrome, a condition that is associated with glaucoma, seizures and other problems.
"
Vasculitis Overview,"Symptoms vary depending on the specific type of vasculitis:
"
Vertigo,
Vitamin B12 Deficiency,"Symptoms tend to develop slowly and may not be recognized immediately. As the condition worsens, common symptoms include:
If low levels of B12remain for a long time, the condition also can lead to irreversible damage to nerve cells, which can cause the following symptoms:
"
Vitiligo,
Vocal Cord Disorders,
Vulvar Cancer,
Waldenström Macroglobulinemia,
Warts,"The two types of warts seen most often are common warts and plantar warts.

Plantar wartsappear on the bottom (sole) of the foot. They are flattened by the pressure of standing on them and can be dotted with tiny, clotted blood vessels that look like dark pinpoints. Plantar warts often are painful, especially when they're on a weight-bearing part of the foot. Plantar warts may require vigorous, repeated treatment before they go away.

Other types of warts include:
Genital wartsappear on and near the genitals of men and women, as well as inside the vagina and on the cervix in women.
Cervical wartsappear on the cervix and sometimes develop into cervical cancer.
Mosaic wartsappear on the feet. They are groups of many small, closely set plantar warts.
Filiform wartsappear on the eyelids, face, neck or lips. They are long, narrow growths that usually grow straight out from the skin.
Flat wartsappear on the face and along scratch marks. They are smooth, flat-topped, yellow-brown papules and are more common in children than in adults.
Pedunculated wartsappear on the head and neck, scalp and beard and are shaped like cauliflower.
Diagnosis
A doctor usually can diagnose warts by looking at them. Sometimes, the doctor will have to take some tissue from a wart and analyze it under a microscope. An HPV test can also be performed on samples taken from the cervix during a woman's pelvic exam.
"
Wrist Sprain,"In a mild wrist sprain, your wrist may be slightly swollen and tender, and you probably will feel some mild pain when you move it.
In more severe sprains, swelling can change the shape of your wrist, and you may have some bruising (a black-and-blue skin discoloration). Also, you'll probably feel significant pain when you try to move your wrist, or when your health care professional moves your wrist while examining it.
