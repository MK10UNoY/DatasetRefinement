Fractured clavicle in the newborn,"The baby will not move the painful, injured arm. Instead, the baby will hold it still against the side of the body. Lifting the baby under the arms causes the child pain. Sometimes, the fracture can be felt with the fingers, but the problem often can't be seen or felt.; Within a few weeks, a hard lump may develop where the bone is healing. This lump may be the only sign that the newborn had a broken collar bone."

They may include:; Types of craniosynostosis are:; No ""soft spot"" (fontanelle) on the newborn's skull; A raised hard ridge along the affected sutures; Unusual head shape; Slow or no increase in the head size over time as the baby grows; Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly) is the most common type. It affects the main suture on the very top of the head. The early closing forces the head to grow long and narrow, instead of wide. Babies with this type tend to have a broad forehead. It is more common in boys than girls.; Frontal plagiocephaly is the next most common type. It affects the suture that runs from ear to ear on the top of the head. It usually occurs on just one side, causing a flattened forehead, raised eyebrow, and prominent ear on that side. The baby's nose may also appear to be pulled toward that side. This is more common in girls than in boys.; Metopic synostosis is a rare form that affects the suture close to the forehead. The child's head shape may be described as trigonocephaly, because the top of the head appears triangular, with a narrow or pointed forehead. It may range from mild to severe."

In most cases, they recover much more quickly and have only a few poxes (fewer than 30). These cases are often harder to diagnose. However, these children can still spread chickenpox to others.; Fever; Headache; Stomach ache; The blisters are most often first seen on the face, middle of the body, or scalp.; After a day or two, the blisters become cloudy and then scab. Meanwhile, new blisters form in groups. They often appear in the mouth, in the vagina, and on the eyelids.; Children with skin problems, such as eczema, may get thousands of blisters."

Diastasis recti,"A diastasis recti looks like a ridge, which runs down the middle of the belly area. It stretches from the bottom of the breastbone to the belly button. It increases with muscle straining.; In infants, the condition is most easily seen when the baby tries to sit up. When the infant is relaxed, you can often feel the edges of the rectus muscles.; Diastasis recti is commonly seen in women who have multiple pregnancies. This is because the muscles have been stretched many times. Extra skin and soft tissue in the front of the abdominal wall may be the only signs of this condition in early pregnancy. In the later part of pregnancy, the top of the pregnant uterus can be seen bulging out of the abdominal wall. An outline of parts of the unborn baby may be seen in some severe cases."

Lead poisoning,"There are many possible symptoms of lead poisoning. Lead can affect many different parts of the body. A single high dose of lead can cause severe emergency symptoms.; However, it is more common for lead poisoning to occur slowly over time. This results from repeated exposure to small amounts of lead. In this case, there may not be any obvious symptoms. Over time, even low levels of lead exposure can harm a child's mental development. The health problems get worse as the level of lead in the blood gets higher.; Lead is much more harmful to children than adults because it can affect children's developing nerves and brains. The younger the child, the more harmful lead can be. Unborn children are the most vulnerable.; Possible complications include:; The symptoms of lead poisoning may include:; Very high levels of lead may cause vomiting, internal bleeding, staggering walk, muscle weakness, seizures, or coma.; Behavior or attention problems; Failure at school; Hearing problems; Kidney damage; Reduced IQ; Slowed body growth; Abdominal pain and cramping (usually the first sign of a high, toxic dose of lead); Aggressive behavior; Anemia (low red blood cell count); Constipation; Difficulty getting pregnant; Difficulty sleeping; Headaches; Hearing loss; Irritability; Loss of previous developmental skills (in young children); Low appetite and energy; Reduced sensations"
Mercuric chloride poisoning,"Symptoms of mercuric chloride poisoning include:; Abdominal pain (severe); Breathing difficulty (severe); Decreased urine output (may stop completely); Diarrhea (bloody); Drooling; Metallic taste; Mouth lesions (sores); Pain in the throat and mouth (severe); Shock (extremely low blood pressure); Swelling in the throat (may result in throat closure and inability to breathe); Vomiting, including blood"
Mercuric oxide poisoning,"Symptoms of mercuric oxide poisoning include:; Abdominal pain (severe); Breathing difficulty (severe); Bloody diarrhea; Decreased urine output (may stop completely); Drooling; Metallic taste in the mouth; Mouth soresÂ (ulcers); Throat swelling (swelling may cause throat to close); Shock (extremely low blood pressure); Vomiting, including blood"
Mercury poisoning,"ELEMENTAL MERCURY; Elemental mercury is usually harmless if it is touched or swallowed. It is so thick and slippery that it usually falls off the skin or leaves the stomach and intestines without being absorbed.; A lot of damage can occur, though, if elemental mercury gets into the air in the form of small droplets that are breathed into the lungs. This often occurs by mistake when people try to vacuum up mercury that has spilled onto the ground.; Breathing in enough elemental mercury will cause symptoms right away. These are called acute symptoms. Long-term symptoms will occur if small amounts are inhaled over time. These are called chronic symptoms. Chronic symptoms may include:; Depending on how much mercury is inhaled, permanent lung damage and death may occur. Long-term brain damage from inhaled elemental mercury can also occur.; There have been cases of mercury being injected under the skin, which can cause fever and rash. Infection may develop, requiring surgical drainage and removal of the mercury.; INORGANIC MERCURY; Unlike elemental mercury, inorganic mercury is usually poisonous when swallowed. Depending on how much is swallowed, symptoms may include:; If inorganic mercury enters your bloodstream, it can attack the kidneys and brain. Permanent kidney damage and kidney failure may occur. A large amount in the bloodstream may cause massive blood and fluid loss from diarrhea and kidney failure, leading to death.; ORGANIC MERCURY; Organic mercury can cause sickness if it is breathed in, eaten, or placed on the skin over long periods of time. Usually, organic mercury causes problems over years or decades, not right away. This means that being exposed to small amounts of organic mercury every day for years will likely cause symptoms to appear later. A single large exposure, however, can also cause problems.; Long-term exposure will likely cause symptoms in the nervous system, including:; Being exposed to large amounts of the organic mercury called methylmercury while pregnant may cause permanent brain damage in the baby. Most health care providers recommend eating less fish, especially high-mercury fish such as swordfish, while pregnant, and limiting the consumption of such fish by small children as well. Women should talk to their provider about what they should and should not eat while pregnant.; Metallic taste in the mouth; Vomiting; Difficulty breathing; Bad cough; Swollen, bleeding gums; Burning in the stomach and throat; Bloody diarrhea and vomiting; Numbness or pain in certain parts of your skin; Uncontrollable shaking or tremor; Inability to walk well; Blindness and double vision; Memory problems; Seizures and death (with large exposures)"

Cobalt poisoning,"Usually you have to be exposed to high levels of cobalt for weeks to months to have symptoms. However, it is possible to have some symptoms if you swallow a large amount of cobalt at one time.; The most worrisome form of cobalt poisoning occurs when you breathe it into your lungs. This usually will only happen in industrial settings where large amounts of drilling, polishing, or other processes release fine particles containing cobalt into the air. Breathing in this cobalt dust can lead to chronic lung problems. If you breathe in this substance for long periods, you will likely develop breathing problems that are similar to asthma or pulmonary fibrosis, such as shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance.; Cobalt poisoning that occurs from prolonged constant with your skin will likely cause irritation and rashes that go away slowly.; Swallowing a large amount of absorbable cobalt at one time is very rare and is likely not very dangerous.
