Recently, through the use of genomics scientists have found that these forms of histiocytosis show gene changes (mutations) in early white blood cells. This leads to abnormal behavior in the cells. The abnormal cells then increase in various parts of body including the bones, skin, lungs, and other areas.; Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder that can affect people of all ages. The highest rate is among children ages 5 to 10. Some forms of the disorder are genetic, which means they are inherited.; Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare form of histiocytosis affecting mainly adults that involves multiple parts of the body."

They are different, but they do have some of the same symptoms. Most people get a cold several times a year. In contrast, people generally get the flu only once every few years. Cold symptoms tend to be more mild compared to the flu and COVID-19. The flu and COVID-19 share many symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. The best way to know is to get tested. COVID-19 self-tests are available over-the-counter at most pharmacies. If needed, your health care provider can test you for the flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory infections.; The flu spreads easily.

Symptoms include shortness of breath or feeling tired after little effort.; Poor sleep quality; Sleep apnea; Daytime sleepiness; Depression; Headaches; Tiredness,"The exact cause of OHS is not known. It is believed that OHS results from a defect in the brain's control over breathing. Excess weight against the chest wall also makes it harder for the muscles to draw in a deep breath and to breathe quickly enough. This worsens the brain's breathing control. As a result, the blood contains too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen.; During stable conditions, people are not acidemic as the kidneys have enough time to correct the acidity caused by the high carbon dioxide."

This can result from air pressure changes such as when scuba diving or traveling to a high altitude.; Tall, thin people and smokers are more at risk for a collapsed lung.; Lung diseases can also increase the chance of getting a collapsed lung. These include:; In some cases, a collapsed lung occurs without any cause. This is called a spontaneous collapsed lung or spontaneous pneumothorax.; Asthma; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Cystic fibrosis; Tuberculosis; Whooping cough"
000088,Psittacosis,Ornithosis; Parrot pneumonia,The incubation period of psittacosis is 5 to 15 days.

It is caused by a defective gene that makes the body produce abnormally thick and sticky fluid, called mucus. This mucus builds up in the breathing passages of the lungs and in the pancreas.; The buildup of mucus results in life-threatening lung infections and serious digestion problems. The disease may also affect the sweat glands and a man's reproductive system.; Many people carry a CF gene, but do not have symptoms. This is because for a person to get CF, they must inherit 2 defective genes, 1 from each parent. Some Americans have the CF gene. It is more common among those of northern or central European descent.; Most children with CF are diagnosed by age 2, especially as newborn screening is performed across the United States.

Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body.; When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension.; The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger and malfunction. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale.; Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by:; In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known.

Symptoms you may have are:; Fainting spells during activity; Chest discomfort, usually in the front of the chest; Chest pain; Swelling of the feet or ankles; Symptoms of lung disorders, such as wheezing or coughing or phlegm production; Bluish lips and fingers (cyanosis)","High blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries of the lungs is called pulmonary hypertension. It is the most common cause of cor pulmonale.; In people who have pulmonary hypertension, changes in the small blood vessels inside the lungs can lead to increased blood pressure in the right side of the heart. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the lungs. If this high pressure continues, it puts a strain on the right side of the heart. That strain can cause cor pulmonale.; Lung conditions that cause a low blood oxygen level in the blood over a long time can also lead to cor pulmonale. Some of these are:; Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Chronic blood clots in the lungs; Cystic fibrosis (CF); Severe bronchiectasisÂ; Scarring of the lung tissue (interstitial lung disease); Severe curving of the upper part of the spine (kyphoscoliosis); Obstructive sleep apnea, which causes stops in breathing during sleep; Idiopathic (no specific cause) tightening (constriction) of the blood vessels of the lungs, also called primary pulmonary hypertension; Severe left-sided heart failure"

The most common blood clot is one in a deep vein of the thigh or in the pelvis (hip area). This type of clot is called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The blood clot breaks off and travels to the lungs where it lodges.; Less common causes of a pulmonary embolus include air bubbles, fat droplets, amniotic fluid, or clumps of parasites or tumor cells.; You are more likely to get a pulmonary embolus if you or your family has a history of blood clots or certain clotting disorders. A pulmonary embolus may occur:; Disorders that may lead to blood clots include:; After childbirth; During a hospital stay when you may be at bedrest or immobilized; After severe injuries, burns, or fractures of the hips or thigh bone; After surgery, most commonly bone, joint, or brain surgery; During or after a long plane or car ride; If you have cancer; If you take birth control pills or estrogen therapy; Long-term bed rest or staying in one position for a long time; Diseases of the immune system that make it harder for the blood to clot.; Inherited disorders that make the blood more likely to clot. One such disorder is antithrombin III deficiency."
000133,Acute mountain sickness,High altitude cerebral edema; Altitude anoxia; Altitude sickness; Mountain sickness; High altitude pulmonary edema,"Your symptoms will also depend on the speed of your climb and how hard you push (exert) yourself. Symptoms range from mild to life-threatening. They can affect the nervous system, lungs, muscles, and heart.; In most cases, symptoms are mild. Symptoms of mild to moderate acute mountain sickness may include:; Symptoms that may occur with more severe acute mountain sickness include the following and may progress to high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude cerebral edema:; Difficulty sleeping; Dizziness or lightheadedness; Fatigue; Headache; Loss of appetite; Nausea or vomiting; Rapid pulse (heart rate); Shortness of breath with exertion; Blue color to the skin (cyanosis); Chest tightness or congestion; Confusion; Cough; Coughing up blood; Decreased consciousness or withdrawal from social interaction; Gray or pale complexion; Inability to walk in a straight line, or walk at all; Shortness of breath at rest","Acute mountain sickness is caused by reduced air pressure and lower oxygen levels at high altitudes.; The faster you climb to a high altitude, the more likely you will get acute mountain sickness.; The best way to prevent altitude illness is to ascend gradually. It is a good idea to spend a few days ascending to 9850 feet (3000 meters). Above this point ascend very slowly so that the elevation at which you sleep does not increase more than 990 feet to 1640 feet (300m to 500m) per night.; You are at higher risk for acute mountain sickness if:; You live at or near sea level and travel to a high altitude.; You have had the illness before.; You ascend quickly.; You have not acclimatized appropriately to the altitude.; Alcohol or other substances have interfered with acclimatization.; You have medical problems involving the heart, nervous system, or lungs.; If you have anemia"
000134,Silicosis,Acute silicosis; Chronic silicosis; Accelerated silicosis; Progressive massive fibrosis; Conglomerate silicosis; Silicoproteinosis,Symptoms include:; Cough; Shortness of breath; Weight loss,"Silica is a common, naturally-occurring crystal. It is found in most rock beds. Silica dust forms during mining, quarrying, tunneling, and working with certain metal ores. Silica is a main part of sand, so glass workers and sand-blasters are also exposed to silica.; Three types of silicosis occur:; People who work in jobs where they are exposed to silica dust are at risk. These jobs include:; Intense exposure to silica can cause disease within a year. ButÂ it usually takes at least 10 years of exposure before symptoms occur. Silicosis has become less common since the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) created regulations requiring the use of protective equipment, which limits the amount of silica dust workers inhale.; Chronic silicosis results from long-term exposure (more than 20 years) to low amounts of silica dust. The silica dust causes swelling in the lungs and chest lymph nodes. This disease may cause people to have trouble breathing. This is the most common form of silicosis.; Accelerated silicosis occurs after exposure to larger amounts of silica over a shorter period of time (3 to 10 years). Swelling in the lungs and symptoms occur faster than in simple silicosis.; Acute silicosis results from short-term exposure to very large amounts of silica. The lungs become very inflamed and can fill with fluid, causing severe shortness of breath and a low blood oxygen level.; Abrasives manufacturing; Glass manufacturing; Mining; Quarrying; Road and building construction; Sand blasting; Stone cutting"
000135,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,Formerly: Wegener's granulomatosis,"Frequent sinusitis and bloody noses are the most common symptoms. Other early symptoms include a fever that has no clear cause, night sweats, fatigue, and a general ill feeling (malaise).; Other common symptoms may include:; Less common symptoms include:; Chronic ear infections; Pain, and sores around the opening of the nose; Cough with or without blood in the sputum; Chest pain and shortness of breath as the disease progresses; Loss of appetite and weight loss; Skin changes such as bruises and ulcers of the skin; Kidney problems; Bloody urine; Eye problems ranging from mild conjunctivitis to severe swelling of the eye; Joint pain; Weakness; Abdominal pain","GPA mainly causes inflammation of blood vessels in the lungs, kidneys, nose, sinuses, and ears. This is called vasculitis or angiitis. Other areas may also be affected in some cases. The disease can be fatal and prompt treatment is important.; In most cases, the exact cause is not known, but it is an autoimmune disorder. Rarely, vasculitis with positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) has been caused by several drugs including cocaine cut with levamisole, hydralazine, propylthiouracil, and minocycline.; GPA is most common in middle-aged adults of northern European descent. It is rare in children."
000137,Rheumatoid pneumoconiosis,RP; Caplan syndrome; Pneumoconiosis - rheumatoid; Silicosis - rheumatoid pneumoconiosis; Coal worker's pneumoconiosis - rheumatoid pneumoconiosis,Symptoms of RP are:; Cough; Joint swelling and pain; Lumps under the skin (rheumatoid nodules); Shortness of breath; Wheezing,"RP is caused by breathing in inorganic dust. This is dust that comes from grinding metals, minerals, or rock. After the dust enters the lungs, it causes inflammation. This can lead to the formation of many small lumps in the lungs and an airway disease similar to mild asthma.; It is not clear how RP develops. There are two theories:; When people breathe in inorganic dust, it affects their immune system and leads to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks healthy body tissue by mistake.; When people who already have RA or are at high risk for it are exposed to mineral dust, they develop RP."
000139,Parapneumonic pleural effusion,Pleural effusion - pneumonia,"Symptoms can include any of the following:; Chest pain, usually a sharp pain that is worse with cough or deep breaths; Cough with sputum; Fever; Rapid breathing; Shortness of breath","Pneumonia, most commonly from bacteria, causes parapneumonic pleural effusion."

When the heart is not able to pump efficiently, blood can back up into the blood vessels that take blood through the lungs.; As the pressure in these blood vessels increases, fluid is pushed into the air spaces (alveoli) in the lungs. This fluid reduces normal oxygen movement through the lungs. These two factors combine to cause shortness of breath.; Congestive heart failure that leads to pulmonary edema may be caused by:; Pulmonary edema may also be caused by:; Heart attack, or any disease of the heart that weakens or stiffens the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy); Leaking or narrowed heart valves (mitral or aortic valves); Sudden, severe high blood pressure (hypertension); Certain medicines; High altitude exposure; Kidney failure; Narrowed arteries that bring blood to the kidneys; Lung damage caused by burns from poisonous gas inhalation or severe infection; Major injury"
000141,Asthma,Bronchial asthma; Wheezing - asthma - adults,"Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. For example, you may have symptoms all the time or mostly during physical activity.; Most people with asthma have attacks separated by symptom-free periods. Some people have long-term shortness of breath with episodes of increased shortness of breath. Wheezing or a cough may be the main symptom.; Asthma attacks can last for minutes to days. An asthma attack may start suddenly or develop slowly over several hours or days. It may become dangerous if airflow is severely blocked.; Symptoms of asthma include:; Emergency symptoms that need prompt medical help include:; Cough with or without sputum (phlegm) production; Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing (intercostal retractions); Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise or activity; Whistling sound or wheezing as you breathe; Pain or tightness in the chest; Difficulty sleeping; Abnormal breathing pattern (breathing out takes more than twice as long as breathing in); Bluish color to the lips and face (cyanosis); Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion, during an asthma attack; Extreme difficulty breathing; Rapid pulse; Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath; Sweating; Difficulty speaking; Breathing temporarily stops","Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. An asthma attack occurs when the lining of the air passages has become swollen and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This narrowing reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.; Asthma symptoms can be caused by breathing in substances called allergens or triggers, or by other causes.; Common asthma triggers include:; Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma. The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals.; Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema. Others have no history of allergies.; Animals (pet hair or dander); Dust mites; Certain medicines (aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]); Changes in weather (most often cold weather); Chemicals in the air (pollution) or in food; Physical activity; Mold; Pollen; Respiratory infections, such as the common cold and many other viruses; Strong emotions (stress); Tobacco or other inhalant that is smoked"
000142,Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease,Goodpasture syndrome; Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with pulmonary hemorrhage; Pulmonary renal syndrome; Glomerulonephritis - pulmonary hemorrhage,"Symptoms may occur very slowly over months or even years, but they often develop very quickly over days to weeks.; Loss of appetite, fatigue, and weakness are common early symptoms.; Lung symptoms may include:; Kidney and other symptoms include:; Coughing up blood; Dry cough; Shortness of breath; Bloody urine; Burning sensation when urinating; Nausea and vomiting; Pale skin; Swelling (edema) in any area of the body, especially in the legs","Anti-GBM disease is an autoimmune disorder. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. People with this syndrome develop substances that attack a protein called collagen in the tiny air sacs in the lungs and the filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidneys.; These substances are called antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies. The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies are antibodies against this membrane. They can damage the basement membrane, which can lead to kidney damage.; Sometimes, this disorder is triggered by a viral respiratory infection or by breathing in hydrocarbon solvents. In such cases, the immune system may attack organs or tissues because it mistakes them for these viruses or foreign chemicals.; The immune system's faulty response causes bleeding in the air sacs of the lungs and inflammation in the kidney's filtering units."
000143,Chemical pneumonitis,Aspiration pneumonia - chemical,Acute symptoms may include:; Chronic symptoms may include:; Air hunger (feeling that you cannot get enough air); Breathing that soundsÂ wet or gurgling (abnormal lung sounds); Cough; Difficulty breathing; Unusual sensation (possibly burning feeling) in the chest; Cough (may or may not occur); Progressive disability (related to shortness of breath); Rapid breathing (tachypnea); Shortness of breath with only mild exercise,"Many chemicals used in the home and workplace can cause pneumonitis.; Some common dangerous inhaled substances include:; There are two types of pneumonitis:; Chronic aspiration of acid from the stomach and exposure to chemical warfare can also lead to chemical pneumonitis.; Chlorine gas (breathed in from cleaning materials such as chlorine bleach, during industrial accidents, or near swimming pools); Grain and fertilizer dust; Noxious fumes from pesticides; Smoke (from house fires and wildfires); Acute pneumonitis occurs suddenly after breathing in the substance.; Long-term (chronic) pneumonitis occurs after exposure to low levels of the substance over a long time. This causes inflammation and may lead to stiffness of the lungs. As a result, the lungs start to lose their ability to get oxygen to the body. Untreated, this condition can causeÂ respiratoryÂ failure and death."
000144,Bronchiectasis,Acquired bronchiectasis; Congenital bronchiectasis; Chronic lung disease - bronchiectasis,"Symptoms develop over time. They may occur months or years after the event that causes the bronchiectasis.; Long-term (chronic) cough with large amounts of foul smelling sputum is the main symptom of bronchiectasis. Other symptoms may include:; Breath odor; Coughing up blood (less common in children); Fatigue; Paleness; Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise; Weight loss; Wheezing; Low grade fever and night sweats; Clubbing of fingers (rare, depends on cause)","Bronchiectasis is often caused by inflammation or infection of the airways that keeps coming back.; Sometimes it begins in childhood after having a severe lung infection or inhaling a foreign object. Breathing in food particles can also lead to this condition.; Other causes of bronchiectasis can include:; Cystic fibrosis, a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs; Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis,Â SjÃ¶gren syndromeÂ orÂ inflammatory bowel disease; Allergic lung diseases; Leukemia and related cancers; Immune deficiency syndromes; Primary ciliary dyskinesia (another congenital disease); Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria; As a complication of bronchiolitis obliterans; Asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease (uncommon)"
000145,Community-acquired pneumonia in adults,Bronchopneumonia; Community-acquired pneumonia; CAP,"The most common symptoms of pneumonia are:; Other symptoms include:; Cough (with some pneumonias you may cough up greenish or yellow mucus, or even bloody mucus); Fever, which may be mild or high; Shaking chills; Shortness of breath (may only occur when you climb stairs or exert yourself); Confusion, especially in older people; Excess sweating and clammy skin; Headache; Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue; Malaise (not feeling well); Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough; White nail syndrome, or leukonychia","Pneumonia is a common illness that affects millions of people each year in the United States. Germs called bacteria, viruses, and fungi may cause pneumonia. In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia.; Ways you can get pneumonia include:; Pneumonia can be caused by many types of germs.; Risk factors that increase your chance of getting pneumonia include:; Bacteria and viruses living in your nose, sinuses, or mouth may spread to your lungs.; You may breathe some of these germs directly into your lungs.; You breathe in (inhale) food, liquids, vomit, or fluids from the mouth into your lungs (aspiration pneumonia).; The most common type of bacteria is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).; Atypical pneumonia, often called walking pneumonia, is caused by other bacteria.; A fungus called Pneumocystis jirovecii can cause pneumonia in people whose immune system is not working well, especially people with advanced HIV infection.; Viruses, such as the flu virus, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19), are also common causes of pneumonia.; Chronic lung disease (COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis); Cigarette smoking; Dementia, stroke, brain injury, cerebral palsy, or other brain disorders; Immune system problem (during cancer treatment, or due to HIV/AIDS, organ transplant, or other diseases); Other serious illnesses, such as heart disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes; Recent surgery or trauma; Surgery to treat cancer of the mouth, throat, or neck"

It is caused by many different germs. Pneumonia that starts in the hospital tends to be more serious than other lung infections because:; Pneumonia occurs more often in people who are using a ventilator, which is a machine that helps them breathe. This is called ventilator-associated pneumonia.; Hospital-acquired pneumonia can also be spread by health care workers, who can pass germs from their hands, clothes, or instruments from one person to another. This is why hand-washing, wearing gowns, and using other safety measures is so important in the hospital.; People can be more likely to get pneumonia while in the hospital if they:; People in the hospital are often very sick and cannot fight off germs.; The types of germs present in a hospital are often more dangerous and more resistant to treatment than those outside in the community.; Use alcohol excessively; Have had chest surgery or other major surgery; Have a weak immune system from cancer treatment, certain medicines, or severe wounds; Have long-term (chronic) lung disease; Breathe saliva or food into their lungs as a result of not being fully alert or having swallowing problems (for example, after a stroke); Are not mentally alert due to medicines or illness; Are older; Are on a breathing machine (ventilator)"
000148,Cystic hygroma,Lymphangioma; Lymphatic malformation,"A common symptom is a neck growth. It may be found at birth, or discovered later in an infant after an upper respiratory tract infection (such as a cold).","A cystic hygroma occurs as the baby grows in the womb. It forms from pieces of material that carry fluid and white blood cells. This material is called embryonic lymphatic tissue.; After birth, a cystic hygroma most often looks like a soft bulge under the skin. The cyst may not be found at birth. It typically grows as the child grows. Sometimes it is not noticed until the child is older."
000149,Myocarditis,Inflammation - heart muscle,"There may be no symptoms. Symptoms may be similar to the flu. If symptoms occur, they may include:; Other symptoms that may occur with this disease include:; Chest pain that may resemble a heart attack; Fatigue or listlessness; Fever and other signs of infection including headache, muscle aches, sore throat, diarrhea, or rashes; Joint pain or swelling; Leg swelling; Pale, cool hands and feet (a sign of poor circulation); Rapid breathing; Rapid heart rate; Shortness of breath; Fainting, often related to irregular heart rhythms; Low urine output","Myocarditis is an uncommon disorder. Most of the time, it is caused by an infection that reaches the heart.; When you have an infection, your immune system produces special cells to fight off disease. If the infection affects your heart, the disease-fighting cells enter the heart. However, the chemicals made by these cells can also damage the heart muscle. As a result, the heart can become thick, swollen, and weak.; Many cases are caused by a virus that reaches the heart. These can include the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza (flu) virus, coxsackievirus, parvovirus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and others.; It may also be caused by bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, streptococcus, mycoplasma, and chlamydia.; Other causes of myocarditis include:; Sometimes the exact cause may not be discovered.; Reactions to certain medicines, such as certain chemotherapy medicines; Exposure to chemicals in the environment, such as heavy metals; Infections due to fungus or parasites; Radiation; Autoimmune disorders that cause inflammation throughout the body; Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination has been reported, but is very rare"

Why this occurs is unknown.
000151,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW),Preexcitation syndrome; WPW; Tachycardia - Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome; Arrhythmia - WPW; Abnormal heart rhythm - WPW; Rapid heartbeat - WPW,"How often a rapid heart rate occurs varies depending on the person. Some people with WPW syndrome have only a few episodes of rapid heart rate. Others may have the rapid heart rate once or twice a week or more. Also, there may be no symptoms at all, so that condition is found when a heart test is done for another reason.; A person with this syndrome may have:; Chest pain or chest tightness; Dizziness; Lightheadedness; Fainting; Palpitations (a sensation of feeling your heart beating, usually quickly or irregularly); Shortness of breath","Normally, electrical signals follow a certain pathway through the heart. This helps the heart beat regularly. This prevents the heart from having extra beats or beats happening too soon.; In people with WPW syndrome, some of the heart's electrical signals go down an extra pathway. This may cause a very rapid heart rate called supraventricular tachycardia.; Most people with WPW syndrome do not have any other heart problems. However, this condition has been linked with other cardiac conditions, such as Ebstein anomaly. A form of the condition also runs in families."
000155,High blood pressure - medicine-related,Hypertension - medication related; Drug-induced hypertension,,"Blood pressure is determined by the:; There are several types of high blood pressure:; Chemical substances and medicines that can cause high blood pressure include:; Rebound hypertension occurs when blood pressure rises after you stop taking or lower the dose of a drug (typically a medicine to lower high blood pressure).; Many other factors can also affect blood pressure, including:; Amount of blood the heart pumps; Condition of the heart valves; Pulse rate; Pumping power of the heart; Size and condition of the arteries; Essential hypertension has no cause that can be found (many different genetic traits contribute to essential hypertension, each one having a relatively small effect).; Secondary hypertension occurs because of another disorder.; Drug-induced hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension caused by a response to a chemical substance or medicine.; Pregnancy-induced hypertension.; Acetaminophen; Alcohol, amphetamines, ecstasy (MDMA and derivatives), and cocaine; Angiogenesis inhibitors (including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies); Antidepressants (including venlafaxine, bupropion, and desipramine); Black licorice; Caffeine (including the caffeine in coffee and energy drinks); Corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids; Ephedra and many other herbal products; Erythropoietin; Estrogens (including birth control pills); Immunosuppressants (such as cyclosporine); Many over-the-counter medicines such as cough/cold and asthma medicines, particularly when the cough/cold medicine is taken with certain antidepressants,Â such asÂ tranylcypromine or tricyclics; Migraine medicines; Nasal decongestants; Nicotine; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); Phentermine (a weight loss medicine); Testosterone and other anabolic steroids and performance-enhancing drugs; Thyroid hormone (when taken in excess); Yohimbine (and Yohimbe extract); This is common for medicines that block the sympathetic nervous system like beta blockers and clonidine.; Talk to your health care provider to see if your medicine needs to be gradually tapered before stopping.; Age; Condition of the kidneys, nervous system, or blood vessels; Genetics; Foods eaten, weight, and other body-related variables, including the amount of added sodium in processed foods; Levels of various hormones in the body; Volume of water in the body"

The clot can block blood flow and cause:; Redness of the skin; Skin that feels warm to the touch; Swelling (edema) of a leg or arm; Pain or tenderness in a leg or arm","DVT is most common in adults over age 60. But it can occur at any age. When a clot breaks off and moves through the bloodstream, it is called an embolism. An embolism can get stuck in the blood vessels in the brain, lungs, heart, or another area, leading to severe damage.; Blood clots may form when something slows or changes the flow of blood in the veins.; Risk factors include:; Blood is more likely to clot in someone who has certain problems or disorders, such as:; Sitting for long periods when traveling can increase the risk for DVT. This is most likely when you also have one or more of the risk factors listed above.; A pacemaker catheter that has been passed through a vein in the groin; Bed rest or sitting in one position for too long, such as plane or car travel; Family history of blood clots; Fractures in the pelvis or legs; Giving birth within the last 6 months; Pregnancy; Obesity; Recent surgery (most commonly hip, knee, or female pelvic surgery); Too many blood cells being made by the bone marrow, causing the blood to be thicker than normal (polycythemia vera); Having an indwelling (long-term) catheter in a blood vessel; Age greater than 60; Cancer; Certain autoimmune disorders, such as lupus; Cigarette smoking; Conditions that make it more likely to develop blood clots; Taking estrogens or birth control pills (this risk is even higher with smoking)"

They can include:; Difficulty breathing (dyspnea); Frequent respiratory infections in children; Feeling the heart beat (palpitations) in adults; Shortness of breath with activity","Normally, blood cannot flow between the two upper heart chambers. However, an ASD allows this to happen.; When blood flows between the two heart chambers, this is called a shunt. Blood most often flows from the left to the right side. When this happens the right side of the heart enlarges. Over time pressure in the lungs may build up. When this happens, the blood flowing through the defect will then go from right to left. If this occurs, there will be less oxygen in the blood that goes to the body.; Atrial septal defects are defined as primum or secundum.; Very small defects (less than 5 millimeters or Â¼ inch) are less likely to cause problems. Smaller defects are often discovered much later in life than larger ones.; Along with the size of the ASD, where the defect is located plays a role that affects blood flow and oxygen levels. The presence of other heart defects is also important.; ASD is not very common.; The primum defects are linked to other heart defects of the ventricular septum and mitral valve.; Secundum defects can be a single, small or large hole. They may also be more than one small hole in the septum or wall between the two chambers."

It can be caused by many different heart problems.; The condition may affect only the right side or only the left side of the heart. Both sides of the heart also can be involved.; Heart failure may be due to two different problems with the heart muscle:; As the heart's pumping becomes less effective, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid may build up in the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the arms and legs. This is called congestive heart failure or, more simply, just heart failure.; The most common causes of heart failure are:; Other heart problems that may cause heart failure are:; Other diseases that can cause or contribute to heart failure:; Your heart muscle cannot contract very well. This is called systolic heart failure, or heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).; Your heart muscle is stiff and does not fill up with blood easily even though pumping power is normal. This is called diastolic heart failure, or heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).; Coronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. This can weaken the heart muscle over time or suddenly.; High blood pressure that is not well controlled, leading to problems with stiffness of the heart muscle, or eventually leading to heart muscle weakening.; Congenital heart disease; Heart attack (when coronary artery disease results in a sudden blockage of a heart artery); Heart valves that are leaky or narrowed; Infection that weakens the heart muscle; Some types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias); Amyloidosis; Emphysema; Overactive thyroid; Sarcoidosis; Severe anemia; Too much iron in the body (usually due to hereditary hemochromatosis); Underactive thyroid"
000159,Coronary artery spasm,Variant angina; Angina - variant; Prinzmetal angina; Vasospastic angina; Chest pain - Prinzmetal,"Spasm may be ""silent"" (without symptoms) or it may result in chest pain or angina. If the spasm lasts long enough, it may even cause a heart attack.; The main symptom is a type of chest pain called angina. Typically, the chest pain feels like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or a crushing feeling. It may spread to the:; Some people say the pain feels like gas or indigestion. It is most often severe. The pain may spread to the neck, jaw, shoulder, or arm.; The pain of coronary artery spasm:; The person may lose consciousness.; Chest pain and shortness of breath due to coronary artery spasm are often not caused by exercise, unlike angina that is caused by hardening of the coronary arteries.; Arm (most often the left); Back; Jaw; Neck; Shoulder; Often occurs at rest; May occur at the same time each day, usually between midnight and 8:00 a.m.; Lasts from 5 to 30 minutes","The spasm often occurs in coronary arteries that have not become hardened due to plaque buildup. However, it also can occur in arteries with plaque buildup.; These spasms are due to a squeezing of muscles in the artery wall. They most often occur in just one area of the artery. The coronary artery may appear normal during testing, but it does not function normally at other times.; About 2% of people with angina (chest pain and pressure) have coronary artery spasm.; Coronary artery spasm occurs most commonly in people who smoke or who have high cholesterol or high blood pressure. It may occur without cause, or it may be triggered by:; Cocaine use and cigarette smoking can cause severe spasms of the arteries. This causes the heart to work harder. In many people, coronary artery spasm may occur without any other heart risk factors (such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol).; Alcohol withdrawal; Emotional stress; Exposure to cold; Medicines that cause narrowing of the blood vessels (vasoconstriction); Stimulant drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine"

It is often due to scar-like damage to electrical pathways in the heart muscle tissue.; In children, heart surgery on the upper chambers is a common cause of sick sinus syndrome.; Coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, and aortic and mitral valve diseases may occur with sick sinus syndrome. However, these diseases may have nothing to do with the syndrome.; Sick sinus syndrome is uncommon, but not rare. It is the most common reason people need to have an artificial pacemaker implanted. Sinus bradycardia occurs more often than the other types of the condition.; Tachycardias (rapid heart rhythms) that start in the upper chambers of the heart may be part of the syndrome. These include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia. A period of fast heart rates is often followed by very slow heart rates. When there are periods of both slow and fast heart rates (rhythms) the condition often will be called tachy-brady syndrome.; Some medicines can make abnormal heart rhythms worse, especially when doses are high. These include digitalis, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and antiarrhythmics."
000162,Abdominal aortic aneurysm,Aneurysm - aortic; AAA,"Aneurysms can develop slowly over many years, often with no symptoms. Symptoms may come on quickly if the aneurysm expands rapidly, tears open or leaks blood within the wall of the vessel (aortic dissection).; Symptoms of rupture include:; Pain in the abdomen or back.

It may spread to the groin, buttocks, or legs.; Passing out.; Clammy skin.; Dizziness.; Nausea and vomiting.; Rapid heart rate.; Shock.","The exact cause of an aneurysm is unknown. It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery. Factors that can increase your risk of having this problem include:; An abdominal aortic aneurysm is most often seen in males over age 60 who have one or more risk factors. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to break open or tear. This can be life threatening.; Smoking; High blood pressure; Male sex; Genetic factors"
000163,Hypertensive heart disease,Hypertension - hypertensive heart; High blood pressure - hypertensive heart,,"High blood pressure means the pressure inside the blood vessels (called arteries) is too high. As the heart pumps against this pressure, it must work harder. Over time, this causes the heart muscle to thicken.; Because there are often no symptoms with high blood pressure, people can have the problem without knowing it. Symptoms most often do not occur until after many years of poor blood pressure control, when damage to the heart has occurred.; Eventually, the muscle may become so thick that it does not get enough oxygen. This can cause angina (chest pain). Without appropriate blood pressure control, the heart muscle can weaken over time and heart failure may develop.; High blood pressure also leads to thickening of the blood vessel walls. When combined with cholesterol deposits in the blood vessels, the risk of heart attack and stroke increases.; Hypertensive heart disease is the leading cause of illness and death from high blood pressure."
000164,Costochondritis,Chest wall pain; Costosternal syndrome; Costosternal chondrodynia; Chest pain - costochondritis,"The most common symptoms of costochondritis are pain and tenderness in the chest. You may feel:; Sharp pain at the front of your chest wall, which may move to your back or stomach; Increased pain when you take a deep breath or cough; Tenderness when you press the area where the rib joins the breastbone; Less pain when you stop moving and breathe quietly","There is often no known cause of costochondritis. But it may be caused by:; Chest injury; Hard exercise or heavy lifting; Viral infections, such as respiratory infections; Strain from coughing; Infections after surgery or from IV drug use; Some types of arthritis"
000165,Digitalis toxicity,,"These are symptoms of digitalis toxicity:; Other symptoms may include:; Confusion; Irregular pulse; Loss of appetite; Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; Fast heartbeat; Vision changes (unusual), including blind spots, blurred vision, changes in how colors look, or seeing spots; Decreased consciousness; Decreased urine output; Difficulty breathing when lying down; Excessive nighttime urination; Overall swelling","Digitalis toxicity can be caused by high levels of digitalis in the body. A lower tolerance to the drug can also cause digitalis toxicity. People with lower tolerance may have a normal level of digitalis in their blood and still have adverse effects. People may also develop digitalis toxicity if they have other risk factors.; People with heart failure who take digoxin are commonly given medicines called diuretics. These drugs remove excess fluid from the body. Many diuretics can cause potassium loss. A low level of potassium in the body can increase the risk of digitalis toxicity. Digitalis toxicity may also develop in people who take digoxin and have a low level of magnesium in their body.; You are more likely to have this condition if you take digoxin, digitoxin, or other digitalis medicines along with drugs that interact with it. Some of these drugs are quinidine, flecainide, verapamil, and amiodarone.; If your kidneys do not work well, digitalis can build up in your body. Normally, it is removed through the urine. Any problem that affects how your kidneys work (including dehydration) makes digitalis toxicity more likely.; Some plants contain chemicals that can cause symptoms similar to digitalis toxicity if they are eaten. These include foxglove, oleander, and lily of the valley."
000166,Pericarditis - after heart attack,Dressler syndrome; Post-MI pericarditis; Post-cardiac injury syndrome; Postcardiotomy pericarditis,"Symptoms include:; Anxiety; Chest pain from the swollen pericardium rubbing on the heart. The pain may be sharp, tight or crushing and may move to the neck, shoulder, or abdomen. The pain may also be worse when you breathe and go away when you lean forward, stand, or sit up.; Trouble breathing; Dry cough; Fast heart rate (tachycardia); Fatigue; Fever (common with the second type of pericarditis); Malaise (general ill feeling); Splinting of ribs (bending over or holding the chest) with deep breathing","Two types of pericarditis can occur after a heart attack.; Early pericarditis: This form most often occurs within 1 to 3 days after a heart attack. Inflammation and swelling develop as the body tries to clean up the damaged heart tissue.; Late pericarditis: This is also called Dressler syndrome. It is also called post-cardiac injury syndrome or postcardiotomy pericarditis. It most often develops several weeks or months after a heart attack, heart surgery, or other trauma to the heart. It can also happen about a week after a heart injury. Dressler syndrome is thought to occur when the immune system attacks healthy heart tissue by mistake.; Things that put you at higher risk for pericarditis include:; A previous heart attack; Open heart surgery; Chest trauma; A heart attack that has affected the full thickness of your heart muscle"
000167,Hypovolemic shock,Shock - hypovolemic,"Symptoms may include:; The greater and more rapid the blood loss, the more severe the symptoms of shock.; Anxiety or agitation; Cool, clammy skin; Confusion; Decreased or no urine output; Generalized weakness; Pale skin color (pallor); Rapid breathing; Sweating, moist skin; Unconsciousness (lack of responsiveness)","Losing more than 15 to 20 percent of the normal amount of blood in your body causes hypovolemic shock.; Blood loss can be due to:; The amount of circulating blood in your body also may drop when you lose too much body fluid from other causes. This can be due to:; Bleeding from serious cuts; Bleeding from other injuries; Internal bleeding, such as in the gastrointestinal tract; Burns; Diarrhea; Excessive perspiration; Vomiting"
000168,Dilated cardiomyopathy,Cardiomyopathy - dilated; Primary cardiomyopathy; Diabetic cardiomyopathy; Idiopathic cardiomyopathy; Alcoholic cardiomyopathy,"Symptoms of heart failure are most common. They most often develop slowly over time. However, sometimes symptoms start very suddenly and may be severe.; Common symptoms are:; Chest pain or pressure (more likely with exercise); Cough; Fatigue, weakness, faintness; Irregular or rapid pulse; Loss of appetite; Shortness of breath with activity or after lying down (or being asleep) for a while; Swelling of feet and ankles","The most common causes of dilated cardiomyopathy are:; There are many other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, including:; This condition can affect anyone at any age. However, it is most common in adult men.; Heart disease caused by a narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries; Poorly controlled high blood pressure; Alcohol or cocaine (or other illegal drug) use (usually heavy use for a prolonged time); Diabetes, thyroid disease, or hepatitis; Medicines that can be toxic to the heart, such as certain medicines used to treat cancer; Abnormal heart rhythms in which the heart beats very fast for a long period of time; Autoimmune illnesses; Conditions that run in families; Infections that involve the heart muscle; Heart valves that are either too narrow or too leaky; During the last month of pregnancy, or within 5 months after the baby is born; Exposure to heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, cobalt, or mercury"
000169,Tricuspid regurgitation,Tricuspid insufficiency; Heart valve - tricuspid regurgitation; Valvular disease - tricuspid regurgitation,"Mild tricuspid regurgitation may not cause any symptoms. Symptoms of heart failure may occur, and can include:; Active pulsing in the neck veins; Decreased urine output; Fatigue, tiredness; General swelling; Swelling of the abdomen; Swelling of the feet and ankles; Weakness","An increase in size of the right ventricle is the most common cause of this condition. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs where it picks up oxygen. Any condition that puts extra strain on this chamber can cause it to enlarge. Examples include:; Tricuspid regurgitation may also be caused or worsened by infections, such as:; Less common causes of tricuspid regurgitation include:; Abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) which can come from a lung problem (such as COPD, or a clot that has traveled to the lungs); Other heart problem such as poor squeezing of the left side of the heart; Problem with the opening or closing of another one of the heart valves; Rheumatic fever; Infection of the tricuspid heart valve, which causes damage to the valve; A type of heart defect present at birth called Ebstein anomaly.; Carcinoid tumors, which release a hormone that damages the valve.; Marfan syndrome; Rheumatoid arthritis.; Radiation therapy.; Past use of a diet pill called ""Fen-Phen"" (phentermine and fenfluramine) or dexfenfluramine. The drug was removed from the market in 1997."
000170,Peripheral artery disease - legs,Peripheral vascular disease; PVD; PAD; Arteriosclerosis obliterans; Blockage of leg arteries; Claudication; Intermittent claudication; Vaso-occlusive disease of the legs; Arterial insufficiency of the legs; Recurrent leg pain and cramping; Calf pain with exercise,"The main symptoms of PAD are pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. These symptoms most often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest.; When PAD becomes severe, you may have:; At first, these symptoms may appear only when you walk uphill, walk faster, or walk for longer distances.; Over time, these symptoms occur more quickly and with less exercise.; Your legs or feet may feel numb when you are at rest. The legs also may feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale.; Erectile dysfunction; Pain and cramps at night; Pain or tingling in the feet or toes, which can be so severe that even the weight of clothes or bed sheets is painful; Pain that is worse when you elevate your legs, and improves when you dangle your legs over the side of the bed; Skin that looks dark and blue; Sores that do not heal","PAD is commonly caused by atherosclerosis. This problem occurs when fatty material (plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries and makes them narrower. The walls of the arteries also become stiffer and cannot widen (dilate) to allow greater blood flow when needed.; As a result, the muscles of your legs cannot get enough blood and oxygen when they are working harder (such as during exercise or walking). If PAD becomes severe, there may not be enough blood and oxygen, even when the muscles are resting.; PAD is a common disorder. It most often affects men over age 50, but women can have it as well. People are at higher risk if they have a history of:; Abnormal blood cholesterol level; Diabetes; Heart disease (coronary artery disease); High blood pressure (hypertension); Kidney disease involving hemodialysis; Smoking; Stroke (cerebrovascular disease)"
000171,Atherosclerosis,Hardening of the arteries; Arteriosclerosis; Plaque buildup - arteries; Hyperlipidemia - atherosclerosis; Cholesterol - atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis does not cause symptoms until blood flow to part of the body becomes slowed or blocked.; If the arteries supplying the heart become narrow, blood flow can slow down or stop. This can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, and other symptoms.; Narrowed or blocked arteries may also cause problems in the intestines, kidneys, legs, and brain.","Atherosclerosis often occurs with aging. As you grow older, plaque buildup narrows your arteries and makes them stiffer. These changes make it harder for blood to flow through them.; Clots may form in these narrowed arteries and block blood flow. Pieces of plaque can also break off and move to smaller blood vessels, blocking them.; These blockages starve tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death. It is a common cause of heart attack and stroke.; High blood cholesterol levels can cause hardening of the arteries at a younger age.; For many people, high cholesterol levels are due to a diet that is too high in saturated fats and trans fats.; Other factors that can contribute to hardening of the arteries include:; Diabetes; Family history of hardening of the arteries; High blood pressure; Lack of exercise; Being overweight or obese; Smoking"
000172,Thromboangiitis obliterans,Buerger disease,"Symptoms most often affect 2 or more limbs and may include:; Fingers or toes that appear pale, red, or bluish and feel cold to the touch.; Sudden severe pain in the hands and feet. The pain may feel like a burning or tingling sensation.; Pain in the hands and feet that most often occurs when at rest. The pain may be worse when the hands and feet get cold or during emotional stress.; Pain in the legs, ankles, or feet when walking (intermittent claudication). The pain is often located in the arch of the foot.; Skin changes or small painful ulcers on the fingers or toes.; Occasionally, arthritis in the wrists or knees develops before the blood vessels become blocked.","Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) is caused by small blood vessels that become inflamed and swollen. The blood vessels then narrow or get blocked by blood clots (thrombosis). Blood vessels of the hands and feet are mostly affected. Arteries are more affected than veins. Average age when symptoms begin is around 35. Women and older adults are affected less often.; This condition mostly affects young men ages 20 to 45 who are heavy smokers or chew tobacco. Female smokers may also be affected. The condition affects more people in the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, and Eastern Europe. Many people with this problem have poor dental health, most likely due to tobacco use."
000175,Mitral stenosis,Mitral valve obstruction; Heart mitral stenosis; Valvular mitral stenosis,"Adults may have no symptoms. However, symptoms may appear or get worse with exercise or other activity that raises the heart rate. Symptoms will most often develop between ages 20 and 50.; Symptoms may begin with an episode of atrial fibrillation (especially if it causes a fast heart rate). Symptoms may also be triggered by pregnancy or other stress on the body, such as infection in the heart or lungs, or other heart disorders.; Symptoms may include:; In infants and children, symptoms may be present from birth (congenital). They will almost always develop within the first 2 years of life. Symptoms include:; Chest discomfort that increases with activity and extends to the arm, neck, jaw or other areas (this is rare); Cough, possibly with bloody phlegm; Difficulty breathing during or after exercise (This is the most common symptom.); Waking up due to breathing problems or when lying in a flat position; Fatigue; Frequent respiratory infections, such as bronchitis; Feeling of pounding heart beat (palpitations); Swelling of feet or ankles; Cough; Poor feeding, or sweating when feeding; Poor growth; Shortness of breath","Blood that flows between different chambers of your heart must flow through a valve. The valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of your heart is called the mitral valve. It opens up enough so that blood can flow from the upper chamber of your heart (left atrium) to the lower chamber (left ventricle). It then closes, keeping blood from flowing backwards.; Mitral stenosis means that the valve cannot open enough. As a result, less blood flows to the body. The upper heart chamber swells as pressure builds up. Blood and fluid may then collect in the lung tissue (pulmonary edema), making it hard to breathe.; In adults, mitral stenosis occurs most often in people who have had rheumatic fever. This is a disease that can develop after an illness with strep throat that was not properly treated.; The valve problems develop 5 to 10 years or more after having rheumatic fever. Symptoms may not show up for even longer. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States because strep infections are most often treated. This has made mitral stenosis less common.; Rarely, other factors can cause mitral stenosis in adults. These include:; Children may be born with mitral stenosis (congenital) or other birth defects involving the heart that cause mitral stenosis. Often, there are other heart defects present along with the mitral stenosis.; Mitral stenosis may run in families.; Calcium deposits forming around the mitral valve; Radiation treatment to the chest; Some medicines"
000176,Mitral valve regurgitation,Mitral valve regurgitation; Mitral valve insufficiency; Heart mitral regurgitation; Valvular mitral regurgitation,"Symptoms may begin suddenly if:; There are often no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they often develop gradually, and may include:; A heart attack damages the muscles around the mitral valve.; The cords that attach the muscle to the valve break.; An infection of the valve destroys part of the valve.; Cough; Fatigue, exhaustion, and lightheadedness; Rapid breathing; Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) or a rapid heartbeat; Shortness of breath that increases with activity and when lying down; Waking up an hour or so after falling asleep because of trouble breathing; Urination, excessive at night","Blood that flows between different chambers of your heart must flow through a valve. The valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of your heart is called the mitral valve. It opens up enough so that blood can flow from the upper chamber of your heart (left atrium) to the lower chamber (left ventricle). It then closes, keeping blood from flowing backwards.; When the mitral valve doesn't close all the way, blood flows backward into the upper heart chamber (atrium) from the lower chamber as it contracts. This is called mitral regurgitation and is a common type of heart valve disorder. This cuts down on the amount of blood that flows to the rest of the body. As a result, the heart may try to pump harder. This may lead to congestive heart failure.; Mitral regurgitation may begin suddenly. This often occurs after a heart attack. When the regurgitation does not go away, it becomes long-term (chronic).; Many other diseases or problems can weaken or damage the valve or the heart tissue around the valve. You are at risk for mitral valve regurgitation if you have:; Another important risk factor for mitral regurgitation is past use of a diet pill called ""Fen-Phen"" (fenfluramine and phentermine) or dexfenfluramine. The drug was removed from the market by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 because of safety concerns.; Coronary heart disease and high blood pressure; Infection of the heart valves; Mitral valve prolapse (MVP); Rare conditions, such as untreated syphilis or Marfan syndrome; Rheumatic heart disease. This is a complication of untreated strep throat that is becoming less common.; Swelling of the left lower heart chamber"
000178,Aortic stenosis,Aortic valve stenosis; Rheumatic aortic stenosis; Calcific aortic stenosis; Heart aortic stenosis; Valvular aortic stenosis; Congenital heart - aortic stenosis; Rheumatic fever - aortic stenosis,"Most people with aortic stenosis do not develop symptoms until the disease is advanced. The diagnosis may have been made when the health care provider heard a heart murmur and performed tests before any symptoms developed.; Symptoms of aortic stenosis include:; In infants and children, symptoms include:; Children with mild or moderate aortic stenosis may get worse as they get older. They are also at risk for a heart infection called bacterial endocarditis.; Chest discomfort: The chest pain may get worse with activity and reach into the arm, neck, or jaw. The chest may also feel tight or squeezed.; Cough, possibly bloody.; Breathing problems when exercising.; Becoming easily tired.; Feeling the heartbeat (palpitations).; Fainting, weakness, or dizziness with activity.; Becoming easily tired with exertion (in mild cases); Failure to gain weight; Poor feeding; Serious breathing problems that develop within days or weeks of birth (in severe cases)","As the aortic valve narrows, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood out through the valve. To do this extra work, the muscles in the ventricle walls become thicker. This can lead to chest pain.; As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs. Severe aortic stenosis can limit the amount of blood that reaches the brain and the rest of the body.; Aortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), but most often it develops later in life. Children with aortic stenosis may have other conditions present from birth.; Aortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. This is called calcific aortic stenosis. The problem mostly affects older people.; Calcium buildup of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves. In rare cases, calcium buildup can develop more quickly when a person has received chest radiation (such as for cancer treatment).; Another cause is rheumatic fever. This condition can develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 to 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States.; Aortic stenosis occurs in about 2% of people over 65 years of age. It occurs more often in men than in women."
000179,Aortic regurgitation,Aortic valve prolapse; Aortic insufficiency; Heart valve - aortic regurgitation; Valvular disease - aortic regurgitation; AI - aortic insufficiency,"The condition often has no symptoms for many years. Symptoms may come on slowly or suddenly. They may include:; Bounding pulse; Chest pain similar to angina (rare); Fainting; Fatigue; Palpitations (sensation of the heart beating); Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down; Waking up short of breath after falling asleep; Swelling of the feet, legs, or abdomen; Uneven, rapid, racing, pounding, or fluttering pulse; Weakness that is more likely to occur with activity","Any condition that prevents the aortic valve from closing completely can cause this problem. When the valve does not close all the way, some blood comes back each time the heart beats.; When a large amount of blood comes back, the heart must work harder to force out enough blood to meet the body's needs. The left lower chamber (left ventricle) of the heart widens (dilates) and the heart beats very strongly (bounding pulse). Over time, the heart becomes less able to supply enough blood to the body.; In the past, rheumatic fever was the main cause of aortic regurgitation. The use of antibiotics to treat strep infections has made rheumatic fever less common. Therefore, aortic regurgitation is more commonly due to other causes. These include:; Aortic insufficiency is most common in men between the ages of 30 and 60.; Ankylosing spondylitis; Aortic dissection; Congenital (present at birth) valve problems, such as bicuspid valve; Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves); High blood pressure; Marfan syndrome; Reiter syndrome (also known as reactive arthritis); Syphilis; Systemic lupus erythematosus; Trauma to the chest"

A group of symptoms sometimes found in people with mitral valve prolapse has been called ""mitral valve prolapse syndrome,"" and includes:; The exact relationship is between these symptoms and the valve problem is not clear. Some of the findings may be coincidental.; When mitral regurgitation occurs, symptoms may be related to the leaking, particularly when severe.; Chest pain (not caused by coronary artery disease or a heart attack); Dizziness; Fatigue; Panic attacks; Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations); Shortness of breath with activity or when lying flat (orthopnea)","The mitral valve helps blood on the left side of the heart flow in one direction. It closes to keep blood from moving backwards when the heart beats (contracts).; Mitral valve prolapse is the term used when the valve does not close properly. It can be caused by many different things.; In most cases, it is harmless. The problem generally does not affect health and most people with the condition are not aware of it. In a small number of cases, the prolapse can cause blood to leak backwards. This is called mitral regurgitation.; Mitral valve prolapse often affects thin women who may have minor chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or other disorders. Some forms of mitral valve prolapse seem to be passed down through families (inherited).; Mitral valve prolapse is also seen with some connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and other rare genetic disorders.; It is also sometimes seen in isolation in people who are otherwise normal."
000181,Aortic dissection,Aortic aneurysm - dissecting; Chest pain - aortic dissection; Thoracic aortic aneurysm - dissection,"In most cases, the symptoms begin suddenly, and include severe chest pain. The pain may feel like a heart attack.; Symptoms are caused by a decrease of blood flowing to the rest of the body, and can include:; Other symptoms may include:; Pain can be described as sharp, stabbing, tearing, or ripping.; It is felt below the breast bone, and then moves under the shoulder blades or to the back.; Pain can move to the shoulder, neck, arm, jaw, abdomen, or hips.; The pain changes position, often moving to the arms and legs as the aortic dissection gets worse.; Anxiety and a feeling of doom; Fainting or dizziness; Heavy sweating (clammy skin); Nausea and vomiting; Pale skin (pallor); Rapid, weak pulse; Shortness of breath and trouble breathing when lying flat (orthopnea); Pain in the abdomen; Stroke symptoms; Swallowing difficulties from pressure on the esophagus","When it leaves the heart, the aorta first moves up through the chest towards the head (the ascending aorta). It then bends or arches, and finally moves down through the chest and abdomen (the descending aorta).; Aortic dissection most often happens because of a tear or damage to the inner wall of the aorta. This very often occurs in the chest (thoracic) part of the artery, but it may also occur in the abdominal aorta.; When a tear occurs, it creates 2 channels:; If the channel with non-traveling blood gets bigger, it can push on other branches of the aorta. This can narrow the other branches and reduce blood flow through them.; An aortic dissection may also cause abnormal widening or ballooning of the aorta (aneurysm).; The exact cause is unknown, but more common risks include:; Other risk factors and conditions linked to aortic dissection include:; Aortic dissection occurs in about 2 out of every 10,000 people. It can affect anyone, but is most often seen in men ages 40 to 70.; One in which blood continues to travel; Another where blood stays still; Aging; Atherosclerosis; Blunt trauma to the chest, such as hitting the steering wheel of a car during an accident; High blood pressure; Bicuspid aortic valve; Coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta; Connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and rare genetic disorders; Heart surgery or procedures; Pregnancy; Swelling of the blood vessels due to conditions such as arteritis and syphilis"

They can last for a few minutes or several hours. Symptoms may include:; Other symptoms that can occur with this condition include:; Anxiety; Chest tightness; Palpitations (a sensation of feeling the heartbeat), often with an irregular or fast rate (racing); Rapid pulse; Shortness of breath; Dizziness; Fainting","Normally, the chambers of the heart (atria and ventricles) contract in a coordinated manner.; The rapid heart rate from PSVT may start with events that occur in areas of the heart above the lower chambers (ventricles).; There are a number of specific causes of PSVT. It can develop when doses of the heart medicine, digitalis, are too high. It can also occur with a condition known as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which often causes symptoms in young people and infants.; The following increase your risk for PSVT:; The contractions are caused by an electrical signal that begins in an area of the heart called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node).; The signal moves through the upper heart chambers (the atria) and tells the atria to contract.; After this, the signal moves down in the heart and tells the lower chambers (the ventricles) to contract.; Alcohol use; Caffeine use; Illicit stimulant drug use; Smoking"

Call 911 or the local emergency number right away if you have chest pain or pressure.","When working well, the 4 chambers of the heart contract (squeeze) in an organized way.; Electrical signals direct your heart to pump the right amount of blood for your body's needs. The signals begin in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node).; In people with AFib, the electrical impulse of the heart is not regular. This is because the sinoatrial node no longer controls the sequence of heart muscle contractions (rhythm) in the upper chambers of the heart (atria).; In AFib:Â; In people with atrial flutter, the atria beat very rapidly, but in a regular pattern.; These problems can affect both men and women. They become more common with increasing age.; Common causes of AFib include:; The atria do not contract in an organized pattern.; The lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) contract in an irregular manner that is often too fast.; As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.; Alcohol use (especially binge drinking); Coronary artery disease; Heart attack or heart bypass surgery; Heart failure or an enlarged heart; Heart valve disease (most often the mitral valve); Hypertension; Medicines; Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism); Pericarditis; Sick sinus syndrome"

Many of these occur during or after a heart attack (myocardial infarction). These complications include:; Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to supply as much blood as the body needs. It can happen even if there hasn't been a heart attack. For example, if one of these problems listed above occurs and your heart function drops suddenly. Or if a valve becomes obstructed or if a combination of problems occurs.; A large section of heart muscle that no longer moves well or does not move at all; Breaking open (rupture) of the heart muscle due to damage from the heart attack; Dangerous heart rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or supraventricular tachycardia; Pressure on the heart due to a buildup of fluid around it (pericardial tamponade); Tear or rupture of the muscles or tendons that support the heart valves, especially the mitral valve; Tear or rupture of the wall (septum) between the left and right ventricles (lower heart chambers); Very slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) or problem with the electrical system of the heart (heart block)"

Normally, these signals begin in an area of the upper right chamber called the sinoatrial node (sinus node or SA node). This node is considered the heart's ""natural pacemaker."" It helps control the heartbeat. When the heart detects a signal, it contracts (or beats).; The normal heart rate in adults is 60 to 100 beats per minute. The normal heart rate is faster in children.; In MAT, many locations in the atria fire signals at the same time. Too many signals lead to a rapid heart rate. It most often ranges from 100 to 130 beats per minute or more in adults. The rapid heart rate may cause the heart to work too hard and not move blood efficiently. If the heartbeat is very fast, there is less time for the heart chamber to fill with blood between beats. Therefore, not enough blood is pumped to the brain and the rest of the body with each contraction.; MAT is most common in people age 50 and over. It is often seen in people with conditions that lower the amount of oxygen in the blood. These conditions include:; You may be at higher risk for MAT if you have:; When the heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, the arrhythmia is called ""wandering atrial pacemaker.""; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Heart failure (also called congestive heart failure); Lung cancer; Lung failure; Pneumonia; Pulmonary embolism; Coronary heart disease; Diabetes; Had surgery within the last 6 weeks; Overdosed on the drug theophylline; Sepsis"

Most of the time, it also pumps normally. However, it does not relax normally during the time between heartbeats when the blood returns from the body (diastole).; Although the main problem is abnormal filling of the heart, the heart may not pump blood strongly when the disease progresses. The abnormal heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may affect either or both of the lower heart chambers (ventricles). Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare condition. The most common causes are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause. It also can occur after a heart transplant.; Other causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy include:; Cardiac amyloidosis; Carcinoid heart disease; Diseases of the heart lining (endocardium), such as endomyocardial fibrosis and Loeffler syndrome (rare); Iron overload (hemochromatosis); Sarcoidosis; Scarring after radiation or chemotherapy; Scleroderma; Tumors of the heart"

In severe cases, the infant may develop heart failure and shock.; In milder cases, symptoms may not develop until the child has reached adolescence. Symptoms can include:; There may also be no symptoms.; Chest pain; Cold feet or legs; Dizziness or fainting; Decreased ability to exercise; Failure to thrive; Leg cramps with exercise; Nosebleed; Poor growth; Pounding headache; Shortness of breath","The exact cause of coarctation of the aorta is unknown. It results from abnormalities in development of the aorta prior to birth.; Aortic coarctation is more common in people with certain genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome.; Aortic coarctation is one of the more common heart conditions that are present at birth (congenital heart defects). This abnormality accounts for about 5% of all congenital heart defects. It is most often diagnosed in children or adults under age 40.; People who have this problem with their aorta may also have a weak area in the wall of blood vessels in their brain. This weakness causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out. This is known as a berry aneurysm. These may rupture causing a certain type of stroke (due to bleeding).; Coarctation of the aorta may be seen with other congenital heart defects, such as:; Bicuspid aortic valve; Aortic stenosis; Ventricular septal defect; Patent ductus arteriosus"

When present, symptoms may include:; Excessive urination at night; Fatigue, reduced exercise ability; Palpitations (sensation of feeling heartbeat); Shortness of breath with activity; Swelling of the abdomen, legs, ankles, or other part of the body; Trouble breathing while lying down","Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which clumps of proteins called amyloid build up in body tissues. Over time, these proteins replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis.; Cardiac amyloidosis (""stiff heart syndrome"") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical type of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical signals move through the heart (conduction system). This can lead to abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) and faulty heart signals (heart block).; The condition can be inherited. This is called familial cardiac amyloidosis. It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of another medical problem causing inflammation. Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. The disease is rare in people under age 40."

This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle. This is the most common cause of heart attack.; When you are resting or asleep; After a sudden increase in physical activity; When you are active outside in cold weather; After sudden, severe emotional or physical stress, including an illness"
000198,Stable angina,Angina - stable; Angina - chronic; Angina pectoris; Chest pain - angina; CAD - angina; Coronary artery disease - angina; Heart disease - angina,"Symptoms of stable angina are most often predictable. This means that the same amount of exercise or activity may cause your angina to occur. Your angina should improve or go away when you stop or slow down the exercise.; The most common symptom is chest pain that occurs behind the breastbone or slightly to the left of it. The pain of stable angina most often begins slowly and gets worse over the next few minutes before going away.; Typically, the chest pain feels like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or a crushing feeling.

The coronary arteries carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart.; When the heart muscle has to work harder, it needs more oxygen. Symptoms of angina may occur when blood supply to the heart muscle is reduced. This happens when the coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked by atherosclerosis or by a blood clot.; The most common cause of angina is coronary artery disease. Angina pectoris is the medical term for this type of chest pain.; Stable angina is less serious than unstable angina, but it can be very painful or uncomfortable.; There are many risk factors for coronary artery disease. Some include:; Anything that makes the heart muscle need more oxygen or reduces the amount of oxygen it receives can cause an angina attack in someone with heart disease, including:; Other causes of angina include:; Diabetes; Family history of early coronary heart disease (a close relative such as a sibling or parent had heart disease before age 55 in a man or before age 65 in a woman); High blood pressure; High LDL cholesterol; Low HDL cholesterol; Obesity; Sedentary lifestyle; Smoking; Advancing age; Male sex; Cold weather; Exercise; Emotional stress; Large meals; Abnormal heart rhythms (your heart beats very quickly or your heart rhythm is not regular); Anemia; Coronary artery spasm (also called Prinzmetal angina); Heart failure; Heart valve disease; Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)"

With long-term (chronic) venous insufficiency, vein walls are weakened and valves are damaged. This causes the veins to stay filled with blood, especially when you are standing.; Chronic venous insufficiency is a long-term condition. It is most commonly due to malfunctioning (incompetent) valves in the veins. It may also occur as the result of a past blood clot in the legs.; Risk factors for venous insufficiency include:; Age; Family history of this condition; Female sex (related to levels of the hormone progesterone); History of deep vein thrombosis in the legs; Obesity; Pregnancy; Sitting or standing for long periods; Tall height"

This problem most often occurs when a sticky, fatty substance called plaque builds up on the inner lining of the arteries, causing a condition known as atherosclerosis.; When the arteries that carry blood to your kidneys become narrow, less blood flows to the kidneys. The kidneys mistakenly respond as if your blood pressure is low. As a result, they release hormones that tell the body to hold on to more salt and water. This causes your blood pressure to rise.; Risk factors for atherosclerosis:; Fibromuscular dysplasia is another cause of renal artery stenosis. It is typically seen in women under age 50. It tends to run in families. The condition is caused by abnormal growth of cells in the walls of the arteries leading to the kidneys. This also leads to narrowing or blockage of these arteries.; High blood pressure; Smoking; Diabetes; High cholesterol; Heavy alcohol use; Cocaine use; Increasing age"

But if the lining breaks down, the result may be:; Most ulcers occur in the first, inner surface, layer of the inner lining. A hole in the stomach or duodenum is called a perforation. This is a medical emergency.; The most common cause of ulcers is infection of the stomach by bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). Most people with peptic ulcers have these bacteria living in their digestive tract. Yet, many people who have these bacteria in their stomach do not develop an ulcer.; The following factors raise your risk for peptic ulcers:; A rare condition, called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, causes the stomach to produce too much acid, leading to stomach and duodenal ulcers.; Swollen and inflamed tissue (gastritis); An ulcer; Drinking too much alcohol; Regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); Smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco; Being very ill, such as being on a breathing machine; Radiation treatments; Stress"

As a result, a person may become malnourished.; The breakdown of nutrients by the excess bacteria can also damage the lining of the small intestine. This can make it even harder for the body to absorb nutrients.; Conditions that can lead to overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine include:; Complications of diseases or surgery that create pouches or blockages in the small intestine. Crohn disease is one of these conditions.; Diseases that lead to decreased movement of the small bowel, such as diabetes and scleroderma.; Immunodeficiency, such as AIDS or immunoglobulin deficiency.; Short bowel syndrome caused by surgical removal of the small intestine.; Small bowel diverticulosis, in which small, or, at times, large sacs occur in the wall of the intestine. These sacs allow too many bacteria to grow.; Surgical procedures that create a loop of small intestine where excess bacteria can grow. An example is a Billroth II type of stomach removal (gastrectomy).; Some cases of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)."

This hormone increases secretions from the intestines. It also relaxes some of the smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal system.; The exact cause of VIPomas is not known.; VIPomas are often diagnosed in adults, most commonly around age 50. Women are more likely to be affected than men. This cancer is rare. Each year, only about 1 in 1 million people are diagnosed with a VIPoma."
000230,Fecal impaction,Impaction of the bowels; Constipation - impaction; Neurogenic bowel - impaction,"Common symptoms include:; Other possible symptoms include:; Abdominal cramping and bloating; Leakage of liquid or sudden episodes of watery diarrhea in someone who has chronic (long-term) constipation; Rectal bleeding; Small, semi-formed stools; Straining when trying to pass stools; Bladder pressure or loss of bladder control; Lower back pain; Rapid heartbeat or lightheadedness from straining to pass stool","Constipation is when you are not passing stool as often or as easily as is normal for you. Your stool becomes hard and dry. This makes it difficult to pass.; Fecal impaction often occurs in people who have had constipation for a long time.; You are at more risk for chronic constipation and fecal impaction if:; Certain medicines slow the passage of stool through the bowels:; You do not move around much and spend most of your time in a chair or bed.; You have a disease of the brain or nervous system that damages the nerves that go to the muscles of the intestines.; Anticholinergics, which affect the interaction between nerves and muscles of the bowel; Medicines used to treat diarrhea, if they are taken too often; Narcotic pain medicine, such as methadone, codeine, and oxycodone"

This often results in infection of the mediastinum (mediastinitis).; The most common cause of an esophageal perforation is injury during a medical procedure. However, the use of flexible instruments has made this problem uncommon.; The esophagus may also become perforated as the result of:; Less common causes include injuries to the esophagus area (blunt trauma) and injury to the esophagus during surgery of another organ near the esophagus.; A tumor; Gastric reflux with ulceration; Previous surgery on the esophagus; Swallowing a foreign object or caustic chemicals, such as household cleaners, disk batteries, and battery acid; Trauma or injury to the chest and esophagus; Violent vomiting (Boerhaave syndrome)"
000233,Celiac disease â sprue,Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy; Celiac sprue,"The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. This can make diagnosis difficult. For example, one person may have constipation, a second may have diarrhea, and a third may have no problem with stools.; Gastrointestinal symptoms include:; Other problems that can develop over time because the intestines do not absorb key nutrients include:; Children with celiac disease may have:; Abdominal pain, bloating, gas, or indigestion; Constipation; Decreased appetite (may also be increased or unchanged); Diarrhea, either constant or off and on; Lactose intolerance (common when the person is diagnosed, often goes away after treatment); Nausea and vomiting; Stools that are foul smelling, oily, or stick to the toilet when flushed; Unexplained weight loss (although people can be overweight or normal weight); Easy bruising; Depression or anxiety; Fatigue; Growth delay in children; Hair loss; Itchy skin with a rash (dermatitis herpetiformis); Missed menstrual periods; Mouth ulcers; Muscle cramps and joint pain; Nosebleeds; Seizures; Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet; Unexplained short height; Defects in the tooth enamel and changes in tooth color; Delayed puberty; Muscle wasting; Diarrhea, constipation, fatty or foul-smelling stools, nausea, or vomiting; Irritable and fussy behavior; Poor weight gain; Slowed growth and shorter than normal height for their age","The exact cause of celiac disease is not known. The lining of the intestines have small areas called villi which project outward into the opening of the intestine. These structures help absorb nutrients.; When people with celiac disease eat foods with gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. Because of the damage, the villi are unable to properly absorb iron, vitamins, and other nutrients. This may cause a number of symptoms and other health problems.; The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.; People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk of developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Europeans.; People with celiac disease are more likely to have:; Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and SjÃ¶gren syndrome; Addison disease; Down syndrome; Intestinal cancer; Intestinal lymphoma; Lactose intolerance; Thyroid disease; Type 1 diabetes"

It is more common in older adults. It is almost always seen on the right side of the colon.; Most likely, the problem develops due to normal movement of the colon that causes the blood vessels in the area to enlarge. When this swelling becomes severe, a tiny passageway develops between a small artery and vein. This is called an arteriovenous malformation. Bleeding can occur from this area in the colon wall. Other causes include certain heart and lung conditions.; Rarely, angiodysplasia of the colon is related to other diseases of the blood vessels. One of these is Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. The condition is not related to cancer. It is also different from diverticulosis, which is a more common cause of intestinal bleeding in older adults."

In order to inherit the condition, a child must get a copy of the variant gene from both parents.; The syndrome interferes with the body's ability to move bilirubin through the liver into the bile. When the liver and spleen break down worn out red blood cells, bilirubin is produced. Bilirubin normally moves into the bile, which is produced by the liver. It then flows into the bile ducts, is stored in the gallbladder, and then flows into the digestive system.; When bilirubin is not properly transported into the bile, it builds up in the bloodstream. This causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This is called jaundice. Severely high levels of bilirubin can damage the brain and other organs.; People with DJS have lifelong mild jaundice that may be made worse by:; Alcohol; Birth control pills; Environmental factors that affect the liver; Infection; Pregnancy; Fasting or dehydration; Fatigue"

However, the National Institutes of Health estimates that it affects about 1 in 50,000 to 200,000 people.; PJS is caused by a mutation in the gene called STK11 (previously known as LKB1). There are two ways that PJS can occur:; Familial PJS is inherited in families as an autosomal dominant trait. That means if one of your parents has this type of PJS, you have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and having the disease.; Spontaneous PJS is not inherited from a parent. The gene mutation occurs on its own. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it."

Most people have mild symptoms. You are said to have IBS when symptoms are present for at least 3 days a month for a period of 3 months or more.; The main symptoms include:; Pain and other symptoms will often be reduced or go away after a bowel movement. Symptoms may flare up when there is a change in the frequency of your bowel movements.; People with IBS may go back and forth between having constipation and diarrhea or have or mostly have one or the other.; The symptoms may get worse for a few weeks or a month, and then decrease for a while. In other cases, symptoms are present most of the time.; You may also lose your appetite if you have IBS. However, blood in stools and unintentional weight loss are not a part of IBS.; Abdominal pain and cramps; Gas; Fullness; Bloating; Change in bowel habits. You canÂ have either diarrhea (IBS-D), or constipation (IBS-C).; If you have IBS with diarrhea, you will have frequent, loose, watery stools. You may have an urgent need to have a bowel movement, which may be hard to control.; If you have IBS with constipation, you will have a hard time passing stool, as well as fewer bowel movements. You may need to strain with a bowel movement and have cramps. Often, only a small amount or no stool at all will pass.","The reasons why IBS develops are not clear. It can occur after a bacterial infection or a parasitic infection (giardiasis) of the intestines. This is called postinfectious IBS. There may also be other triggers, including stress.; The intestine is connected to the brain by hormone and nerve signals that go back and forth between the bowel and the brain. These signals affect bowel function and symptoms. The nerves can become more active during stress. This can cause the intestines to be more sensitive and contract more.; IBS can occur at any age. Often, it begins in the teen years or early adulthood. It is twice as common in women as in men.; Â It is less likely to begin in people above 50 years of age.; AboutÂ 10% to 15% of people in the United States have symptoms of IBS. It is the most common intestinal problem that causes people to be referred to a bowel specialist (gastroenterologist)."
000247,Pancreas divisum,Pancreatic divisum,"Many people do not have any symptoms. If you have pancreatitis, symptoms include:; Abdominal pain, most often in the upper abdomen that may be felt in the back; Abdominal swelling (distention); Nausea or vomiting","Pancreas divisum is the most common birth defect of the pancreas. In many cases, this defect goes undetected and causes no problems. The cause of the defect is unknown.; As a baby develops in the womb (uterus), two separate pieces of tissue join together to form the pancreas. Each part has a tube, called a duct. When the parts join together, a final duct, called the pancreatic duct, is formed. Fluid and digestive juices (enzymes) produced by the pancreas normally flow through this duct.; Pancreas divisum occurs if the ducts do not join while the baby develops. Fluid from the two parts of the pancreas drains into separate areas of the upper portion of the small intestine (duodenum). This occurs in 5% to 15% of people.; If a pancreatic duct becomes blocked, swelling and tissue damage (pancreatitis) may develop."

They include:; Pain or discomfort, usually in the left lower part of the abdomen; Bloating or gas; Fever and chills; Nausea and vomiting; Not feeling hungry and not eating","The formation of pouches or sacs on the intestinal lining is called diverticulosis. It is found in more than half of Americans over age 60. However, no one knows exactly what causes the pouches to form.; Eating a low-fiber diet mostly made up of processed foods may be a cause. Constipation and hard stools are more likely when you do not eat enough fiber. Straining to pass stools increases the pressure in the colon or intestines, which may lead to the formation of these pouches.; In some cases, one of the pouches can become inflamed and a small tear develops in the lining of the intestine. This can lead to an infection at the site. When this occurs, the condition is called diverticulitis. The cause of diverticulitis is not known."

However, too much of these bacteria may grow when you take antibiotic medicines. The bacteria give off a strong toxin that causes inflammation and bleeding in the lining of the colon.; Any antibiotic can cause this condition. The medicines responsible for the problem most of the time are ampicillin, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins.; Health care providers in the hospital may pass this bacteria from one patient to another.; Pseudomembranous colitis is uncommon in children, and rare in infants. It is most often seen in people who are in the hospital. However, it is becoming more common in people who take antibiotics and are not in a hospital.; Risk factors include:; Older age; Antibiotic use; Use of medicines that weaken the immune system (such as chemotherapy medicines); Recent surgery; History of pseudomembranous colitis; History of ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

You may feel:; Other symptoms that may occur include:; Sharp, cramping, or dull pain; Steady pain; Pain that spreads to your back or below your right shoulder blade; Clay-colored stools; Fever; Nausea and vomiting; Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)","The gallbladder is an organ that sits below the liver. It stores bile, which is produced in the liver. Your body uses bile to digest fats in the small intestine.; Acute cholecystitis occurs when bile becomes trapped in the gallbladder. This often happens because a gallstone blocks the cystic duct, the tube through which bile travels into and out of the gallbladder. When a stone blocks this duct, bile builds up, causing irritation and pressure in the gallbladder. This can lead to swelling and infection.; Other causes include:; Some people are more at risk for gallstones. Risk factors include:; Sometimes, the bile duct becomes blocked temporarily. When this occurs repeatedly, it can lead to long-term (chronic) cholecystitis. This is swelling and irritation that continues over time. Eventually, the gallbladder becomes thick and hard.

A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus prevents swallowed food from moving back up. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).; When this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux may cause symptoms. Harsh stomach acids can also damage the lining of the esophagus.; The risk factors for reflux include:; Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux can be caused by or made worse by pregnancy.

It may also occur in those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes. The condition may be brought on by:; Normally, the kidneys try to make up for a high glucose level in the blood by allowing the extra glucose to leave the body in the urine. But this also causes the body to lose water. If you do not drink enough water, or you drink fluids that contain sugar and keep eating foods with carbohydrates, you become very dehydrated. When this occurs, the kidneys are no longer able to get rid of the extra glucose. As a result, the glucose level in your blood can become very high, sometimes more than 10 times the normal amount.; The loss of water also makes the blood more concentrated than normal. This is called hyperosmolarity. It is a condition in which the blood has a high concentration of salt (sodium), glucose, and other substances. This draws the water out of the body's other organs, including the brain.; Risk factors include:; Extremely high blood sugar level; Extreme lack of water (dehydration); Decreased alertness or consciousness (in many cases); Infection; Other illness, such as heart attack or stroke; Medicines that decrease the effect of insulin in the body; Medicines or conditions that increase fluid loss; Running out of, or not taking prescribed diabetes medicines; A stressful event such as infection, heart attack, stroke, or recent surgery; Heart failure; Impaired thirst; Limited access to water (especially in people with dementia or who are bedbound); Older age; Poor kidney function; Poor management of diabetes, not following the treatment plan as directed; Stopping or running out of insulin or other medicines that lower glucose level"

It is most often diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults.; Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. With type 1 diabetes, beta cells produce little or no insulin.; Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells. This buildup of glucose in the blood is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 1 diabetes.; The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. It is an autoimmune disorder. This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. In people with type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. The tendency to develop autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, can be inherited from your parents."

Symptoms include:; Constipation; Less weight gain than other children of similar age and sex (growth failure); Frequent urination (urinary frequency); Low blood pressure; Kidney stones; Muscle cramping and weakness,"There are five gene defects known to be associated with Bartter syndrome. The condition is present at birth (congenital).; The condition is caused by a defect in the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium. People affected by Bartter syndrome lose too much sodium through the urine. This causes a rise in the level of the hormone aldosterone, and makes the kidneys remove too much potassium from the body. This is known as potassium wasting.; The condition also results in an abnormal acid balance in the blood called hypokalemic alkalosis, which causes too much calcium in the urine."
000309,Factitious hyperthyroidism,Factitious thyrotoxicosis; Thyrotoxicosis factitia; Thyrotoxicosis medicamentosa; Factitious hyperthyroxinemia,"The symptoms of factitious hyperthyroidism are the same as those of hyperthyroidism caused by a thyroid gland disorder, except that:; There is no goiter. The thyroid gland is often small.; The eyes do not bulge, as they do in Graves disease (the most common type of hyperthyroidism).; The skin over the shins does not thicken, as it sometimes does in people who have Graves disease.","The thyroid gland produces the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). In most cases of hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland itself produces too much of these hormones.; Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by taking too much thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism. This is called factitious hyperthyroidism. When this occurs because the prescribed dosage of hormone medicine is too high, it is called iatrogenic, or doctor-induced, hyperthyroidism. This is common. Sometimes this is intentional (for some people with depression or thyroid cancer), but often this happens because the dose is not adjusted based on follow-up blood tests.; Factitious hyperthyroidism can also occur when someone takes too much thyroid hormone on purpose and may conceal this. This is very uncommon. These may be people:; Children may take thyroid hormone pills accidentally.; Who have mental disorders such as Munchausen syndrome; Who are trying to lose weight; Who are being treated for depression or infertility"

There is normal muscle strength between attacks.; Attacks usually begin in the teen years, but they can occur before age 10. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have attacks every day. Others have them once a year. During attacks the person remains alert.; The weakness or paralysis:; Another symptom may include eyelid myotonia (a condition in which after opening and closing the eyes, they cannot be opened for a short time).; Most commonly occurs at the shoulders and hips; May also affect the arms, legs, muscles of the eyes, and muscles that help with breathing and swallowing; Occurs off and on; Most commonly occurs on awakening or after sleep or rest; Is rare during exercise, but may be triggered by resting after exercise; May be triggered by high-carbohydrate, high-salt meals, stress, pregnancy, heavy exercise, and cold; An attack usually lasts for several hours up to a day","HypoPP is congenital. This means it is present at birth. In most cases, it is passed down through families (inherited) as an autosomal dominant disorder. In other words, only one parent needs to pass the gene related to this condition on to their child in order for the child to be affected.; In some cases, the condition may be the result of a genetic problem that is not inherited.; Unlike other forms of periodic paralysis, people with hypoPP have normal thyroid function. But they have a very low blood level of potassium during episodes of weakness. This results from potassium moving from the blood into muscle cells in an abnormal way.; Risk factors include having other family members with periodic paralysis. The risk is slightly higher in Asian men who also have thyroid disorders."

The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy.; When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, glucose does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.; When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.; Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.; Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are not overweight or obese. This is more common in older adults.; Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease."
000314,Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion,SIADH; Inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone; Syndrome of inappropriate ADH release; Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis,"With SIADH, the urine is very concentrated. Not enough water is excreted and there is too much water in the blood. This dilutes many substances in the blood such as sodium. A low blood sodium level is the most common cause of symptoms of too much ADH. It is also the most common clue that a person may have SIADH.; Often, there are no symptoms from a mildly low sodium level. More symptoms occur the lower the level of the sodium.; When symptoms do occur, they may include any of the following:; Nausea and vomiting; Headache; Problems with balance that may result in falls; Mental changes, such as confusion, memory problems, strange behavior; Seizures or coma, in severe cases","There are many reasons why your body may make a lot of ADH. Common situations when ADH is released into the blood when it should not be produced (inappropriate) include:; Rare causes include:; Medicines, such as certain seizure medicines, antidepressants, cancer medicines, opiates (less often), and heart, diabetes, and blood pressure medicines; Surgery under general anesthesia; Disorders of the brain, such as injury, infections, and stroke; Brain surgery in the region of the hypothalamus; Tuberculosis, cancer, chronic infections, and lung disease, such as pneumonia; Substance use disorder; Rare diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary; Leukemia and cancer of the small intestine, pancreas, and brain; Mental disorders"
000315,Magnesium deficiency,Low blood magnesium; Magnesium - low; Hypomagnesemia,Common symptoms include:; Abnormal eye movements (nystagmus); Convulsions; Fatigue; Muscle spasms or cramps; Muscle weakness; Numbness,"Every organ in the body, especially the heart, muscles, and kidneys, needs the mineral magnesium. It also contributes to the makeup of teeth and bones. Magnesium is needed for many functions in the body. This includes the physical and chemical processes in the body that convert or use energy (metabolism).; When the level of magnesium in the body drops below normal, symptoms may develop due to low magnesium.; Common causes of low magnesium include:; Alcohol use; Burns that affect a large area of the body; Chronic diarrhea; Excessive urination (polyuria), such as in uncontrolled diabetes and during recovery from acute kidney injury; Hyperaldosteronism (disorder in which the adrenal gland releases too much of the hormone aldosterone into the blood); Kidney tubule disorders; Malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease; Malnutrition; Medicines including amphotericin, antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, cisplatin, cyclosporine, diuretics, proton pump inhibitors, tacrolimus, and aminoglycoside antibiotics; Pancreatitis (swelling and inflammation of the pancreas); Excessive sweating"
000316,Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis,Periodic paralysis - hyperkalemic; Familial hyperkalemic periodic paralysis; HyperKPP; HyperPP; Gamstorp disease; Potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis,"Symptoms include attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement (paralysis) that come and go. There is normal muscle strength between attacks.; Attacks usually begin in childhood. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have several attacks a day.

Some people have associated myotonia, in which they cannot immediately relax their muscles after use.; The weakness or paralysis:; Triggers may include:; Most commonly occurs at the shoulders, back, and hips; May also involve the arms and legs, but does not affect muscles of the eyes and muscles that help with breathing and swallowing; Most commonly occurs while resting after activity or exercise; May occur on awakening; Occurs on and off; Usually lasts 15 minutes to 1 hour, but may last up to an entire day; Eating a high carbohydrate meal; Rest after exercise; Exposure to cold; Skipping meals; Eating potassium-rich foods or taking medicines that contain potassium; Stress","HyperPP is congenital. This means it is present at birth. In most cases, it is passed down through families (inherited) as an autosomal dominant disorder. In other words, only one parent needs to pass the gene related to this condition on to their child in order for the child to be affected.; Occasionally, the condition may be the result of a genetic problem that is not inherited.; It is believed that the disorder is related to problems with the way the body controls sodium and potassium levels in cells.; Risk factors include having other family members with periodic paralysis. It affects men and women equally."

It occurs most often in older adults. Risk factors include being female and over 55 years old. This disorder is rare in children. Most people who develop it have had a goiter with nodules for many years. Sometimes the thyroid gland is only slightly enlarged, and the goiter was not already diagnosed.; Sometimes, people with toxic multinodular goiter will develop high thyroid hormone levels for the first time after:; Taking iodine through a vein (intravenously) or by mouth. The iodine may be used as contrast for a CT scan or heart catheterization (most common); Taking medicines that contain iodine, such as amiodarone; Moving from a country with iodine deficiency to a country with a lot of iodine in the diet"
000319,Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis,Periodic paralysis - thyrotoxic; Hyperthyroidism - periodic paralysis,"Symptoms involve attacks of muscle weakness or paralysis. Between attacks, normal muscle function returns. Attacks often begin after symptoms of hyperthyroidism have developed. Hyperthyroid symptoms may be subtle.; The attacks may occur daily to yearly. Episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis may:; Other rare symptoms may include any of the following:; During attacks, you will be alert and can answer questions. Normal strength returns between attacks. With repeated attacks, you may develop muscle weakness.; Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:; Come and go; Last from a few hours up to several days (rare); Occur more often in the legs than the arms; Be most common in the shoulders and hips; Be triggered by heavy, high-carbohydrate, high-salt meals; Be triggered during rest after exercise; Trouble breathing; Speech problems; Trouble swallowing; Vision changes; Excessive sweating; Fast heart rate; Fatigue; Headache; Heat intolerance; Increased appetite; Insomnia; Having bowel movements more often; Feeling strong heartbeat (palpitations); Tremors of the hand; Warm, moist skin; Weight loss","This rare condition occurs only in people with high (usually very high) thyroid hormone levels (thyrotoxicosis).

Most people who develop high thyroid hormone levels are not at risk of periodic paralysis.; Hypokalemic, or familial, periodic paralysis is a similar disorder. It is an inherited condition and not related to high thyroid levels, but has the same symptoms.; Risk factors include a family history of periodic paralysis and hyperthyroidism."
000320,Diabetic ketoacidosis,DKA; Ketoacidosis; Diabetes - ketoacidosis,"Common symptoms of DKA can include:; Decreased alertness; Deep, rapid breathing; Dehydration; Dry skin and mouth; Flushed face; Frequent urination or thirst that lasts for a day or more; Fruity-smelling breath; Headache; Muscle stiffness or aches; Nausea and vomiting; Stomach pain","DKA happens when the signal from insulin in the body is so low that:; The fat is broken down by the liver into a fuel called ketones. Ketones are normally produced by the liver when the body breaks down fat after it has been a long time since your last meal. These ketones are normally used by the muscles and the heart. When ketones are produced too quickly and build up in the blood, they can be toxic by making the blood acidic. This condition is known as ketoacidosis.; DKA is sometimes the first sign of type 1 diabetes in people who have not yet been diagnosed. It can also occur in someone who has already been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Infection, injury, a serious illness, missing doses of insulin shots, or the stress of surgery can lead to DKA in people with type 1 diabetes.; People with type 2 diabetes can also develop DKA, but it is much less common and less severe. It is usually triggered by prolonged uncontrolled blood sugar, missing doses of medicines, or a severe illness or infection.; Blood sugar (glucose) can't go into cells to be used as a fuel source.; The liver makes a large amount of glucose.; Fat is broken down too rapidly for the body to process."

It is caused when the pituitary gland makes too much GH. The pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland attached to the bottom of the brain. It controls, makes, and releases several hormones, including GH.; Usually, a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland releases too much GH. In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be inherited.; In children, too much GH causes gigantism rather than acromegaly."
000323,Alcoholic ketoacidosis,Ketoacidosis - alcoholic; Alcohol use - alcoholic ketoacidosis,"Symptoms of alcoholic ketoacidosis include:; Nausea and vomiting; Abdominal pain; Agitation, confusion; Changed level of alertness, which may lead to coma; Fatigue, slow movements; Deep, labored, rapid breathing; Loss of appetite; Symptoms of dehydration, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and thirst",Alcoholic ketoacidosis is caused by very heavy alcohol use.

000325,Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,Z-E syndrome; Gastrinoma,Symptoms may include:; Signs include ulcers in the stomach and small intestine.; Abdominal pain; Diarrhea; Vomiting blood (sometimes); Severe esophageal reflux (GERD) symptoms,Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by tumors. These growths are most often found in the head of the pancreas and the upper small intestine. The tumors are called gastrinomas. High levels of gastrin cause production of too much stomach acid.; Gastrinomas occur as single tumors or several tumors. One half to two thirds of single gastrinomas are cancerous (malignant) tumors. These tumors often spread to the liver and nearby lymph nodes.; Many people with gastrinomas have several tumors as part of a condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I). Tumors may develop in the pituitary gland (brain) and parathyroid gland (neck) as well as in the pancreas.
000326,Glucagonoma,MEN I - glucagonoma,"Symptoms of glucagonoma may include any of the following:; In most cases, the cancer has already spread to the liver when it is diagnosed.; Glucose intolerance (body has problem breaking down sugars); High blood sugar (hyperglycemia); Diarrhea; Excessive thirst (due to high blood sugar); Frequent urination (due to high blood sugar); Increased appetite; Inflamed mouth and tongue; Nighttime (nocturnal) urination; Skin rash on face, abdomen, buttocks, or feet that comes and goes, and moves around; Weight loss","Glucagonoma is usually cancerous (malignant). The cancer tends to spread and get worse if not treated.; This cancer affects some of the islet cells of the pancreas. As a result, the affected islet cells produce too much of the hormone glucagon.; The cause is unknown. Genetic factors play a role in some cases. A family history of the syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I) is a risk factor."
000327,Hemochromatosis,Iron overload; Blood transfusion - hemochromatosis,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Abdominal pain; Fatigue, lack of energy, weakness; Generalized darkening of skin color (often referred to as bronzing); Joint pain; Loss of body hair; Loss of sexual desire; Weight loss","Hemochromatosis may be a genetic disorder passed down through families.; Hemochromatosis may also occur as a result of:; This disorder affects more men than women.

Diagnosis may not occur until a person is over 20 or 30 years old.; Burgundy-colored urine (myoglobinuria); Fatigue; Exercise intolerance, poor stamina; Muscle cramps; Muscle pain; Muscle stiffness; Muscle weakness","GSD V is caused by a flaw in the gene that makes an enzyme called muscle glycogen phosphorylase. As a result, the body cannot break down glycogen in the muscles.; GSD V is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means to have the disorder, you must receive a copy of the nonworking gene from both parents. A person who receives a nonworking gene from only one parent usually does not develop this syndrome. A family history of GSD V increases the risk."
000330,Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism,Conn syndrome; Mineralocorticoid excess,"Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism have common symptoms, including:; High blood pressure; Low level of potassium in the blood; Feeling tired all the time; Headache; Muscle weakness; Numbness","Hyperaldosteronism occurs when the adrenal glands release too much aldosterone.; Primary hyperaldosteronism is due to a problem of the adrenal glands themselves. Most cases are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the adrenal gland.; Secondary hyperaldosteronism is due to a problem elsewhere in the body that causes the adrenal glands to release too much aldosterone. These problems can be with:; The condition mostly affects people 30 to 50 years old and is a common cause of high blood pressure in middle age.; Genes; Diet; Medical disorders such as with the heart, liver, kidneys, or high blood pressure"
000331,Thyroid cancer - papillary carcinoma,Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid; Papillary thyroid cancer; Papillary thyroid carcinoma,"Thyroid cancer often begins as a small lump (nodule) in the thyroid gland.; While some small lumps may be cancer, most (90%) thyroid nodules are harmless and are not cancerous.; Most of the time, there are no other symptoms.","About 85% of all thyroid cancers diagnosed in the United States are the papillary carcinoma type. It is more common in women than in men. It may occur in childhood, but is most often seen in adults between ages 20 and 60.; The cause of this cancer is not known. A genetic defect or family history of the disease may be a risk factor.; Radiation increases the risk for developing thyroid cancer. Exposure may occur from:; Radiation given through a vein (through an IV) during medical tests and treatments does not increase the risk for developing thyroid cancer.; High-dose external radiation treatments to the neck, especially during childhood, used to treat childhood cancer or some noncancerous childhood conditions; Radiation exposure from nuclear plant disasters"
000332,Milk-alkali syndrome,Calcium-alkali syndrome; Cope syndrome; Burnett syndrome; Hypercalcemia;Â Calcium metabolism disorder,"In the beginning, the condition usually has no symptoms (asymptomatic). When symptoms do occur, they can include:; Back, middle of the body, and low back pain in the kidney area (related to kidney stones); Confusion, strange behavior; Constipation; Depression; Excessive urination; Fatigue; Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia); Nausea or vomiting; Other symptoms that can result from kidney failure","Milk-alkali syndrome is almost always caused by taking too many calcium supplements, usually in the form of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is a common calcium supplement. It is often taken to prevent or treat bone loss (osteoporosis). Calcium carbonate is also an ingredient found in antacids (such as Tums).; A high level of vitamin D in the body, such as from taking supplements, can worsen milk-alkali syndrome.; Calcium deposits in the kidneys and in other tissues can occur in milk-alkali syndrome."
000333,Fanconi syndrome,De Toni-Fanconi-DebrÃ© syndrome,"Symptoms include:; Passing large amounts of urine, which can lead to dehydration; Excessive thirst; Severe bone pain; Fractures due to bone weakness; Muscle weakness","Fanconi syndrome can be caused by faulty genes, or it may result later in life due to kidney damage.

000334,Fanconi anemia,Fanconi's anemia; Anemia - Fanconi's,"People with Fanconi anemia have lower-than-normal numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets (cells that help the blood clot).; Too few white blood cells can lead to infections. A lack of red blood cells may result in fatigue (anemia).; A lower-than-normal amount of platelets may lead to excess bleeding.; Most people with Fanconi anemia have some of these symptoms:; Other possible symptoms:; Abnormal heart, lungs, and digestive tract; Bone problems (especially the hips, spine or ribs) can cause a curved spine (scoliosis); Changes in the color of the skin, such as darkened areas of the skin, called cafÃ© au lait spots, and vitiligo; Deafness due to abnormal ears; Eye or eyelid problems; Kidneys that did not form correctly; Problems with the arms and hands, such as missing, extra or misshapen thumbs, problems of the hands and the bone in the lower arm, and small or missing bone in the forearm; Short height; Small head; Small testicles and genital changes; Failure to thrive; Learning disability; Low birth weight; Intellectual disability","Fanconi anemia is due to an abnormal gene that damages cells, which keeps them from repairing damaged DNA.; To inherit Fanconi anemia, a person must get one copy of the abnormal gene from each parent.; The condition is most often diagnosed in children between 3 and 14 years old."
000335,Metabolic acidosis,Acidosis - metabolic,"Most symptoms are caused by the underlying disease or condition that is causing the metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis itself causes rapid and deep breathing as your body tries to compensate for it. Confusion or lethargy may also occur. Severe metabolic acidosis can lead to shock or death. In some situations, metabolic acidosis can be a mild, ongoing (chronic) condition.","Metabolic acidosis develops when too much acid is produced in the body. It can also occur when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body. There are several types of metabolic acidosis:; Lactic acidosis results from a buildup of lactic acid. Lactic acid is mainly produced in muscle cells and red blood cells. It forms when the body breaks down carbohydrates to use for energy when oxygen levels are low. It can be caused by:; Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled diabetes (usually type 1 diabetes).; Hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea.; Kidney disease (uremia, distal renal tubular acidosis or proximal renal tubular acidosis).; Lactic acidosis.; Poisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol.; Severe dehydration.; Cancer; Carbon monoxide poisoning; Drinking too much alcohol; Exercising vigorously for a very long time; Liver failure; Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia); Medicines, such as salicylates, metformin, anti-retrovirals; MELAS (a very rare genetic mitochondrial disorder that affects energy production); Prolonged lack of oxygen from shock, heart failure, or severe anemia; Seizures; Sepsis -- severe illness due to infection with bacteria or other germs; Severe asthma"

It makes up about 30% of all pituitary adenomas. Almost all pituitary tumors are noncancerous (benign). Prolactinoma may occur as part of an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1).; Prolactinomas occur most commonly in people under age 40. They are more common in women than in men and are rare in children.; At least half of all prolactinomas are very small (less than 3/8 of an inch or 1 centimeter [cm] in diameter). These small tumors occur more often in women and are called microprolactinomas.; Larger tumors are more common in men. They tend to occur at an older age. The tumor can grow to a large size before symptoms appear. Tumors larger than 3/8 inch (1 cm) in diameter are called macroprolactinomas.; The tumor is often detected at an earlier stage in young women than in men because the high prolactin causes irregular menstrual periods.
000338,von Gierke disease,Type I glycogen storage disease; von Gierke's disease,"These are symptoms of von Gierke disease:; Constant hunger and need to eat often; Easy bruising and nosebleeds; Fatigue; Irritability; Puffy cheeks, thin chest and limbs, and swollen belly","Von Gierke disease occurs when the body lacks the protein (enzyme) that releases glucose from glycogen. This causes abnormal amounts of glycogen to build up in certain tissues. When glycogen is not broken down properly, it leads to low blood sugar.; Von Gierke disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease."

This is because many foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in people who drink too much alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition. Excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store vitamin B1.; In rare cases, beriberi can be genetic. This condition is passed down through families. People with this condition lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time. The symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, this diagnosis is often missed. This is because health care providers may not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics.; Beriberi can occur in infants when they are:; Some medical treatments that can raise your risk of beriberi are:; Wet beriberi: Affects the cardiovascular system.; Dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: Affects the nervous system.; Breastfed and the mother's body is lacking in thiamine; Fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine; Getting dialysis; Taking high doses of diuretics (water pills)"

It usually develops in the center (medulla) of one or both adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are two triangle-shaped glands. One gland is located on top of each kidney. In rare cases, a pheochromocytoma occurs outside the adrenal gland. When it does, it is usually somewhere else in the abdomen.; Very few pheochromocytomas are cancerous.; The tumors may occur at any age, but they are most common from early to mid-adulthood.; In few instances, the condition may also be seen among family members (hereditary)."
000341,Bulimia,Bulimia nervosa; Binge-purge behavior; Eating disorder - bulimia,"With bulimia, eating binges may occur as often as several times a day for many months. The person often eats large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating.; Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include:; Purging often brings a sense of relief.; People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder.; Symptoms that other people can see include:; Forcing oneself to vomit; Excessive exercise; Using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills); Spending a lot of time exercising; Suddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away; Regularly going to the bathroom right after meals; Throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (medicines that cause vomiting), or diuretics","Many more women than men have bulimia.Â The disorder is most common in teenage girls and young women. The person usually knows that their eating pattern is abnormal. They may feel fear or guilt with the binge-purge episodes.; The exact cause of bulimia is unknown. Genetic, psychological, family, society, or cultural factors may play a role. Bulimia is likely due to more than one factor."

It can also occur if the body fails to absorb these nutrients.; Pellagra may also develop due to:; Pellagra is most common among poor and food-limited populations. The disease is more common in parts of the world (such as certain parts of Africa) where people have a lot of untreated corn in their diet. Corn is a poor source of tryptophan, and niacin in corn is tightly bound to other components of the grain. Niacin is released from corn if soaked in limewater overnight. This method is used to cook tortillas in Central America where pellagra is rare. Pellagra is rare in the United States and may be associated with severe alcoholism or medical causes of malnutrition.; Gastrointestinal diseases; Weight loss (bariatric) surgery; Anorexia; Excessive alcohol use; Carcinoid syndrome (group of symptoms associated with carcinoid tumors of the small intestine, colon, appendix, and bronchial tubes in the lungs); Certain medicines, such as isoniazid, 5-fluorouracil, 6-mercaptopurine, pyrazinamide, hydantoin, ethionamide, phenobarbital, azathioprine, and chloramphenicol"

It is attached by a stalk to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is the area of the brain that controls the pituitary gland's function.; The hormones released by the pituitary gland (and their functions) are:; In hypopituitarism, there is a lack of one or more pituitary hormones. Lack of a hormone leads to loss of function in the gland or organ the hormone controls. For example, lack of TSH leads to loss of normal function of the thyroid gland.; Hypopituitarism may be caused by:; Sometimes, hypopituitarism is due to uncommon immune system or metabolic diseases, such as:; Hypopituitarism is also a rare complication caused by severe bleeding during pregnancy. The loss of blood leads to tissue death in the pituitary gland. This condition is called Sheehan syndrome.; Certain medicines can also suppress pituitary function. The most common medicines are glucocorticoids (such as prednisone and dexamethasone), which are taken for inflammatory and immune conditions. Medicines used to treat prostate cancer can also lead to low pituitary function.; Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) -- stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol; cortisol helps to maintain blood pressure and blood sugar; Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) -- controls water loss by the kidneys; Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) -- controls sexual function and fertility in males and females; Growth hormone (GH) -- stimulates growth of tissues and bone; Luteinizing hormone (LH) -- controls sexual function and fertility in males and females; Oxytocin -- stimulates the uterus to contract during labor and the breasts to release milk; Prolactin -- stimulates female breast development and milk production; Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) -- stimulates the thyroid gland to release hormones that affect the body's metabolism; Brain surgery; Brain tumor; Head trauma (traumatic brain injury); Infections or inflammation of the brain and the tissues that support the brain; Death of an area of tissue in the pituitary gland (pituitary apoplexy); Radiation therapy to the brain; Stroke (rare); Subarachnoid hemorrhage (from a burst aneurysm); Tumors of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus; Too much iron in the body (hemochromatosis); Abnormal increase in immune cells called histiocytes (histiocytoses); Autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of the pituitary (lymphocytic hypophysitis); Sarcoidosis, a condition that causes inflammation of various tissues and organs; Infections of the pituitary, such as primary pituitary tuberculosis"
000344,Rickets,Osteomalacia in children; Vitamin D deficiency; Renal rickets; Hepatic rickets,"Symptoms of rickets include:; Bone pain or tenderness in the arms, legs, pelvis, and spine; Decreased muscle tone (loss of muscle strength) and weakness that gets worse; Dental deformities, including delayed tooth formation, defects in the tooth structure, holes in the enamel, and increased cavities (dental caries); Impaired growth; Increased bone fractures; Muscle cramps; Short stature (adults less than 5 feet or 1.52 meters tall); Skeletal deformities such as an odd-shaped skull, bowlegs, bumps in the ribcage (rachitic rosary), breastbone that is pushed forward (pigeon chest), pelvic deformities, and spine deformities (spine that curves abnormally, including scoliosis or kyphosis)","Vitamin D helps the body control calcium and phosphate levels. If the blood levels of these minerals become too low, the body may produce hormones that cause calcium and phosphate to be released from the bones. This leads to weak and soft bones.; Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D production by the skin may occur in people who:; You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you:; Infants who are breastfed only may develop vitamin D deficiency. Human breast milk does not supply the proper amount of vitamin D. This can be a particular problem for darker-skinned children in winter months. This is because there are lower levels of sunlight during these months.; Not getting enough calcium and phosphorous in your diet can also lead to rickets. Rickets caused by a lack of these minerals in the diet is rare in developed countries. Calcium and phosphorous are found in milk and green vegetables.; Your genes may increase your risk for rickets. Hereditary rickets is a form of the disease that is passed down through families. It occurs when the kidneys are unable to hold onto the mineral phosphate. Rickets may also be caused by kidney disorders that involve renal tubular acidosis.; Disorders that reduce the digestion or absorption of fats will make it more difficult for vitamin D to be absorbed into the body.; Sometimes, rickets may occur in children who have disorders of the liver. These children cannot convert vitamin D to its active form.; Rickets is rare in the United States. It is most likely to occur in children during periods of rapid growth. This is the age when the body needs high levels of calcium and phosphate. Rickets may also be seen in children ages 6 to 24 months. It is uncommon in newborns.; Live in climates with little exposure to sunlight; Must stay indoors; Work indoors during the daylight hours; Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products); DO NOT drink milk products; Follow a vegetarian diet"
000345,Craniopharyngioma,,"Craniopharyngioma causes symptoms by:; Increased pressure on the brain can cause:; Damage to the pituitary gland causes hormone imbalances that can lead to excessive thirst and urination, and slow growth.; When the optic nerve is damaged by the tumor, vision problems develop. These defects are often permanent. They may get worse after surgery to remove the tumor.; Behavioral and learning problems may be present.; Increasing pressure on the brain, usually from hydrocephalus; Disrupting hormone production by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland; Pressure or damage to the optic nerve; Headache; Nausea; Vomiting (especially in the morning); Change in appetite and weight; Confusion and drowsiness",The exact cause of the tumor is unknown.; This tumor most commonly affects children from 5 to 10 years of age. Adults can sometimes be affected. Boys and girls are equally likely to develop this tumor.
000346,Cystinuria,Stones - cystine; Cystine stones,"Symptoms include:; Blood in the urine; Flank pain or pain in the side or back. Pain is most often on one side. It is rarely felt on both sides. Pain is often severe. It may get worse over days. You may also feel pain in the pelvis, groin, genitals, or between the upper abdomen and back.","To have the symptoms of cystinuria, you must inherit a variant gene from both parents. Your children will also inherit a copy of the variant gene from you.; Cystinuria is caused by too much cystine in the urine. Normally, most cystine dissolves and returns to the bloodstream after entering the kidneys. People with cystinuria have a genetic change that interferes with this process. As a result, cystine builds up in the urine and forms crystals or stones. These crystals may get stuck in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder.; About one in every 7000 people have cystinuria. Cystine stones are most common in young adults under age 40. Less than 3% of urinary tract stones are cystine stones."
000347,Carcinoid syndrome,Flush syndrome; Argentaffinoma syndrome,"The carcinoid syndrome is made up of four main symptoms including:; Symptoms are sometimes brought on by physical exertion, or eating or drinking things such as blue cheese, chocolate, or red wine.; Flushing (face, neck, or upper chest), or widened blood vessels seen on the skin (telangiectasias); Difficulty breathing, such as wheezing; Diarrhea; Heart problems, such as leaking heart valves, slow heartbeat, low or high blood pressure","Carcinoid syndrome is the pattern of symptoms sometimes seen in people with carcinoid tumors. These tumors are rare, and often slow growing. Most carcinoid tumors are found in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs.; Carcinoid syndrome occurs in very few people with carcinoid tumors, after the tumor has spread to the liver or lung.; These tumors release too much of the hormoneÂ serotonin, as well as several other chemicals. The hormones cause the blood vessels to open (dilate). This causes carcinoid syndrome."
000348,Cushing disease,Pituitary Cushing disease;Â ACTH-secreting adenoma,"Symptoms of Cushing disease include:; Skin changes that are often seen include:; Muscle and bone changes include:; Women may have:; Men may have:; Other symptoms or problems may include:; Upper body obesity (above the waist) and thin arms and legs; Round, red, full face (moon face); Slow growth rate in children; Acne or skin infections; Purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide), called striae, on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, upper arms, and breasts; Thin skin with easy bruising, most commonly on the arms and hands; Backache, which occurs with routine activities; Bone pain or tenderness; Collection of fat between the shoulders (buffalo hump); Weakening of the bones, which leads to rib and spine fractures; Weak muscles causing exercise intolerance; Excess hair growth on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs; Menstrual cycle that becomes irregular or stops; Decreased or no desire for sex (low libido); Erection problems; Mental changes, such as depression, anxiety, or changes in behavior; Fatigue; Frequent infections; Headache; Increased thirst and urination; High blood pressure; Diabetes (high blood sugar)","Cushing disease is caused by a tumor or excess growth (hyperplasia) of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is located just below the base of the brain. A type of pituitary tumor called an adenoma is the most common cause. An adenoma is a benign tumor (not a cancer).; With Cushing disease, the pituitary gland releases too much ACTH. ACTH stimulates production and release of cortisol, a stress hormone. Too much ACTH causes the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol.; Cortisol is normally released during stressful situations. It also has many other functions, including:; Controlling the body's use of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins; Reducing the immune system's response to swelling (inflammation); Regulating blood pressure and the body's water balance"
000349,Empty sella syndrome,Pituitary - empty sella syndrome; Partial empty sella,"Often, there are no symptoms or loss of pituitary function.; If there are symptoms, they may include any of the following:; Erection problems; Headaches; Irregular or absent menstruation; Decreased orÂ no desire for sex (low libido); Fatigue, low energy; Nipple discharge","The pituitary is a small gland located just underneath the brain. It is attached to the bottom of the brain by the pituitary stalk. The pituitary sits protected inside a saddle-like bony compartment in the base of the skull. This compartment is called the sella turcica, but often just called the sella.; When the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened, it cannot be seen on an MRI scan. This makes the area of the pituitary gland look like an ""empty sella."" But the sella is not actually empty. It is often filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. With empty sella syndrome, CSF has leaked into the sella turcica, putting pressure on the pituitary. This causes the gland to shrink or flatten.; Primary empty sella syndrome occurs when one of the layers (arachnoid) covering the outside of the brain bulges down into the sella and presses on the pituitary.; Secondary empty sella syndrome occurs when the sella is empty because the pituitary gland has been damaged by:; Empty sella syndrome may be seen in a condition called pseudotumor cerebri, which mainly affects young, obese women and causes the CSF to be under higher pressure.; The pituitary gland makes several hormones that control other glands and hormones in the body, including:; A problem with the pituitary gland can lead to problems with any of the above glands and abnormal hormone levels of these glands.; A tumor; Radiation therapy; Surgery; Trauma; Adrenal glands; Liver hormone related to growth (insulin-like growth factor-1); Ovaries; Testicles; Thyroid"

Many foods contain vitamin A, including:; Some dietary supplements also contain vitamin A.; Taking too many supplements is the most common cause of vitamin A toxicity. It tends not to occur just from eating vitamin A-rich foods.; Too much vitamin A can make you sick. Taking large doses during pregnancy can cause birth defects.; Meat, fish, and egg yolks; Dairy products; Some fruits and vegetables; Acute vitamin A poisoning occurs quickly. It can happen when an adult takes several hundred thousand international units (IUs) of vitamin A.; Chronic vitamin A poisoning may occur over time in adults who regularly take more than 25,000 IUs a day.; Babies and children are more sensitive to vitamin A. They can become sick after taking smaller doses of it. Swallowing products that contain vitamin A, such as skin cream with retinol in it, can also cause vitamin A poisoning."
000351,Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome; Benign intracranial hypertension,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Headaches may get worse during physical activity, especially when you tighten the stomach muscles during coughing or straining.; Headaches, throbbing, daily, irregular and worse in the morning; Neck pain; Blurred vision; Buzzing sound in the ears (tinnitus); Dizziness; Double vision (diplopia); Nausea, vomiting; Vision problems such as flashing lights or even loss of vision; Low back pain, radiating along both legs","The condition occurs more often in women than men, especially in young obese women 20 to 40 years old.

The vitamin helps form red and white blood cells. It also helps produce DNA, the building block of the human body, which carries genetic information.; Folic acid is a water-soluble type of vitamin B. This means it is not stored in the fat tissues of the body. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine.; Because folate is not stored in the body in large amounts, your blood levels will get low after only a few weeks of eating a diet low in folate. Folate is found primarily in legumes, leafy greens, eggs, beets, bananas, citrus fruits, and liver.; Contributors to folate deficiency include:; Diseases in which folic acid is not well absorbed in the digestive system (such as celiac disease or Crohn disease); Drinking too much alcohol; Eating overcooked fruits and vegetables. Folic acid can be easily destroyed by heat.; Hemolytic anemia; Certain medicines (such as phenytoin, sulfasalazine, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); Eating a diet that does not include enough fruits and vegetables; Kidney dialysis"

They are made up of an outer portion called the cortex, and an inner portion called the medulla.; The cortex produces 3 hormones:; The medulla produces the hormone adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Both cortisol and adrenaline are released in response to stress.; Cortisol production is regulated by the pituitary. This is a small gland just underneath the brain. The pituitary releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This is a hormone that causes the adrenal glands to release cortisol.; Adrenaline production is regulated by nerves coming from the brain and spinal cord and by circulating hormones.; Adrenal crisis can occur from any of the following:; Glucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol) maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress) immune response, and help the body respond to stress.; Mineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone) regulate sodium, water and potassium balance.; Sex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female), affect sexual development and sex drive.; The adrenal gland is damaged due to, for example, Addison disease or other adrenal gland disease, or surgery; The pituitary is injured and cannot release ACTH (hypopituitarism); Adrenal insufficiency is not properly treated; You've been taking glucocorticoid medicines for a long time, and suddenly stop; You've become very dehydrated; Infection or other physical stress"

The gland is located at the front of the neck above where the collarbones meet. This gland releases the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which control body metabolism. Controlling metabolism is important for regulating mood, weight, and mental and physical energy levels.; When the body makes too much thyroid hormone, the condition is called hyperthyroidism. (An underactive thyroid leads to hypothyroidism.); Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is due to an abnormal immune system response that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Graves disease is most common in women over age 20. But the disorder can occur at any age and can affect men as well."
000359,Hereditary fructose intolerance,"Fructosemia; Fructose intolerance; Fructose aldolase B-deficiency; Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase deficiency","Symptoms can be seen after a baby starts eating food or formula.; The early symptoms of fructose intolerance are similar to those of galactosemia (inability to use the sugar galactose). Later symptoms relate more to liver disease.; Symptoms may include:; Convulsions; Excessive sleepiness; Irritability; Yellow skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice); Poor feeding and growth as a baby, failure to thrive; Problems after eating fruits and other foods that contain fructose or sucrose; Vomiting","This condition occurs when the body is missing an enzyme called aldolase B. This substance is needed to break down fructose.; If a person without this substance eats fructose or sucrose (cane or beet sugar, table sugar), complicated chemical changes occur in the body. The body cannot change its stored form of sugar (glycogen) into glucose. As a result, blood sugar falls and dangerous substances build up in the liver.; Hereditary fructose intolerance is inherited, which means it can be passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the aldolase B gene, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected."
000360,Osteoporosis,Thin bones; Low bone density; Metabolic bone disease; Hip fracture - osteoporosis; Compression fracture - osteoporosis; Wrist fracture - osteoporosis,"There are no symptoms in the early stages of osteoporosis.

These are called compression fractures. They often occur without an injury. The pain may occur suddenly or slowly over time.; There can be a loss of height (as much as 6 inches or 15 centimeters) over time. A stooped posture or a condition called a dowager's hump may develop.","Osteoporosis is the most common type of bone disease.; Osteoporosis increases the risk for breaking a bone. About one half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebrae (bones of the spine) during their lifetime. Spine fractures are the most common.; Your body needs the minerals calcium and phosphate to make and keep healthy bones.; Sometimes, bone loss occurs without any known cause. Other times, bone loss and thin bones run in families. In general, white, older women are the most likely to have bone loss.; Brittle, fragile bones can be caused by anything that makes your body reabsorb too much bone, or keeps your body from making enough new bone. As you age, your body may reabsorb calcium and phosphate from your bones instead of keeping these minerals in your bones. This makes your bones weaker.; A major risk is not consuming enough calcium to build new bone tissue. It is important to eat/drink enough high-calcium foods. You also need vitamin D, because it helps your body absorb calcium. Your bones may become brittle and more likely to fracture if:; Other causes of bone loss include:; Other risk factors include:; During your life, your body continues to both reabsorb old bone and create new bone.; As long as your body has a good balance of new and old bone, your bones stay healthy and strong.; Bone loss occurs when more old bone is reabsorbed than new bone is created.; If you do not eat enough food with calcium and vitamin D; Your body does not absorb enough calcium and vitamin D from your food, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to other medical conditions; A decrease in estrogen in women at the time of menopause and a decrease in testosterone in men as they age; Being confined to a bed due to a prolonged illness (mostly affects bones in children); Having certain medical conditions that cause increased inflammation in the body such as Crohn disease or rheumatoid arthritis; Taking certain medicines, such as certain seizure medicines, hormone treatments for prostate or breast cancer, and steroid medicines taken for more than 3 months; Absence of menstrual periods for long periods of time; A family history of osteoporosis; Drinking a large amount of alcohol; Low body weight; Smoking; Having an eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosa; Certain ethnic groups have a higher rate of low bone mass"

Inflammation in the lining of the abdominal cavity, chest cavity, skin, or joints occurs along with high fevers that usually peak in 12 to 24 hours. Attacks may vary in severity of symptoms. People are usually symptom-free between attacks.; Symptoms may include repeated episodes of:; Abdominal pain; Chest pain that is sharp and gets worse when taking a breath; Fever or alternating chills and fever; Joint pain; Skin sores (lesions) that are red and swollen and range from 5 to 20 centimeters (cm) in diameter","FMF is most often caused by a variation in a gene named MEFV. This gene creates a protein involved in regulating inflammation. The disease usually appears only in people who received two copies of the variant gene, one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance or an autosomal recessive condition.; FMF most often affects people of Mediterranean ancestry. These include non-Ashkenazi (Sephardic) Jews, Armenians, and Arabs. People from other ethnic groups can also be affected."

PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and is important for bone health.; If you have PHP, your body produces the right amount of PTH, but is resistant to its effect. This causes low blood calcium levels and high blood phosphate levels.; PHP is caused by abnormal genes. There are different types of PHP. All forms are rare and are usually diagnosed in childhood.; Type 1a is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. That means only one parent needs to pass you the variant gene for you to have the condition. It is also called Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. The condition causes short stature, round face, obesity, developmental delay, and short hand bones. Symptoms depend on whether you inherit the gene from your mother or father.; Type 1b involves resistance to PTH only in the kidneys. Less is known about type 1b than type 1a. Calcium in the blood is low, but there are none of the other characteristic features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.; Type 2 also involves low blood calcium and high blood phosphate levels. People with this form do not have the physical traits common to people with Type 1a. The genetic abnormality that causes it is not known. It is different from Type 1b in how the kidney responds to high PTH levels."

This excess occurs due to:; Calcium blood level may also be high if your body is low on fluids or water.; Other conditions can also cause hypercalcemia:; Men and women of all ages can have a high blood calcium level. However, it is most common in women over age 50 (after menopause). In most cases, this is due to an overactive parathyroid gland.; PTH is made by the parathyroid glands. These are four small glands located in the neck behind the thyroid gland.; Vitamin D is obtained when the skin is exposed to sunlight, and from food sources or supplements.; An enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands.; A growth on one of the glands. Most of the time, these growths are benign (not a cancer).; Certain kinds of cancers, such as lung and breast cancer, or cancer that has spread to your organs.; Too much vitamin D in your blood (hypervitaminosis D).; Being immobile in bed for many days or weeks (mostly in children).; Too much calcium in your diet.

They may develop a serious blood infection with the bacteria E coli.; Symptoms of galactosemia are:; Convulsions; Irritability; Lethargy; Poor feeding -- baby refuses to eat formula containing milk; Poor weight gain; Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice); Vomiting,"Galactosemia is an inherited disorder. This means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene that can cause galactosemia, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected with it.; There are 3 forms of the disease:; People with galactosemia are unable to fully break down the simple sugar galactose. Galactose makes up one half of lactose, the sugar found in milk.; If an infant with galactosemia is given milk, substances made from galactose build up in the infant's system. These substances damage the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes.; People with galactosemia cannot tolerate any form of milk (human or animal). They must be careful about eating other foods containing galactose.; Galactose-1 phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) deficiency: Classic galactosemia, the most common and most severe form; Deficiency of galactose kinase (GALK); Deficiency of galactose-6-phosphate epimerase (GALE)"
000368,Hereditary amyloidosis,Amyloidosis - hereditary; Familial amyloidosis,,Hereditary amyloidosis is passed down from parents to their children (inherited). Genes may also play a role in primary amyloidosis.; Other types of amyloidosis are not inherited. They include:; Specific conditions include:; Senile systemic: seen in people older than 70; Spontaneous: occurs without a known cause; Secondary: results from diseases such as cancer of certain blood cells (myeloma); Cardiac amyloidosis; Cerebral amyloidosis; Secondary systemic amyloidosis
000369,Polycystic ovary syndrome,Polycystic ovaries; Polycystic ovary disease; Stein-Leventhal syndrome; Polyfollicular ovarian disease; PCOS,"Symptoms of PCOS include changes in the menstrual cycle, such as:; Other symptoms of PCOS include:; The development of male characteristics is not typical of PCOS and may indicate another problem. The following changes may indicate another problem apart from PCOS:; Not getting a period after you have had one or more normal ones during puberty (secondary amenorrhea); Irregular periods that may come and go, and be very light to very heavy; Extra body hair that grows on the chest, belly, face, and around the nipples; Acne on the face, chest, or back; Skin changes, such as dark or thick skin markings and creases around the armpits, groin, neck, and breasts; Thinning hair on the head at the temples, called male pattern baldness; Enlargement of the clitoris; Deepening of the voice; Decrease in breast size","PCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are:; Normally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.; In many women with PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid (cyst) around them. The affected ovary may be slightly enlarged. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance.; Women with PCOS have cycles where ovulation does not occur every month which may contribute to infertility The other symptoms of this disorder are due to the high levels of male hormones.; Most of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start. Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms.; Estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs; Androgen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women"

It can occur at any age, but is most often seen in middle-aged women. It is caused by a reaction of the immune system against the thyroid gland.; The disease begins slowly. It may take months or even years for the condition to be detected and for thyroid hormone levels to become lower than normal. Hashimoto disease is most common in people with a family history of thyroid disease.; In rare cases, the disease may be related to other hormone problems caused by the immune system. It can occur with poor adrenal function and type 1 diabetes. In these cases, the condition is called type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA II).; Rarely (usually in children), Hashimoto disease occurs as part of a condition called type 1 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA I), along with:; Poor function of the adrenal glands; Fungal infections of the mouth and nails; Underactive parathyroid gland"
000372,Hereditary urea cycle abnormality,Abnormality of the urea cycle - hereditary; Urea cycle - hereditary abnormality,"Typically, an affected baby begins nursing well and seems normal. However, over time the baby develops poor feeding, vomiting, and sleepiness, which may be so deep that the baby is difficult to awaken. This most often occurs within the first week after birth.; Symptoms include:; Confusion; Decreased food intake; Dislike of foods that contain proteinÂ; Increased sleepiness, difficulty waking up; Nausea, vomiting","The urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body.; The liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.; Several inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder have a defective gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body.; These diseases include:; As a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns. OTC deficiency is the most common of these disorders.; Because this is an X-linked condition, boys are more often affected by OTC deficiency than girls. Girls are rarely affected with OTC. Those girls who are affected have milder symptoms and can develop the disease later in life. Because they are autosomal recessive conditions, the other conditions that cause this problem affect both girls and boys equally.; To get the other types of disorders, you need to receive a non-working copy of the gene from both parents. Sometimes parents don't know they carry a non-working copy of the gene until their child gets the disorder.; Argininosuccinic aciduria; Arginase deficiency; Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency; Citrullinemia; N-acetylglutamate synthetase (NAGS) deficiency; Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency"
000373,Maple syrup urine disease,MSUD,Symptoms of this disorder include:; Coma; Feeding difficulties; Lethargy; Seizures; Urine that smells like maple syrup; Vomiting,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. It is caused by a defect in 1 of 3 genes. People with this condition cannot break down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. This leads to a buildup of these chemicals in the blood.; In the most severe form, MSUD can damage the brain during times of physical stress (such as infection, fever, or not eating for a long time).; Some types of MSUD are mild or come and go. Even in the mildest form, repeated periods of physical stress can cause intellectualÂ disability and high levels of leucine to build up."
000374,Thyroid cancer - medullary carcinoma,Thyroid - medullary carcinoma; Cancer - thyroid (medullary carcinoma); MTC; Thyroid nodule - medullary,"MTC often begins as a small lump (nodule) in the thyroid gland. There also may be lymph node swelling in the neck. As a result, symptoms may include:; Swelling of the neck; Hoarseness; Breathing problems due to narrowing of airways; Cough; Cough with blood; Diarrhea due to high calcitonin level","The cause of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC) is unknown. MTC is very rare. It can occur in children and adults.; Unlike other types of thyroid cancer, MTC is less likely to be caused by radiation therapy to the neck given to treat other cancers during childhood.; There are two forms of MTC:; You have an increased risk for this type of cancer if you have:; Other types of thyroid cancer include:; Sporadic MTC, which does not run in families. Most MTCs are sporadic. This form mainly affects older adults.; Hereditary MTC, which runs in families.; A family history of MTC; A family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN); A prior history of pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, hyperparathyroidism or pancreatic endocrine tumors; Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid; Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid; Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid; Thyroid lymphoma"
000375,Subacute thyroiditis,De Quervain's thyroiditis; Subacute nonsuppurative thyroiditis; Giant cell thyroiditis; Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis; Hyperthyroidism - subacute thyroiditis,"The most obvious symptom of subacute thyroiditis is pain in the neck caused by a swollen and inflamed thyroid gland. Sometimes, the pain can spread (radiate) to the jaw or ears. The thyroid gland may be painful and swollen for weeks or, in rare cases, months.; Other symptoms include:; The inflamed thyroid gland may release too much thyroid hormone, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including:; As the thyroid gland heals, it may release too little hormone, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism, including:; Thyroid gland function often returns to normal over a few months. During this time you may need treatment for your underactive thyroid. In rare cases, hypothyroidism may be permanent.; Tenderness when gentle pressure is applied to the thyroid gland; Difficulty or painful swallowing, hoarseness; Fatigue, feeling weak; Fever; More frequent bowel movements; Hair loss; Heat intolerance; Irregular (or very light) menstrual periods in women; Mood changes; Nervousness, shaking hands (tremors); Palpitations; Sweating; Weight loss, but with increased appetite; Cold intolerance; Constipation; Fatigue; Irregular (or heavy) menstrual periods in women; Weight gain; Dry skin; Mood changes","Subacute thyroiditis is an uncommon condition. It is thought to be the result of a viral infection. The condition often occurs a few weeks after a viral infection of the ear, sinus, or throat, such as mumps, the flu, or a common cold.; Subacute thyroiditis occurs most often in middle-aged women with symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection in the past month."
000376,Osteomalacia,Vitamin D deficiency - osteomalacia; Calcium - osteomalacia,"Symptoms include:; Symptoms may also occur due to a low calcium level. These include:; Bone fractures that happen without a significant injury; Muscle weakness; Widespread bone pain, especially in the hips; Numbness around the mouth; Numbness or tingling of the arms and legs; Spasms or cramps of the hands or feet","A lack of the proper amount of calcium in the blood can lead to weak and soft bones. Low blood calcium can be caused by low vitamin D level in the blood.; Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D produced by the skin may occur in people who:; You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you:; Other conditions that may cause osteomalacia include:; Live in climates with little exposure to sunlight; Must stay indoors; Work indoors during the daylight hours; Wear clothes that cover most of their skin; Have dark skin pigmentation; Use very strong sunscreen; Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products); Do not eat or drink milk products (more common in older adults); Follow a vegetarian diet; Are not able to absorb vitamin D well in the intestines, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to a gastrointestinal disease; Cancer -- rare tumors that cause low phosphate level in the blood; Kidney failure and acidosis; Lack of enough phosphates in the diet; Liver disease -- the liver cannot convert vitamin D to its active form; Side effects of medicines used to treat seizures"

Normally, most of the water is reabsorbed, and only a small amount of concentrated urine, relative to the volume of blood, is excreted. DI occurs when your kidneys cannot concentrate the urine normally, and a large amount of dilute urine is excreted.; The amount of water excreted in the urine is controlled by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland just below the base of the brain.; DI caused by a lack of ADH is called central diabetes insipidus. When DI is caused by a failure of the kidneys to respond to ADH, the condition is called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic means related to the kidney.; Central DI is rare. It can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland as a result of:; Nephrogenic DI involves a defect in the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys do not respond to ADH. Nephrogenic DI is very rare. Nephrogenic DI may be caused by:; Genetic problems; Head injury (common cause); Infection in the brain; Problem with the ADH-producing cells due to an autoimmune disease; Loss of blood supply to the pituitary gland; Surgery in the area of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus (most common cause); Tumors in or near the pituitary gland; Certain medicines, such as lithium; Genetic problems; High level of calcium in the body (hypercalcemia); Kidney disease, such as polycystic kidney disease"
000378,Addison disease,Adrenocortical hypofunction; Chronic adrenocortical insufficiency; Primary adrenal insufficiency; Addison's disease,"Symptoms of Addison disease may include any of the following:; Symptoms may not be present all the time.

They are made up of an outer portion, called the cortex, and an inner portion, called the medulla.; The cortex produces 3 hormones:; Addison disease results from damage to the adrenal cortex. The damage causes the cortex to produce hormone levels that are too low.; This damage may be caused by the following:; Risk factors for the autoimmune type of Addison disease include other autoimmune diseases:; Certain rare genetic defects may also cause adrenal insufficiency.; Glucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol) maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress) immune response, and help the body respond to stress.; Mineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone) regulate sodium, water and potassium balance.; Sex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female), affect sexual development and sex drive.; The immune system mistakenly attacking the adrenal glands (autoimmune disease); Infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, or fungal infections; Hemorrhage into the adrenal glands; Tumors; Swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland that often results in reduced thyroid function (chronic thyroiditis); Thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (overactive thyroid, Graves disease); Itchy rash with bumps and blisters (dermatitis herpetiformis); Parathyroid glands in the neck do not produce enough parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism); Pituitary gland does not produce normal amounts of some or all of its hormones (hypopituitarism); Autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves and the muscles they control (myasthenia gravis); Body does not have enough healthy red blood cells (pernicious anemia); Testicles cannot produce sperm or male hormones (testicular failure); Type I diabetes; Loss of brown color (pigment) from areas of the skin (vitiligo)"
000379,Turner syndrome,Bonnevie-Ullrich syndrome; Gonadal dysgenesis; Monosomy X; XO,"Possible findings of the head and neck include:; Other findings may include:; A child with Turner syndrome is much shorter than children who are the same age and sex. This is called short stature. This problem may not be noticed in girls before age 11.; Puberty may be absent or not complete. If puberty occurs, it most often begins at the normal age. After the age of puberty, unless treated with female hormones, these findings may be present:; Sometimes, the diagnosis of Turner syndrome may not be made until adulthood. It may be discovered because a woman has very light or no menstrual periods and problems becoming pregnant.; Ears are low-set.; Neck appears wide or web-like.; Roof of the mouth is narrow (high palate).; Hairline at the back of the head is lower.; Lower jaw is lower and appears to fade away (recede).; Drooping eyelids and dry eyes.; Fingers and toes are short.; Hands and feet are swollen in infants.; Nails are narrow and turn upward.; Chest is broad and flat.; Nipples appear more widely spaced.; Height at birth is often smaller than average.; Pubic hair is often present and normal.; Breast development may not occur.; Menstrual periods are absent or very light.; Vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse are common.; Infertility.","The typical number of human chromosomes is 46. Chromosomes contain all of your genes and DNA, the building blocks of the body. Two of these chromosomes, the sex chromosomes, determine if you become a boy or a girl.; In Turner syndrome, cells are missing all or part of an X chromosome. The condition only occurs in females. Most commonly, a female with Turner syndrome has only 1 X chromosome. Others may have 2 X chromosomes, but one of them is incomplete. Sometimes, a female has some cells with 2 X chromosomes, but other cells have only 1. This situation is called mosaicism.; Females typically have 2 of the same sex chromosomes, written as XX.; Males have an X and a Y chromosome (written as XY)."
000380,Prostate cancer,Cancer - prostate; Biopsy - prostate; Prostate biopsy; Gleason score,"With early prostate cancer, there are often no symptoms.; The PSA blood test may be done to screen men for prostate cancer. Often, the PSA level rises before there are any symptoms.; The symptoms listed below can occur with prostate cancer as it grows larger in the prostate. These symptoms can also be caused by other prostate problems:; When the cancer has spread, there may be bone pain or tenderness, most often in the lower back and pelvic bones.; Delayed or slowed start of urinary stream; Dribbling or leakage of urine, most often after urinating; Slow urinary stream; Straining when urinating, or not being able to empty all of the urine; Blood in the urine or semen","Prostate cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in men over age 75. Prostate cancer is rarely found in men younger than 40.; People who are at high risk include:; Other people at risk include:; Prostate cancer is less common in people who do not eat meat (vegetarians).; A common problem in almost all men as they grow older is an enlarged prostate that affects their urinary function. This is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It does not raise your risk for prostate cancer. But, it can increase your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test result.; African American men, who are also more likely to develop this cancer at every age; Men age 60 years and above; Men who have a father or brother with prostate cancer; Men who have been exposed to Agent Orange; Men who eat a diet high in fat, especially animal fat; Obese men"

Symptoms may include:; Dribbling at the end of urinating; Inability to urinate (urinary retention); Incomplete emptying of your bladder; Incontinence; Needing to urinate 2 or more times per night; Pain with urination or bloody urine (these may indicate infection); Slowed or delayed start of the urinary stream; Straining to urinate; Strong and sudden urge to urinate; Weak urine stream,"The actual cause of prostate enlargement is unknown. Factors linked to aging and changes in the cells of the testicles may have a role in the growth of the gland, as well as testosterone levels. Men who have had their testicles removed at a young age (for example, as a result of testicular cancer) do not develop BPH.; Also, if the testicles are removed after a man develops BPH, the prostate begins to shrink in size. However, this is not a standard treatment for an enlarged prostate.; Some facts about prostate enlargement:; The likelihood of developing an enlarged prostate increases with age.; BPH is so common that it has been said all men will have an enlarged prostate if they live long enough.; A small amount of prostate enlargement is present in many men over age 40. More than 90% of men over age 80 have the condition.; No risk factors have been identified, other than having normally-functioning testicles."

Chromosomes contain all of your genes and DNA, the building blocks of the body. The 2 sex chromosomes (X and Y) determine the genetic sex of a child.Â The genetic sex of a child is determined at conception. The mother's egg cell contains an X chromosome, while the father's sperm cell contains either an X or a Y chromosome.; Normally, an infant inherits 1 pair of sex chromosomes, 1 X from the mother and 1 X or 1 Y from the father. A baby who inherits the X chromosome from the father is a genetic female and has 2 X chromosomes. A baby who inherits the Y chromosome from the father is a genetic male and has 1 X and 1 Y chromosome.Â; Klinefelter syndrome results when a male child is born with at least 1 extra X chromosome. They have 47 chromosomes instead of 46. This is written as 47, XXY.; Klinefelter syndrome occurs as a random event. There is no exact cause, and the condition is not inherited.Â; Klinefelter syndrome occurs in about 1 out of 500 to 1,000 male infants. Women who get pregnant after age 35 are slightly more likely to have a male child with this syndrome than younger women."
000385,Hypoparathyroidism,Parathyroid-related hypocalcemia,"Onset of the disease is very gradual and symptoms can be mild. Many people diagnosed with hypoparathyroidism have had symptoms for years before they are diagnosed. Symptoms may be so mild that the diagnosis is made after a screening blood test that shows low calcium.; Symptoms may include any of the following:; Tingling lips, fingers, and toes (most common); Muscle cramps (most common); Muscle spasms called tetany (can affect the larynx, causing breathing difficulties); Abdominal pain; Abnormal heart rhythm; Brittle nails; Cataracts; Calcium deposits in some tissuesÂ; Decreased consciousness; Dry hair; Dry, scaly skin; Pain in the face, legs, and feet; Painful menstruation; Seizures; Teeth that do not grow in on time, or at all; Weakened tooth enamel (in children)","There are 4 tiny parathyroid glands in the neck, located near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland.; The parathyroid glands help regulate calcium absorption, use, and removal by the body. They do this by producing PTH. PTH helps control calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones.; Hypoparathyroidism occurs when the glands produce too little PTH. The blood calcium level falls, and the phosphorus level rises.; The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is injury to the parathyroid glands during thyroid or neck surgery. It may also be caused by any of the following:; DiGeorge syndrome is a disease in which hypoparathyroidism occurs because all the parathyroid glands are missing at birth. This disease includes other health problems besides hypoparathyroidism. It is usually diagnosed in childhood.; Familial hypoparathyroidism occurs with other endocrine diseases such as adrenal insufficiency in a syndrome called type I polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA I).; Autoimmune attack on the parathyroid glands (common); Very low magnesium level in the blood (reversible); Radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism (very rare)"
000386,Low blood sugar,Hypoglycemia; Insulin shock; Insulin reaction; Diabetes - hypoglycemia,"Symptoms you may have when your blood sugar gets too low include:; In many people with diabetes, low blood sugar causes nearly the same symptoms every time it happens. Not everybody feels low blood sugar symptoms the same way.; Some symptoms, like hunger or sweating, occur when blood sugar is only slightly low. More severe symptoms, such as unclear thinking or seizure, may occur when the blood sugar is much lower (less than 54 mg/dL or 3.0 mmol/L).; Even if you do not have symptoms, your blood sugar could still be too low (called hypoglycemic unawareness). You may not even know you have low blood sugar until you faint, have a seizure, or go into a coma. If you have diabetes, ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low to help prevent a medical emergency. Some continuous glucose monitors can alert you and other people that you designate when your blood sugar decreases below a set level.; If you have diabetes, keeping good control of your blood sugar can help prevent low blood sugar. Talk to your provider if you're not sure about the causes and symptoms of low blood sugar.; Double vision or blurry vision; Fast or pounding heartbeat; Feeling cranky or acting aggressive; Feeling nervous; Headache; Hunger; Seizures; Shaking or trembling; Sweating; Tingling or numbness of the skin; Tiredness or weakness; Trouble sleeping; Unclear thinking","Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells where it is stored or used for energy. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the blood instead of going into the cells. This leads to symptoms of diabetes.; Low blood sugar occurs due to any of the following:; Low blood sugar is common in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. However, many other diabetes medicines do not cause low blood sugar.; Exercise can also lead to low blood sugar in people taking insulin to treat their diabetes.; Babies born to mothers with diabetes may have severe drops in blood sugar right after birth.; In people who do not have diabetes, low blood sugar may be caused by:; Your body's glucose is used up too quickly; Glucose production by the body is too low or it is released into the bloodstream too slowly; Too much insulin is in the bloodstream; Drinking alcohol; Insulinoma, which is a rare tumor in the pancreas that produces too much insulin; Lack of a hormone, such as cortisol, growth hormone, or thyroid hormone; Severe heart, kidney, or liver failure; Infection that affects the whole body (sepsis); Some types of weight-loss surgery (usually 5 or more years after the surgery); Medicines not used to treat diabetes (certain antibiotics or heart medicines)"

Symptoms may include:; Anxiety, behavior changes, or confusion; Clouded vision; Loss of consciousness or coma; Convulsions or tremor; Dizziness or headache; Hunger between meals; weight gain is common; Fast heart rate or palpitations; Sweating","The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen. The pancreas makes several enzymes and hormones, including the hormone insulin. Insulin's job is to reduce the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood by helping sugar move into cells.; Most of the time when your blood sugar level decreases, the pancreas stops making insulin to make sure that your blood sugar stays in the normal range. Tumors of the pancreas that produce too much insulin are called insulinomas. Insulinomas keep making insulin, and can make your blood sugar level too low (hypoglycemia).; A high blood insulin level causes a low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia). Hypoglycemia may be mild, leading to symptoms such as anxiety and hunger. Or it can be severe, leading to seizures, coma, and even death.; Insulinomas are very rare tumors. They usually occur as single, small tumors. But there can also be several small tumors.; Most insulinomas are non-cancerous (benign) tumors. People with certain genetic disorders, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type I, are at higher risk for insulinomas."

These symptoms may last for up to 3 months.; Symptoms are often mild, and may include:; Later symptoms may be of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), including:; These symptoms can persist until the thyroid recovers normal function. The recovery of the thyroid can take many months in some people. Some people only notice the hypothyroid symptoms and do not have symptoms of hyperthyroidism to begin with.; Fatigue, feeling weak; Frequent bowel movements; Heat intolerance; Increased appetite; Increased sweating; Irregular menstrual periods; Mood changes, such as irritability; Muscle cramps; Nervousness, restlessness; Palpitations; Weight loss; Fatigue; Constipation; Dry skin; Irregular (or heavy) menstrual periods in women; Mood changes; Weight gain; Cold intolerance","The cause of the disease is unknown. But it is related to an attack against the thyroid by the immune system. The disease affects women more often than men.; The disease can occur in women who have just had a baby. It can also be caused by medicines such as interferon and amiodarone, and some types of chemotherapy, which affect the immune system."

This hormone is normally made in the adrenal glands.; Exogenous means caused by something outside the body. Exogenous Cushing syndrome occurs when a person takes man-made (synthetic) glucocorticoid medicines to treat a disease. These medicines act like cortisol in the body.; Glucocorticoids are given for many diseases, such as lung diseases, skin conditions, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, brain tumors, and joint disease. These medicines come in many forms, including pill, intravenous (IV), injection into a joint, enema, skin creams, inhalers, and eye drops."
000390,Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism,Gonadotropin deficiency; Secondary hypogonadism,"Children:; Adults:; Lack of growth and sexual development at the standard age for puberty (development may be very late or incomplete); In girls, a lack of breast development and menstrual periods; In boys, no development of sex characteristics, such as enlargement of the testes and penis, deepening of the voice, and facial hair; Inability to smell (in some cases); Short stature (in some cases); Loss of interest in sex (libido) in men; Loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) in women; Decreased energy and interest in activities; Loss of muscle mass in men; Weight gain; Mood changes; Infertility","HH is caused by a lack of hormones that normally stimulate the ovaries or testes. These hormones include:; Normally:; There are several causes of HH:; Kallmann syndrome is an inherited form of HH. Some people with this condition also lose their sense of smell (anosmia).; Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH); Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH); Luteinizing hormone (LH); The hypothalamus in the brain releases GnRH.; This hormone stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH.; These hormones tell the female ovaries or the male testes to release hormones that lead to normal sexual development in puberty, normal menstrual cycles, estrogen levels and fertility in adult women, and normal testosterone production and sperm production in adult men.; Any change in this hormone release chain causes a lack of sex hormones. This prevents normal sexual maturity in children and normal function of the testicles or ovaries in adults.; Damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus from surgery, injury, tumor, infection, or radiation; Genetic defects; High doses or long-term use of opioid or steroid (glucocorticoid) medicines; High prolactin level (a different hormone released by the pituitary); Severe stress; Nutritional problems (both rapid weight gain or weight loss); Long-term (chronic) medical diseases, including chronic inflammation or infections; Drug use, such as heroin or use or abuse of prescription opioid medicines; Certain medical conditions, such as iron overload"
000391,Lactic acidosis,,Symptoms may include:; Nausea; Vomiting; Weakness,"The most common cause of lactic acidosis is severe medical illness in which blood pressure is low and too little oxygen is reaching the body's tissues. Intense exercise or convulsions can cause temporary lactic acidosis. Certain diseases can also cause the condition, including:; Some medicines can rarely cause lactic acidosis:; AIDS; Alcoholism; Cancer; Cirrhosis; Cyanide poisoning; Kidney failure; Respiratory failure; Sepsis (severe infection); Beta adrenergic agonist inhalers used to treat asthma or COPD (albuterol and salmeterol); Epinephrine; Linezolid; Metformin, used to treat diabetes (most often when overdosed); Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used to treat HIV infection; Propofol"
000392,Familial hypercholesterolemia,Type II hyperlipoproteinemia; Hypercholesterolemic xanthomatosis; Low density lipoprotein receptor mutation,"In the early years there may be no symptoms.; Symptoms that may occur include:; Fatty skin deposits called xanthomas over parts of the hands, elbows, knees, ankles and around the cornea of the eye; Cholesterol deposits in the eyelids (xanthelasmas); Chest pain (angina) or other signs of coronary artery disease may be present at a young age; Cramping of one or both calves when walking; Sores on the toes that do not heal; Sudden stroke-like symptoms such as trouble speaking, drooping on one side of the face, weakness of an arm or leg, and loss of balance","Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder. It is caused by a gene variant on chromosome 19.; The defect makes the body unable to remove low density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol from the blood. This results in a high level of LDL in the blood. This makes you more likely to have narrowing of the arteries from atherosclerosis at an early age. The condition is typically passed down through families in an autosomal dominant manner. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order to inherit the disease.; In rare cases, a child may inherit the gene from both parents. When this occurs, the increase in cholesterol level is much more severe. The risk for heart attacks and heart disease are high, even in childhood."

Symptoms may include:; If your blood sugar level gets too low, you may faint, have a seizure, or even go into a coma.; Gastrinomas make the hormone gastrin, which tells the body to make stomach acid. Symptoms may include:; Glucagonomas make the hormone glucagon, which helps the body raise blood sugar level. Symptoms can include:; Somatostatinomas make the hormone somatostatin. Symptoms may include:; VIPomas make the hormone vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) which is involved in maintaining the balance of sodium, potassium and other minerals in the GI tract. VIPomas may cause:; Feeling tired or weak; Shaking or sweating; Headache; Hunger; Nervousness, anxiety, or feeling irritable; Unclear thinking or feeling uneasy; Double or blurry vision; Fast or pounding heartbeat; Abdominal pain; Diarrhea; Ulcers in the stomach and small bowel; Vomiting blood (occasionally); Diabetes; Red, blistery rash in the groin or buttocks; Weight loss; Frequent urination and thirst; High blood sugar; Gallstones; Yellowish appearance to skin, and eyes; Weight loss; Diarrhea with foul smelling stools; Severe diarrhea that may lead to dehydration; Low blood potassium levels, and high calcium levels; Abdominal cramps; Weight loss","In the healthy pancreas, cells called islet cells produce hormones that regulate several bodily functions. These include blood sugar level and the production of stomach acid.; Tumors that arise from islet cells of the pancreas can also produce a variety of hormones, which can lead to specific symptoms.; Pancreatic NETs can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).; NETs include:; A family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I (MEN I) is a risk factor for the development of NETs.; Gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome); Glucagonoma; Insulinoma; Somatostatinoma; VIPoma (Verner-Morrison syndrome)"
000394,Low blood sodium,Hyponatremia; Dilutional hyponatremia; Euvolemic hyponatremia; Hypervolemic hyponatremia; Hypovolemic hyponatremia,"Common symptoms include:; Confusion, irritability, restlessness; Convulsions; Fatigue; Headache; Loss of appetite; Muscle weakness, spasms, or cramps; Nausea, vomiting","Sodium is found mostly in the body fluids outside the cells. Sodium is an electrolyte (mineral). It is very important for maintaining blood pressure. Sodium is also needed for nerves, muscles, and other body tissues to work properly.; When the amount of sodium in fluids outside cells drops below normal, water moves into the cells. This causes the cells to swell with too much water. Brain cells are especially sensitive to swelling, and this causes many of the symptoms of low blood sodium.; With hyponatremia, the imbalance of water to sodium is caused by one of three conditions:; Low blood sodium can be caused by:; Euvolemic hyponatremia -- total body water increases, but the body's sodium content stays the same; Hypervolemic hyponatremia -- both sodium and water content in the body increase, but the water gain is greater; Hypovolemic hyponatremia -- water and sodium are both lost from the body, but the sodium loss is greater; Burns that affect a large area of the body; Diarrhea; Diuretic medicines (water pills), which increase urine output and loss of sodium through the urine; Heart failure; Kidney diseases; Cirrhosis (advanced liver disease); Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH); Sweating; Vomiting"

000396,Familial combined hyperlipidemia,Multiple lipoprotein-type hyperlipidemia,"In the early years, there may be no symptoms.; When symptoms appear, they may be due to impaired blood flow to parts of the body and include:; People with this condition may develop high cholesterol or triglyceride levels as teenagers. The condition may also be diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s. The levels remain high all during life. Those with familial combined hyperlipidemia have an increased risk of early coronary artery disease and heart attacks. They also have higher rates of obesity and are more likely to have glucose intolerance.; Chest pain (angina) or other signs of coronary artery disease may be present at a young age.; Cramping of one or both calves when walking.; Sores on the toes that do not heal.; Sudden stroke-like symptoms, such as trouble speaking, drooping on one side of the face, weakness of an arm or leg, and loss of balance.","Familial combined hyperlipidemia is the most common genetic disorder that increases blood fats. It can cause early heart attacks.; Diabetes, alcohol use, and hypothyroidism make the condition worse. Risk factors for being diagnosed with this condition include a family history of high cholesterol and early coronary artery disease."
000397,Familial hypertriglyceridemia,Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia,You may not notice any symptoms. Some people with the condition may have coronary artery disease at an early age.,"Familial hypertriglyceridemia is most likely caused by genetic variants combined with environmental factors. As a result, the condition clusters in families. How severe the disorder is can vary based on sex, age, hormone use, and dietary factors.; People with this condition also have high levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are often low.; In most cases, familial hypertriglyceridemia is not noticeable until puberty or early adulthood. Obesity, hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels), and high levels of insulin are often present as well. These factors may cause even higher triglyceride levels. Alcohol, a diet high in carbohydrates, and estrogen use can make the condition worse.; You are more likely to have this condition if you have a family history of hypertriglyceridemia or heart disease before age 50."
000398,Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I,Wermer syndrome; MEN I,"Symptoms vary from person to person, and depend on which gland is involved. They may include:; Abdominal pain; Anxiety; Black, tarry stools; Bloated feeling after meals; Burning, aching, or hunger discomfort in the upper abdomen or lower chest that is relieved by antacids, milk, or food; Decreased sexual interest; Fatigue; Headache; Lack of menstrual periods (in women); Loss of appetite; Loss of body or facial hair (in men); Mental changes or confusion; Muscle pain; Nausea and vomiting; Sensitivity to the cold; Unintentional weight loss; Vision problems; Weakness","MEN I is caused by a defect in a gene that carries the code for a protein called menin. The condition causes tumors of various glands to appear in the same person, but not necessarily at the same time.; The disorder may occur at any age, and it affects men and women equally. A family history of this disorder raises your risk."
000399,Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) II,Sipple syndrome; MEN II; Pheochromocytoma - MEN II; Thyroid cancer - pheochromocytoma; Parathyroid cancer - pheochromocytoma,"The symptoms may vary. However, they are similar to those of:; Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid; Pheochromocytoma; Parathyroid adenoma; Parathyroid hyperplasia","The cause of MEN II is a defect in a gene called RET. This defect causes many tumors to appear in the same person, but not necessarily at the same time.; Involvement of the adrenal gland is most often with a tumor called a pheochromocytoma.; Involvement of the thyroid gland is most often with a tumor called medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.; Tumors in the thyroid, adrenal, or parathyroid glands may occur years apart.; The disorder may occur at any age, and affects men and women equally. The main risk factor is a family history of MEN II.; There are two subtypes of MEN II. They are MEN IIa and IIb. MEN IIb is less common."

The variant results in the buildup of large lipoprotein particles that contain both cholesterol and a type of fat called triglycerides. The disease is linked to variants in the gene for apolipoprotein E.; Hypothyroidism, obesity, or diabetes can make the condition worse. Risk factors for familial dysbetalipoproteinemia include a family history of the disorder or coronary artery disease."
000403,High blood cholesterol levels,Cholesterol - high; Lipid disorders; Hyperlipoproteinemia; Hyperlipidemia; Dyslipidemia; Hypercholesterolemia,,"There are many types of cholesterol. The ones talked about most are:; For many people, abnormal cholesterol levels are partly due toÂ lifestyle choices. This often includes eating a diet that is high in fat. Other lifestyle factors are:; Some health conditions can also lead to abnormal cholesterol, including:; Medicines such as certain birth control pills, diuretics (water pills), beta-blockers, and some medicines used to treat depression may also raise cholesterol levels. Several disorders that are passed down through families lead to abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. They include:; Smoking does not cause higher cholesterol levels, but it can reduce your HDL (good) cholesterol.; Total cholesterol -- all the cholesterols combined; High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol -- often called ""good"" cholesterol; Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol -- often called ""bad"" cholesterol; Being overweight; Lack of exercise; Diabetes; Kidney disease; Polycystic ovary syndrome; Pregnancy and other conditions that increase levels of female hormones; Underactive thyroid gland; Familial combined hyperlipidemia; Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Familial hypertriglyceridemia"
000404,Malnutrition,Nutrition - inadequate,"Symptoms of malnutrition vary and depend on its cause. General symptoms include fatigue, dizziness, and weight loss.","There are many types of malnutrition, and they have different causes. Some causes include:; You may develop malnutrition if you lack a single vitamin in your diet. Lacking a vitamin or other nutrient is called a deficiency.; Sometimes malnutrition is very mild and causes no symptoms. Other times it can be so severe that the damage it does to the body is permanent, even though you survive.; Poverty, natural disasters, political problems, and war can all contribute to malnutrition and starvation, and not just in developing countries.; Some health conditions that are related to malnutrition are:; Malnutrition is a significant problem all over the world, especially among children. It is very harmful to children because it affects brain development and other growth.

These growths may appear on the back, buttocks, soles of the feet, or ankles, knees and elbows.","Chylomicronemia syndrome can occur due to a rare genetic disorder in which a protein (enzyme) called lipoprotein lipase (LpL) is broken or missing. It can also be caused by the absence of second factor called apolipoprotein C-II (also called apoCII), which activates LpL. LpL is normally found in fat and muscle. It helps break down certain lipids. When LpL is missing or broken, fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood. This buildup is called chylomicronemia.; Defects in apolipoprotein CII and apolipoprotein AV can cause the syndrome as well. It is more likely to occur when people who are predisposed to have high triglycerides (such as those who have familial combined hyperlipidemia or familial hypertriglyceridemia) develop diabetes, obesity or are exposed to certain medicines."

This hormone is made in the adrenal glands. Too much cortisol can be due to various problems. One of the causes is if there is too much of the hormone ACTH in the blood. ACTH is usually made by the pituitary in small amounts and then signals the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. Sometimes other cells outside the pituitary can make large amounts of ACTH. This is called ectopic Cushing syndrome. Ectopic means that something is occurring in an abnormal place in the body.; Ectopic Cushing syndrome is caused by tumors that release ACTH. Tumors that can, in rare cases, release ACTH include:; Benign carcinoid tumors of the lung; Islet cell tumors of the pancreas; Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid; Small cell tumors of the lung; Tumors of the thymus gland"

This hormone is made in the adrenal glands. Too much cortisol can be due to various problems. One such problem is a tumor on one of the adrenal glands. Adrenal tumors release cortisol.; Adrenal tumors are rare. They can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).; Noncancerous tumors that can cause Cushing syndrome include:; Cancerous tumors that may cause Cushing syndrome include an adrenal carcinoma. This is a rare tumor, but it usually makes excess cortisol.; Adrenal adenomas, a common tumor that rarely makes excess cortisol; Macronodular hyperplasia, which causes the adrenal glands to enlarge and make excess cortisol"

Without this enzyme, the body cannot break down fat from digested food. Fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood.; Risk factors include a family history of lipoprotein lipase deficiency.; The condition usually first develops during infancy or childhood."
000409,Leydig cell testicular tumor,Tumor - Leydig cell; Testicular tumor - Leydig,"There may be no symptoms.; When symptoms do occur, they can include:; Symptoms in other parts of the body, such as the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, back, or brain may also occur if the cancer has spread.; Discomfort or pain in the testicle; Enlargement of a testicle or change in the way it feels; Excess growth of breast tissue (gynecomastia) -- however, this can occur normally in adolescent boys who do not have testicular cancer; Heaviness in the scrotum; Lump or swelling in either testicle; Pain in the lower abdomen or back; Not able to father children (infertility)","The cause of this tumor is unknown. There are no known risk factors for this tumor. Unlike germ cell tumors of the testicles, this tumor does not seem to be linked to undescended testes.; Leydig cell tumors make up a very small number of all testicular tumors. They are most often found in men between 30 and 60 years of age. This tumor is not common in children before puberty, but it may cause early puberty."
000410,Cushing syndrome,Hypercortisolism; Cortisol excess; Glucocorticoid excess - Cushing syndrome; Cushing's syndrome,"Not everyone with Cushing syndrome has the same symptoms.

This form of Cushing syndrome is called exogenous Cushing syndrome. Prednisone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone are examples of this type of medicine. Glucocorticoids mimic the action of the body's natural hormone cortisol. These drugs are used to treat many conditions such as asthma, skin inflammation, cancer, bowel disease, joint pain, and rheumatoid arthritis.; Other people develop Cushing syndrome because their body produces too much cortisol. This hormone is made in the adrenal glands. Causes of too much cortisol are:; Cushing disease, which occurs when the pituitary gland makes too much of the hormone adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then signals the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol. A pituitary gland tumor can cause this condition.; Tumor of the adrenal gland; Tumor elsewhere in the body that produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH); Tumor elsewhere in the body that produces ACTH (ectopic Cushing syndrome)"
000411,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Adrenogenital syndrome; 21-hydroxylase deficiency; CAH,"Symptoms will vary, depending on the type of CAH someone has and their age when the disorder is diagnosed.; In children classic, salt-wasting CAH, several adrenal symptoms often develop within 2 or 3 weeks after birth. They may include:; Females with nonclassic CAH will usually have normal female reproductive organs (ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes). They may also have the following changes:; Males with nonclassic CAH often appear normal at birth. However, they may appear to enter puberty early. Symptoms may include:; Both males and females will grow rapidly during childhood, but be much shorter than normal as adults.; Females with classic CAH often have ambiguous genitalia at birth and may be diagnosed before symptoms appear.; Males have typical male genitalia at birth, even if they have a more severe form.; Poor feeding or vomiting; Diarrhea; Dehydration; Electrolyte changes (abnormal levels of sodium and potassium in the blood); Abnormal heart rhythm; Low blood glucose; Too much acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis); Weight loss; Shock; Abnormal menstrual periods or failure to menstruate; Early appearance of pubic or armpit hair; Severe acne; Excessive hair growth or facial hair; Some enlargement of the clitoris; Deepening voice; Severe acne; Early appearance of pubic or armpit hair; Enlarged penis but normal testes; Well-developed muscles","Your adrenal glands are 2 walnut-sized organs that sit one on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make the following hormones that are essential for life.; Most people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) lack an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase. The adrenal glands need this enzyme to make enough cortisol and aldosterone. Because of low cortisol levels, the body stimulates the adrenal gland, which then produces more androgen. This results in an imbalance of these hormones.; There are two main types of CAH that make up most of all cases: classic CAH and nonclassic CAH.; Classic CAH is rarer and more serious. It is often found at birth or early infancy. The body makes too little aldosterone and cortisol and too much androgen. There are two subtypes of classic CAH:; Nonclassic CAH is the mildest and most common form. The body produces enough aldosterone and cortisol, but too much androgen. It often is not diagnosed until later in childhood or adulthood. The person may not have any or only mild symptoms.; Cortisol regulates blood pressure, blood sugar, and energy levels. It also helps your body respond to illness and stress.; Aldosterone helps manage sodium and potassium levels in your blood to help regulate blood pressure.; Androgens are male sex hormones, such as testosterone. These hormones play a role in growth and development in both males and females.; Salt-wasting CAH. This is the most serious form, and it can cause life-threatening symptoms. The body makes too little aldosterone to regulate the sodium levels in the blood. This results in loss of sodium through the urine. It can be life-threatening without treatment.; Simple-virilizing CAH. This more moderate form of CAH does not cause life-threatening symptoms. The body makes enough aldosterone to regulate sodium levels, but it still produces too little cortisol and too much androgen."
000412,Raynaud phenomenon,Raynaud disease; Primary Raynaud; Secondary Raynaud,"Exposure to the cold or strong emotions bring on the changes.; People with Raynaud disease have problems in the same fingers on both sides. Most people do not have much pain. The skin of the arms or legs may develop bluish blotches which goes away when the skin is warmed up.; People with secondary Raynaud phenomenon are more likely to have pain or tingling in the fingers. Painful ulcers may form on the affected fingers if the attacks are severe.; First, the affected areas become white, and then turn blue. Fingers are most commonly involved, but toes, ears, lips or the nose can also change color as well.; When blood flow returns, the area becomes red and then later returns to normal color.; The attacks may last from minutes to hours.","When Raynaud phenomenon is a primary condition, meaning it occurs by itself and not in association with other diseases, it is referred to as Raynaud disease. It most often begins in women younger than age 30. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is when the condition is linked to other conditions and can occur at any age.; Common causes of secondary Raynaud phenomenon are:; Diseases of the arteries (such as atherosclerosis and Buerger disease); Drugs that cause narrowing of arteries (such as amphetamines, certain types of beta-blockers, some cancer drugs, certain drugs used for migraine headaches); Arthritis and autoimmune conditions (such as scleroderma, SjÃ¶gren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus); Certain blood disorders, such as cold agglutinin disease or cryoglobulinemia; Repeated injury or usage such as from heavy use of hand tools or vibrating machines; Smoking; Frostbite; Thoracic outlet syndrome"

The joints at the end of the fingers or toes may be more affected. Psoriatic arthritis most often causes arthritis only on one side of the body.; In some people, the disease may be severe and affect many joints, including the spine. Symptoms in the spine include stiffness and pain. They most often occur in the lower spine and sacrum.; Some people with psoriatic arthritis may have inflammation of the eyes.; Most of the time, people with psoriatic arthritis have the skin and nail changes of psoriasis. Often, the skin gets worse at the same time as the arthritis.; Tendons may become inflamed with psoriatic arthritis. Examples include the Achilles tendon, the plantar fascia, and the tendon sheath in the hand.","Psoriasis is a common skin problem that causes red patches on the skin. It is an ongoing (chronic) inflammatory condition. Psoriatic arthritis occurs in 7% to 42% of people with psoriasis. Nail psoriasis is linked to psoriatic arthritis.; In most cases, psoriasis comes before the arthritis. In a few people, the arthritis comes before the skin disease. However, having severe, wide-spread psoriasis appears to increase the chance of getting psoriatic arthritis.; The cause of psoriatic arthritis is not known. Genes, immune system, and environmental factors may play a role. It is likely that the skin and joint diseases have similar causes. However, they may not occur together."
000414,Paget disease of the bone,Osteitis deformans; Paget's disease of the bone,"Most people with the condition have no symptoms. Paget disease is often diagnosed when an x-ray is done for another reason.

It may be due to genetic factors, but also could be due to a viral infection early in life or hypersensitivity to vitamin D.; The disease occurs worldwide, but is more common in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The disease has become much less common over the last 50 years.; In people with Paget disease, there is an abnormal breakdown of bone tissue in specific areas. This is followed by abnormal bone formation. The new area of bone is larger, but weaker. The new bone is also filled with new blood vessels.; The affected bone may only be in one or two areas of the skeleton, or in many different bones in the body. It more often involves bones of the arms, collarbones, legs, pelvis, spine, and skull."
000415,Polymyalgia rheumatica,PMR,"The most common symptom is pain and stiffness in both shoulder regions and the neck. The pain and stiffness are worse in the morning. This pain most often progresses to the hip regions.; Fatigue is also present. People with this condition find it increasingly hard to get out of bed and to move around.; Other symptoms include:; Appetite loss, which leads to weight loss; Depression; Fever",Polymyalgia rheumatica most often occurs in people over 50 years old. The cause is unknown.; PMR may occur before or with giant cell arteritis (GCA; also called temporal arteritis). This is a condition in which blood vessels that supply blood to the head and eye become inflamed.; PMR can sometimes be hard to tell apart from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in an older person. This occurs when tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody are negative.

Fibrillin-1 plays an important role as the building block for connective tissue in the body.; The gene variant also causes the long bones of the body to grow too much. People with this syndrome have tall height and long arms and legs. How this overgrowth happens is not well understood.; Other areas of the body that are affected include:; In most cases, Marfan syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). However, up to 30% of people have no family history, which is called ""sporadic."" In sporadic cases, the syndrome is believed to be caused by a new gene change.; Lung tissue (there may be a pneumothorax, in which air can escape from the lung into the chest cavity and collapse the lung); The aorta, the main blood vessel that takes blood from the heart to the body may stretch or become weak (called aortic dilation or aortic aneurysm); The heart valves; The eyes, causing cataracts and other problems (such as a dislocation of the lenses); The skin; Tissue covering the spinal cord; The joints"

There may be no symptoms between attacks.; In some people CPPD arthritis causes severe damage to a joint.; CPPD arthritis can also occur in the upper and lower spine. Pressure on spinal nerves may cause pain in the arms or legs.; Because the symptoms are similar, CPPD arthritis can be confused with:; Pain; Swelling; Warmth; Redness; Gouty arthritis (gout); Osteoarthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis","Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) causes this form of arthritis. The buildup of this chemical forms crystals in the cartilage of joints. This leads to attacks of joint swelling and pain most often in the knees, wrists, ankles, and shoulders. Other joints can be affected as well. In contrast to gout, the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the big toe is not affected.; Among older adults, CPPD is a common cause of sudden (acute) arthritis in one joint. The attack may be caused by:; CPPD arthritis mainly affects the elderly because joint degeneration and osteoarthritis increases with age. Such joint damage increases the tendency of CPPD deposition.

000422,Gout,Gouty arthritis - acute; Gout - acute; Hyperuricemia; Tophaceous gout; Tophi; Podagra; Gout - chronic; Chronic gout; Acute gout; Acute gouty arthritis,"Symptoms of acute gout:; The pain and swelling most often go away after the first attack. Many people will have another attack in the next 6 to 12 months.; Some people may develop chronic gout. This is also called gouty arthritis. This condition can lead to joint damage and loss of motion in the joints. People with chronic gout will have joint pain and other symptoms most of the time.; Deposits of uric acid can form lumps below the skin around joints or other places such as the elbows, fingertips, and ears. The lump is called a tophus, from Latin, meaning a type of stone. Tophi (multiple lumps) can develop after a person has had gout for many years. These lumps may drain chalky material.; In most cases, only one or a few joints are affected. The big toe, knee, or ankle joints are most often affected. Sometimes many joints become swollen and painful.; The pain starts suddenly, often during the night. Pain is often severe, described as throbbing, crushing, or excruciating.; The joint appears warm and red. It is most often very tender and swollen (it hurts to put a sheet or blanket over it).; There may be a fever.; The attack may go away in a few days, but may return from time to time. Additional attacks often last longer.","Gout is caused by having higher-than-normal level of uric acid in your body. This may occur if:; When uric acid builds up in the fluid around the joints (synovial fluid), uric acid crystals form. These crystals cause the joint to become inflamed, causing pain, swelling and warmth.; The exact cause is unknown. Gout may run in families. The problem is more common in men, in women after menopause, and people who drink alcohol. As people become older, gout becomes more common.; The condition may also develop in people with:; Gout may occur after taking medicines that interfere with the removal of uric acid from the body.

The pain is often worse:; With OA, your joints may become stiffer and harder to move over time. You may notice a rubbing, grating, or crackling sound when you move the joint.; Morning stiffness refers to the pain and stiffness you feel when you first wake up in the morning. Stiffness due to OA often lasts for 30 minutes or less. It can last more than 30 minutes if there is inflammation in the joint. It often improves after activity, allowing the joint to warm up.; During the day, the pain may get worse when you are active and feel better when you are resting. As OA gets worse, you may have pain even when you are resting. And it may wake you up at night.; Some people might not have symptoms, even though x-rays show the physical changes of OA.; After exercise; When you put weight or pressure on the joint; When you use the joint","Cartilage is the firm, rubbery tissue that cushions your bones at the joints. It allows bones to glide over one another when the joint moves. When the cartilage breaks down and wears away, the fragments of the cartilage or the bones rub together. This often causes the pain, swelling, and stiffness of OA.; As OA worsens, bony spurs or extra bone may form around the joint. The ligaments and muscles around the joint may become weaker and stiffer.; Before age 55, OA occurs equally in men and women. After age 55, it is more common in women.; Other factors can also lead to OA.; Medical conditions that can lead to OA or symptoms similar to OA include:; OA tends to run in families.; Being overweight increases the risk for OA in the hip, knee, ankle, and foot joints. This is because extra weight causes more wear and tear.; Fractures or other joint injuries can lead to OA later in life. This includes injuries to the cartilage and ligaments in your joints.; Jobs that involve kneeling or squatting for more than an hour a day, or involve lifting, climbing stairs, or walking increase the risk for OA.; Playing sports that involve direct impact on the joint (football), twisting (basketball or soccer), or throwing also increase the risk for OA.; Bleeding disorders that cause bleeding in the joint, such as hemophilia; Disorders that block the blood supply near a joint and lead to bone death (avascular necrosis); Other types of arthritis, such as long-term (chronic) gout, pseudogout, or rheumatoid arthritis"

This tunnel is normally narrow. A thick ligament (tissue) just under your skin (the carpal ligament) makes up the top of this tunnel. Any swelling can pinch the nerve and cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. This is called carpal tunnel syndrome.; Some people who develop carpal tunnel syndrome were born with a small carpal tunnel.; Carpal tunnel syndrome can also be caused by making the same hand and wrist motion over and over. Using hand tools that vibrate may also lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.; Studies have not proved that carpal tunnel is caused by typing on a computer, using a mouse, or repeating movements while working, playing a musical instrument, or playing sports. But, these activities may cause tendinitis or bursitis in the hand, which can narrow the carpal tunnel and lead to symptoms.; Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs most often in people ages 30 to 60. It is more common in women than men.; Other factors that may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome include:; Alcohol use; Bone fractures and arthritis of the wrist; Cyst or tumor that grows in the wrist; Infections; Obesity; Extra fluids retained during pregnancy or menopause; Rheumatoid arthritis; Diseases that have abnormal deposits of protein in the body (amyloidosis)"

This is the most common type of psoriasis.; Pustular -- Yellow pus-filled blisters (pustules) are surrounded by red, irritated skin.","Psoriasis is common. Anyone can develop it, but it most often begins between ages 10 and 35, or as people get older.; Psoriasis isn't contagious. This means it doesn't spread to other people.; Psoriasis seems to be passed down through families.; Normal skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise to the surface about once a month. When you have psoriasis, on average this process takes place within 7 to14 days. This results in dead skin cells building up on the skin's surface, forming the collections of scales.; The following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make it harder to treat:; Psoriasis may be worse in people who have a weak immune system, including people with HIV/AIDS.; Some people with psoriasis also have arthritis (psoriatic arthritis).

This includes the disks or cushions between the neck vertebrae and the joints between the bones of the cervical spine. There may be abnormal growths or spurs on the bones of the spine (vertebrae).; Over time, these changes can press down on (compress) one or more of the nerve roots. In advanced cases, the spinal cord becomes involved. This can affect your arms, legs, and balance.; Everyday wear and tear may start these changes. People who are very active at work or in sports may be more likely to have them.; The major risk factor is aging. By age 60, most people show signs of cervical spondylosis on x-ray. Other factors that can make someone more likely to develop spondylosis are:; Being overweight and not exercising; Having a job that requires heavy lifting or a lot of bending and twisting; Past neck injury (often several years before); Past spine surgery; Ruptured or slipped disk; Severe arthritis; Previous surgery on the neck"

In adults, the feet, spine bones (vertebrae), and hips (pelvis) are most commonly affected.; Risk factors are:; Bacteria or other germs may spread to a bone from infected skin, muscles, or tendons next to the bone. This may occur under a skin sore.; The infection can start in another part of the body and spread to the bone through the blood.; The infection can also start after bone surgery. This is more likely if the surgery is done after an injury or if metal rods or plates are placed in the bone.; Diabetes; Hemodialysis; Poor blood supply; Recent injury; Use of injected illicit drugs; Surgery involving bones; Weakened immune system"
000438,Rotator cuff problems,Swimmer's shoulder; Pitcher's shoulder; Shoulder impingement syndrome; Tennis shoulder; Tendinitis - rotator cuff; Rotator cuff tendinitis; Shoulder overuse syndrome,"TENDINITIS; Early on, pain is mild and occurs with overhead activities and lifting your arm to the side. Activities include brushing your hair, reaching for objects on shelves, or playing an overhead sport.; Pain is more likely in the front of the shoulder and may travel to the side of the arm. The pain always stops before the elbow. If the pain goes down the arm to the elbow and hand, this may indicate a pinched nerve in the neck.; There may also be pain when you lower the shoulder from a raised position.; Over time, there may be pain at rest or at night, such as when lying on the affected shoulder. You may have weakness and loss of motion when raising the arm above your head. Your shoulder can feel stiff with lifting or movement. It may become more difficult to place the arm behind your back.; ROTATOR CUFF TEARS; The pain with a sudden tear after a fall or injury is usually intense. Right after the injury, you will likely have weakness of the shoulder and arm. It may be hard to move your shoulder or raise your arm above the shoulder. You may also feel snapping when trying to move the arm.; With a chronic tear, you often do not notice when it began. This is because symptoms of pain, weakness, and stiffness or loss of motion worsen slowly over time.; Rotator cuff tendon tears often cause pain at night. The pain may even wake you. During the day, the pain is more tolerable, and usually only hurts with certain movements, such as overhead or reaching toward the back.; Over time, the symptoms become much worse and are not relieved by medicines, rest, or exercise.","The shoulder joint is a ball and socket type joint. The top part of the arm bone (humerus) forms a joint with the shoulder blade (scapula). The rotator cuff holds the head of the humerus into the scapula. It also controls movement of the shoulder joint.; TENDINITIS; The tendons of the rotator cuff pass underneath a bony area on their way to attaching the top part of the arm bone. When these tendons become inflamed, they can become more inflamed over this area during shoulder movements. Sometimes, a bone spur narrows the space even more.; Rotator cuff tendinitis is also called impingement syndrome. Causes of this condition include:; TEARS; Rotator cuff tears may occur in two ways:; There are two types of rotator cuff tears:; Keeping the arm in the same position for long periods, such as doing computer work or hairstyling; Sleeping on the same arm each night; Playing sports requiring the arm to be moved overhead repeatedly such as in tennis, baseball (particularly pitching), swimming, and lifting weights overhead; Working with the arm overhead for many hours or days, such as in painting and carpentry; Poor posture over many years; Aging; Rotator cuff tears; A sudden acute tear may happen when you fall on your arm while it is stretched out. Or, it can occur after a sudden, jerking motion when you try to lift something heavy.; A chronic tear of the rotator cuff tendon occurs slowly over time. It is more likely when you have chronic tendinitis or impingement syndrome. At some point, the tendon wears down and tears.; A partial tear occurs when a tear does not completely sever the attachments to the bone.; A complete, full thickness tear means that the tear goes all the way through the tendon. It may be as small as a pinpoint, or the tear may involve the entire tendon. With complete tears, the tendon has come off (detached) from where it was attached to the bone. It can also be retracted and be pulled away from the bone. This kind of tear does not heal on its own."

However, it most often follows an infection, but the joint itself is not infected. Reactive arthritis most often occurs in men between the ages of 20 and 40, although it does sometimes affect women. It may follow an infection in the urethra after unprotected sex. The most common bacteria that cause such infections is called Chlamydia trachomatis. Reactive arthritis can also follow a gastrointestinal infection (such as food poisoning). In up to one half of people thought to have reactive arthritis, there may be no infection. It is possible that such cases are a form of spondyloarthritis.; Certain genes may make you more likely to get this condition.; The disorder is rare in young children, but it may occur in teenagers.

In other cases, you will notice that you have a hard time lifting your leg or arm, standing on your toes on one side, squeezing tightly with one of your hands, or other problems. Your bladder control may be lost.; The pain, numbness, or weakness often goes away or improves a lot over weeks to months.; With a herniated disk in your lower back, you may have sharp pain in one part of the leg, hip, or buttocks, and numbness in other parts. You may also feel pain or numbness on the back of the calf or sole of the foot. The same leg may also feel weak.; With a herniated disk in your neck, you may have pain when moving your neck, deep pain near or over the shoulder blade, or pain that moves to the upper arm, forearm, and fingers. You can also have numbness along your shoulder, elbow, forearm, and fingers.; After standing or sitting; At night; When sneezing, coughing, or laughing; When bending backward or walking more than a few yards or meters; When straining or holding your breath, such as when having a bowel movement","The bones (vertebrae) of the spinal column protect nerves that come out of the brain and travel down your back to form the spinal cord. Nerve roots are large nerves that branch out from the spinal cord and leave your spinal column between each vertebra.; The spinal bones are separated by disks. These disks cushion the spinal column and put space between your vertebrae. The disks allow movement between the vertebrae, which lets you bend and reach.; With herniated disk:; A herniated disk is a cause of radiculopathy. This is a condition that affects the spinal nerve roots.; Herniated disks occur more often in middle-aged and older men, usually after strenuous activity. Other risk factors may include:; The disk may move out of place (herniate) or break open (rupture) from injury or strain. When this happens, there may be pressure on one or more spinal nerves. This can lead to pain, numbness, or weakness.; The lower back (lumbar area) of the spine is the most common area affected by a herniated disk. The neck (cervical) disks are the second most commonly affected area. The upper-to-mid-back (thoracic) disks are rarely involved.; Lifting heavy objects; Being overweight; Repetitive bending or twisting the lower back; Sitting or standing in same position for long hours; Inactive lifestyle; Smoking"
000443,Compression fractures of the back,Vertebral compression fractures; Osteoporosis - compression fracture,"Compression fractures can occur suddenly.

These crystals can develop into stones over weeks or months.; Calcium stones can also form by combining with phosphate or carbonate.; Other types of stones include:; The biggest risk factor for kidney stones is not drinking enough fluids. Kidney stones are more likely to occur if you make less than 1 liter (32 ounces) of urine a day.; Calcium stones are most common. They are most likely to occur in men between ages 20 to 30. Calcium can combine with other substances to form the stone.; Oxalate is the most common of these substances. Oxalate is present in certain foods such as spinach. It is also found in vitamin C supplements. Diseases of the small intestine increase your risk for these stones.; Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria. This disorder runs in families. It affects both men and women.; Struvite stones are mostly found in men or women who have repeated urinary tract infections. These stones can grow very large and can block the kidney, ureter, or bladder.; Uric acid stones are more common in men than in women. They can occur with gout or after receiving chemotherapy for some types of cancer.; Other substances, such as certain medicines, also can form stones."
000459,Reflux nephropathy,Chronic atrophic pyelonephritis; Vesicoureteric reflux; Nephropathy - reflux; Ureteral reflux,"Some people have no symptoms of reflux nephropathy. The problem may be found when kidney tests are done for other reasons.; If symptoms do occur, they might be similar to those of:; Chronic kidney failure; Nephrotic syndrome; Urinary tract infection","Urine flows from each kidney through tubes called ureters and into the bladder. When the bladder is full, it squeezes and sends the urine out through the urethra. No urine should flow back into the ureter when the bladder is squeezing. Each ureter has a one-way valve where it enters the bladder that prevents urine from flowing back up the ureter.; But in some people, urine flows back up to the kidney. This is called vesicoureteral reflux.; Over time, the kidneys may be damaged or scarred by this reflux. This is called reflux nephropathy.; Reflux can occur in people whose ureters do not attach properly to the bladder or whose valves do not work well. Children may be born with this problem or may have other birth defects of the urinary system that cause reflux nephropathy.; Reflux nephropathy can occur with other conditions that lead to a blockage of urine flow, including:; Reflux nephropathy can also occur from swelling of the ureters after a kidney transplant or from injury to the ureter.; Risk factors for reflux nephropathy include:; Bladder outlet obstruction, such as an enlarged prostate in men; Bladder stones; Neurogenic bladder, which can occur in people with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diabetes, or other nervous system (neurological) conditions; Abnormalities of the urinary tract; Personal or family history of vesicoureteral reflux; Repeat urinary tract infections"

DI is a different disease than diabetes, though both share common symptoms of excessive urination and thirst.; Central diabetes insipidus is a form of DI that occurs when the body has a lower than normal amount of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. ADH is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland at the base of the brain.; ADH controls the amount of water excreted in urine. Without ADH, the kidneys do not work properly to keep enough water in the body. The result is a rapid loss of water from the body in the form of dilute urine. This results in the need to drink large amounts of water due to extreme thirst and to make up for excessive water loss in the urine (10 to 15 liters a day).; The reduced level of ADH may be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. This damage may be due to surgery, infection, inflammation, tumor, or injury to the brain.; In rare cases, central diabetes insipidus is caused by a genetic problem."

The swollen area prevents urine from moving freely into the bladder. The urine collects in the ureterocele and stretches its walls. It expands like a water balloon.; A ureterocele can also cause urine to flow backward from the bladder to the kidney. This is called reflux which may damage the kidney.; Ureteroceles occur in about 1 in 500 people. This condition is equally common in both the left and right ureters."
000463,Retroperitoneal fibrosis,Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis; Ormond's disease,"Early symptoms:; Later symptoms:; Dull pain in the abdomen or flank that increases with time; Pain and change of color in the legs (due to decreased blood flow); Swelling of one leg; Decreased urine output; No urine output (anuria); Nausea, vomiting, changes in mental status caused by kidney failure and build-up of toxic chemicals in the blood; Severe abdominal pain with blood in the stool (due to death of intestinal tissue)",Retroperitoneal fibrosis occurs when extra fibrous tissue forms in the area behind the stomach and intestines. The tissue forms a mass (or masses) or tough fibrotic tissue. It can block the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder.; The cause of this problem is mostly unknown. It is most common in people aged 40 to 60. Men are twice as likely to develop the condition as women.
000464,Interstitial nephritis,Tubulointerstitial nephritis; Nephritis - interstitial; Acute interstitial (allergic) nephritis,"Interstitial nephritis can cause mild to severe kidney problems, including acute kidney failure. In about half of cases, people will have decreased urine output and other signs of acute kidney failure.; Symptoms of this condition may include:; Blood in the urine; Fever; Increased or decreased urine output; Mental status changes (drowsiness, confusion, coma); Nausea, vomiting; Rash; Swelling of any area of body; Weight gain (from retaining fluid)","Interstitial nephritis may be temporary (acute), or it may be long-lasting (chronic) and get worse over time.; The acute form of interstitial nephritis is most often a side effect of certain drugs.; The following can cause interstitial nephritis:; Allergic reaction to a drug (acute interstitial allergic nephritis).; Autoimmune disorders, such as anti-tubular basement membrane disease or Kawasaki disease.; Infections.; Long-term use of medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

These gene problems are passed down through families (inherited) in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means the abnormal gene is needed from only one parent in order to inherit the disease. Often, many family members have the disease.; With all forms of ADTKD, as the disease progresses, the kidney tubules are damaged. These are the structures in the kidneys that allow most fluid in the blood to be filtered and returned to the blood.; The abnormal genes that cause the different forms of ADTKD are:; When the cause of ADTKD is not known or a genetic test has not been done, it is called ADTKD-NOS.; UMOD gene -- causes ADTKD-UMOD, or uromodulin kidney disease; MUC1 gene -- causes ADTKD-MUC1, or mucin-1 kidney disease; REN gene -- causes ADTKD-REN, or familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2 (FJHN2); HNF1B gene -- causes ADTKD-HNF1B, or maturity-onset diabetes mellitus of the young type 5 (MODY5)"

IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein is deposited in the kidneys. IgA builds up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney. Structures in the kidney called glomeruli become inflamed and damaged.; The disorder can appear suddenly (acute), or get worse slowly over many years (chronic glomerulonephritis).; Risk factors include:; IgA nephropathy can occur in people of all ages, but it most often affects males in their teens to late 30s.; A personal or family history of IgA nephropathy or Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura, a form of vasculitis that affects many parts of the body; White or Asian ethnicity"
000468,High blood pressure in adults â hypertension,Hypertension; HBP; High blood pressure,"Most of the time, there are no symptoms. For most people, high blood pressure is found when they visit their provider or have it checked elsewhere.; Because there are no symptoms, people can develop heart disease and kidney problems without knowing they have high blood pressure.; Malignant hypertension is a dangerous form of very high blood pressure. Symptoms may include:; Severe headache; Nausea and vomiting; Confusion; Vision changes; Nosebleeds","Many factors can affect blood pressure, including:; You are more likely to be told your blood pressure is too high as you get older. This is because your blood vessels become stiffer as you age. When that happens, your blood pressure goes up. High blood pressure increases your chance of having a stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney disease, or early death.; You have a higher risk for high blood pressure if you:; Most of the time, no cause of high blood pressure is found. This is called essential hypertension.; High blood pressure that is caused by another medical condition or medicine you are taking is called secondary hypertension. Secondary hypertension may be due to:; The amount of water and salt you have in your body; The condition of your kidneys, nervous system, or blood vessels; Your hormone levels; Are African American; Are obese; Are often stressed or anxious; Drink too much alcohol (more than 1 drink per day for women and more than 2 drinks per day for men); Eat too much salt; Have a family history of high blood pressure; Have diabetes; Smoke or use tobacco; Chronic kidney disease; Disorders of the adrenal gland (such as pheochromocytoma or Cushing syndrome); Hyperparathyroidism; Pregnancy or preeclampsia; Medicines such as birth control pills, diet pills, some cold medicines, migraine medicines, corticosteroids, some antipsychotics, and certain medicines used to treat cancer; Narrowed artery that supplies blood to the kidney (renal artery stenosis); Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)"
000471,Chronic kidney disease,Kidney failure - chronic; Renal failure - chronic; Chronic renal insufficiency; Chronic kidney failure; Chronic renal failure,"The early symptoms of CKD are the same as for many other illnesses.

You may not notice any symptoms for some time. The loss of function may be so slow that you do not have symptoms until your kidneys have almost stopped working.; The final stage of CKD is called end-stage renal disease (ESRD). At this stage, the kidneys are no longer able to remove enough wastes and excess fluids from the body. At this point, you would need dialysis or a kidney transplant.; Diabetes and high blood pressure are the 2 most common causes and account for most cases.; Many other diseases and conditions can damage the kidneys, including:; CKD leads to a buildup of fluid and waste products in the body. This condition affects most body systems and functions, including:; Autoimmune disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma); Birth defects of the kidneys (such as polycystic kidney disease); Some toxic chemicals; Injury to the kidney; Kidney stones and infection; Problems with the arteries feeding the kidneys; Some medicines, such as antibiotics, and pain and cancer medicines; Backward flow of urine into the kidneys (reflux nephropathy); High blood pressure; Low blood cell count; Vitamin D and bone health"

The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. The exact reason for this thickening is not known.; The thickened glomerular membrane does not work normally. As a result, large amounts of protein are lost in the urine.; This condition is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome. This is a group of symptoms and abnormal test results that include protein in the urine, low blood protein level, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, increased blood clot risk, and swelling. Membranous nephropathy may be a primary kidney disease, or it may be associated with other conditions.; The following increase your risk for this condition:; The disorder occurs at any age, but is more common after age 40.; Cancers, especially lung and colon cancer; Exposure to toxins, including gold and mercury; Infections, including hepatitis B, malaria, syphilis, and endocarditis; Medicines, including penicillamine, trimethadione, and skin-lightening creams; Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves disease, and other autoimmune disorders"

It is then filtered out of the body by the kidneys. Myoglobin breaks down into substances that can damage kidney cells.; Rhabdomyolysis may be caused by injury or any other condition that damages skeletal muscle.; Problems that may lead to this disease include:; Trauma or crush injuries; Use of drugs or medicines such as cocaine, amphetamines, statins, heroin, or PCP; Genetic muscle diseases; Extremes of body temperature; Ischemia or death of muscle tissue; Low phosphate levels; Seizures or muscle tremors; Severe exertion, such as marathon running or calisthenics; Lengthy surgical procedures; Severe dehydration"
000474,Bilateral hydronephrosis,Hydronephrosis - bilateral,"In a baby, signs of a problem are often found before birth during a pregnancy ultrasound.; A urinary tract infection in a newborn baby can signal a blockage in the kidney. An older child who gets repeat urinary tract infections should also be checked for blockage.; A higher than normal number of urinary tract infections is often the only symptom of the problem.; Common symptoms in adults may include:; Back pain; Nausea, vomiting; Fever; Need to urinate often; Decreased urine output; Blood in the urine; Urinary incontinence","Bilateral hydronephrosis occurs when urine is unable to drain from the kidney into the bladder. Hydronephrosis is not itself a disease. It occurs as a result of a problem that prevents urine from draining out of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.; Disorders linked with bilateral hydronephrosis include:; Acute bilateral obstructive uropathy -- sudden blockage of the kidneys; Bladder outlet obstruction -- blockage of the bladder, which does not allow drainage; Chronic bilateral obstructive uropathy -- a gradual blockage of both kidneys is most often from a common singular obstruction; Neurogenic bladder -- poorly functional bladder; Posterior urethral valves -- flaps on the urethra that causes poor emptying of the bladder (in boys); Prune belly syndrome -- poorly emptying bladder that causes distention of the belly; Retroperitoneal fibrosis -- abnormal scar tissue that blocks the ureters; Ureteropelvic junction obstruction -- blockage of the kidney at the point where the ureter enters the kidney; Vesicoureteric reflux -- backup of the urine from the bladder up to the ureter or kidney; Uterine prolapse -- when the bladder drops down and presses into the vaginal area. This causes a kink in the urethra, which prevents the urine from emptying out of the bladder."

The glomeruli of the kidney help filter wastes and fluids from the blood to form urine.; Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a form of glomerulonephritis caused by an abnormal immune response. Deposits of antibodies build up in a part of the kidneys called the glomerular basement membrane. This membrane helps filter wastes and extra fluids from the blood.; Damage to this membrane affects the kidney's ability to create urine normally. It may allow blood and protein to leak into the urine. If enough protein leaks into the urine, fluid may leak out of the blood vessels into body tissues, leading to swelling (edema). Nitrogen waste products may also build up in the blood (azotemia).; The 2 forms of this disease are MPGN I and MPGN II.; Most people with the disease have type I. MPGN II is much less common. It also tends to get worse faster than MPGN I.; Causes of MPGN may include:; Autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, SjÃ¶gren syndrome, sarcoidosis); Cancer (leukemia, lymphoma); Infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, endocarditis, malaria)"

It has a thin layer of muscle inside it. When your bladder fills up with urine, it sends a signal to your brain, telling the muscles to squeeze. Under normal conditions, these signals are not painful. If you have interstitial cystitis, the signals from the bladder are painful and may occur even when the bladder is not full.; The condition most often occurs between ages 20 to 40, although it has been reported in younger people.; Women are 10 times more likely to have IC than men.; The exact cause of this condition is unknown."
000480,Atheroembolic renal disease,Renal disease - atheroembolic; Cholesterol embolization syndrome; Atheroemboli - renal; Atherosclerotic disease - renal,,"AERD is linked to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a common disorder of the arteries. It occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries and form a hard substance called plaque.; In AERD, cholesterol crystals break off from the plaque lining the arteries. These crystals move into the bloodstream. Once in circulation, the crystals get stuck in tiny blood vessels called arterioles. There, they reduce blood flow to tissues and cause swelling (inflammation) and tissue damage that can harm the kidneys or other parts of the body. Acute arterial occlusion occurs when the large artery that supplies blood to the kidney suddenly becomes blocked.; The kidneys are involved about half of the time that plaque fragments block blood flow to blood vessels. Other body parts that may be involved include the skin, eyes, muscles and bones, brain and nerves, and organs in the abdomen. Acute kidney failure is possible if the blockages of the kidney blood vessels are severe.; Atherosclerosis of the aorta is the most common cause of AERD. The cholesterol crystals may also break off during aortic angiography, cardiac catheterization, or surgery of the aorta or other major arteries.; In some cases, AERD may occur without a known cause.; The risk factors for AERD are the same as risk factors for atherosclerosis, including age, male sex, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes."

This means there is a problem with the body's immune system.; Normally, the immune system helps protect the body from infection or harmful substances. But in people with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissues.; SLE may damage different parts of the kidney. This can lead to disorders such as:; Interstitial nephritis; Nephrotic syndrome; Membranous glomerulonephritis; Kidney failure"
000482,Analgesic nephropathy,Phenacetin nephritis; Nephropathy - analgesic; Nephropathy - NSAID,"There may be no symptoms in the beginning.

This is the part of the kidney that filters blood to make urine and remove waste. As a result, blood and protein appear in the urine, and excess fluid builds up in the body.; Swelling of the body occurs when the blood loses a protein called albumin. Albumin keeps fluid in the blood vessels. When it is lost, fluid collects in the body tissues.; Blood loss from the damaged kidney structures leads to blood in the urine.; Hemolytic uremic syndrome (disorder that occurs when an infection in the digestive system produces toxic substances that destroy red blood cells and cause kidney injury); Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura (disease that involves purple spots on the skin, joint pain, gastrointestinal problems and glomerulonephritis); IgA nephropathy (disorder in which antibodies called IgA build up in kidney tissue); Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (kidney disorder that occurs after infection with certain strains of streptococcus bacteria); Abdominal abscesses; Goodpasture syndrome (also called anti-glomerular basement membrane disease in which the immune system attacks the glomerular basement membrane); Hepatitis B or C; Endocarditis (inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and heart valves caused by a bacterial or fungal infection); Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (disorder that involves inflammation and changes to kidney cells); Rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis (a form of glomerulonephritis that leads to a rapid loss of kidney function); Lupus nephritis (kidney complication of systemic lupus erythematosus); Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels); Viral diseases such as mononucleosis, measles, and mumps"
000496,Minimal change disease,Minimal change nephrotic syndrome; Nil disease; Lipoid nephrosis; Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood,"There may be symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, including:; Minimal change disease does not reduce the amount of urine produced. It rarely progresses to kidney failure.; Foamy appearance of the urine; Poor appetite; Swelling (especially around the eyes, feet and ankles, and in the abdomen); Weight gain (from fluid retention)","Each kidney is made of more than a million units called nephrons, which filter blood and produce urine.; In minimal change disease, there is damage to the glomeruli. These are the tiny blood vessels inside the nephron where blood is filtered to make urine and waste is removed. The disease gets its name because this damage is not visible under a regular microscope. It can only be seen under a very powerful microscope called an electron microscope.; Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. It is also seen in adults with nephrotic syndrome, but is less common.; The cause is unknown, but the disease may occur after or be related to:; Allergic reactions; Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); Tumors; Vaccinations (flu and pneumococcal, though rare); Viral infections"

If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood will become too acidic. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells.; The kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine. Acidic substances in the body are neutralized by alkaline substances, mainly bicarbonate.; Proximal renal tubular acidosis (type II RTA) occurs when bicarbonate is not properly reabsorbed by the kidney's filtering system.; Type II RTA is less common than type I RTA. Type I is also called distal renal tubular acidosis. Type II most often occurs during infancy and may go away by itself.; Causes of type II RTA include:; Cystinosis (body is unable to break down the substance cysteine); Drugs such as ifosfamide (a chemotherapy drug), certain antibiotics that are no longer used much (tetracycline), or acetazolamide; Fanconi syndrome, a disorder of the kidney tubes in which certain substances normally absorbed into the bloodstream by the kidneys are released into the urine instead; Inherited fructose intolerance, a disorder in which there is a lack of the protein needed to break down the fruit sugar fructose; Multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer; Primary hyperparathyroidism, a disorder in which the parathyroid glands in the neck produce too much parathyroid hormone; SjÃ¶gren syndrome, an autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed; Wilson disease, an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues; Vitamin D deficiency"

ESRD occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to work at a level needed for day-to-day life.; The most common causes of ESRD in the United States are diabetes and high blood pressure. These conditions can damage your kidneys.; ESRD almost always comes after chronic kidney disease. The kidneys may slowly stop working during a period of 10 to 20 years before end-stage disease results.
000501,Acute kidney failure,Kidney failure; Renal failure; Renal failure - acute; ARF; Kidney injury - acute,"Symptoms of acute kidney failure may include any of the following:; Blood in the stools; Blood in the urine; Breath odor and metallic taste in the mouth; Bruising easily; Changes in mental status or mood; Decreased appetite; Decreased sensation, especially in the hands or feet; Fatigue or slow sluggish movements; Flank pain (between the ribs and hips); Hand tremor; Heart murmur; High blood pressure; Nausea or vomiting, may last for days; Nosebleeds; Persistent hiccups; Prolonged bleeding; Seizures; Shortness of breath; Swelling due to the body keeping in fluid (may be seen in the legs, ankles, and feet); Urination changes, such as little or no urine, excessive urination at night, or urination that stops completely","There are many possible causes of kidney damage.

It is caused by an infection with a type of streptococcus bacteria. The infection does not occur in the kidneys, but in a different part of the body, such as the skin or throat. The disorder may develop 1 to 2 weeks after an untreated throat infection, or 3 to 4 weeks after a skin infection.; It may occur in people of any age, but it most often occurs in children ages 6 through 10. Although skin and throat infections are common in children, poststreptococcal GN is rarely a complication of these infections. Poststreptococcal GN causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed. This makes the kidneys less able to filter the blood to create urine.; The condition is not common today because infections that can lead to the disorder are treated with antibiotics.; Risk factors include:; Strep throat; Streptococcal skin infections (such as impetigo)"
000504,Alport syndrome,Hereditary nephritis; Hematuria - nephropathy - deafness; Hemorrhagic familial nephritis; Hereditary deafness and nephropathy,"The main symptom of Alport syndrome is blood in the urine that is often not visible and only detected under a microscope. This occurs from a young age. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may appear.; KIDNEYS; Other symptoms of kidney problems include:; EARS; Over time, Alport syndrome also leads to hearing loss in both ears. By the early teens, it is common in males with XLAS, though in females, hearing loss is not as common and happens when they're adults. With ARAS, boys and girls have hearing loss during childhood. With ADAS, it occurs later in life.; Hearing loss usually occurs before kidney failure.; EYES; Alport syndrome also leads to eye problems in those with XLAS and ARAS, including:; Eye problems are uncommon in people with ADAS.; Abnormal urine color; Blood in the urine that is visible during a cold or flu or exercise; Flank pain; High blood pressure; Swelling throughout the body (edema); Fatigue; Poor appetite; Excessive thirst; Abnormal shape of the lens (anterior lenticonus), which can lead to a slow decline in vision as well as cataracts.; Corneal erosion in which there is damage to the outer layer of the covering of the eyeball, leading to pain, itching, redness of the eye, or blurred vision.; Abnormal coloring of the retina, a condition called dot-and-fleck retinopathy. It doesn't cause vision problems, but can help diagnose Alport syndrome.; Macular hole in which there is thinning or a break in the macula. The macula is a part of the retina that makes central vision sharper and more detailed. A macular hole causes blurred or distorted central vision.","Alport syndrome is an inherited form of kidney inflammation (nephritis). It is caused by a defect (mutation) in a gene for a protein in the connective tissue, called collagen.; The disorder is rare. There are three genetic types:; With all types of Alport syndrome, the kidneys are affected. The tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged. The glomeruli filter blood to make urine and remove waste products from the blood.; At first, there are no symptoms. Over time, as the glomeruli are more and more damaged, kidney function is lost and waste products and fluids build up in the body. The condition can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at an early age, between adolescence and age 40. At this point, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed.; X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) -- This is the most common type. The disease is more severe in males than in females.; Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS) -- Males and females have equally severe disease.; Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS) -- This is the rarest type. Males and females have equally severe disease."

These bacteria are common on the skin around the anus. They can also be present near the vagina.; Some factors make it easier for bacteria to enter or stay in the urinary tract, such as:; UTIs are more common in girls. This may occur as children begin toilet training around 3 years of age. Boys who are not circumcised have a slightly higher risk of UTIs before age 1.; Vesicoureteral reflux in which urine flow backs up from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys.; Brain or nervous system illnesses (such as myelomeningocele or spinal cord injury).; Bubble baths or tight-fitting clothes (girls).; Changes or birth defects in the structure of the urinary tract.; Not urinating often enough during the day.; Wiping from back (near the anus) to front after going to the bathroom. In girls, this can bring bacteria to the opening where the urine comes out."

Or, symptoms of the causes of prerenal azotemia may be present.; Symptoms of dehydration may be present and include any of the following:; Confusion; Decreased or no urine production; Dry mouth due to thirst; Fast pulse; Fatigue; Pale skin color; Swelling","Prerenal azotemia is common, especially in older adults and in people who are in the hospital.; The kidneys filter the blood. They also make urine to remove waste products. When the amount, or pressure, of blood flow through the kidney drops, filtering of the blood also drops. Or it may not occur at all. Waste products stay in the blood. Little or no urine is made, even though the kidney itself is working.; When nitrogen waste products, such as creatinine and urea, build up in the body, the condition is called azotemia. These waste products act as poisons when they build up. They damage tissues and reduce the ability of the organs to function.; Prerenal azotemia is the most common form of kidney failure in hospitalized people. Any condition that reduces blood flow to the kidney may cause it, including:; Conditions in which the heart cannot pump enough blood or pumps blood at a low volume also increase the risk for prerenal azotemia. These conditions include:; It can also be caused by conditions that interrupt blood flow to the kidney, such as:; Burns; Conditions that allow fluid to escape from the bloodstream; Long-term vomiting, diarrhea, or bleeding; Heat exposure; Decreased fluid intake (dehydration); Loss of blood volume; Certain medicines, such as ACE inhibitors (drugs that treat heart failure or high blood pressure) and NSAIDs; Heart failure; Shock (septic shock); Certain types of surgery; Injury to the kidney; Blockage of the artery that supplies blood to the kidney (renal artery occlusion)"

ADH normally causes the kidneys to make the urine more concentrated.; As a result of not responding to the ADH signal, the kidneys release too much water into the urine. This causes the body to produce a large quantity of very dilute urine.; NDI is very rare. Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus means it is present at birth. It is a result of a genetic variant passed down through families. Men are usually affected, though women can pass this gene on to their children.; Most commonly, NDI develops because of other reasons. This is called an acquired disorder. Factors that can trigger the acquired form of this condition include:; Blockage in the urinary tract; High blood calcium levels; Low blood potassium levels; Use of certain medicines (lithium, demeclocycline, amphotericin B)"

A hydrocele may occur on one or both sides. However, the right side is more commonly involved.","Hydroceles are common in newborn infants.; During a baby's development in the womb, the testicles descend from the abdomen through a tube into the scrotum. Hydroceles occur when this tube does not close after the testicle moves through it. Fluid drains from the abdomen through the open tube and gets trapped in the scrotum. This causes the scrotum to swell.; Most hydroceles go away a few months after birth. Sometimes, a hydrocele may occur with an inguinal hernia.; Hydroceles may also be caused by:; Buildup of the normal fluid around the testicle. This may occur because the body makes too much of the fluid or it does not drain well. (This type of hydrocele is more common in older men.); Swelling or injury of the testicle or epididymis."

The infection most commonly develops in the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys. Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria. However, certain conditions increase the risk for having UTIs.; Women tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. Because of this, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk for a UTI.; The following also increase your chances of developing a UTI:; Diabetes; Advanced age; Conditions that affect personal care habits (such as Alzheimer disease and delirium); Problems emptying the bladder completely; Having a urinary catheter; Bowel incontinence; Enlarged prostate, narrowed urethra, or anything that blocks the flow of urine; Kidney stones; Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, while you are recovering from a hip fracture); Pregnancy; Surgery or other procedure involving the urinary tract"

But, the bacteria can stick to the wall of the urethra or bladder, or grow so fast that some stay in the bladder.; Women tend to get infections more often than men. This happens because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus. Women are more likely to get an infection after sexual intercourse. Using a diaphragm for birth control can also be a cause. MenopauseÂ also increases the risk for a urinary tract infection.; The following also increase your chances of having cystitis:; Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli (E coli). It isÂ a type of bacteria found in the intestines.; A tube called a urinary catheter inserted in your bladder; Blockage of the bladder or urethra; Diabetes; Enlarged prostate, narrowed urethra, or anything that blocks the flow of urine; Loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence); Older age (most often in people who live in nursing homes); Pregnancy; Problems fully emptying your bladder (urinary retention); Procedures that involve the urinary tract; Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, when you are recovering from a hip fracture)"
000527,Sickle cell disease,Anemia - sickle cell; Hemoglobin SS disease (Hb SS); Sickle cell anemia,"Symptoms usually do not occur until after the age of 4 months.; Almost all people with sickle cell disease have painful episodes called crises. These can last from hours to days. Crises can cause pain in the lower back, leg, joints, and chest.; Some people have one episode every few years. Others have many episodes each year. The crises can be severe enough to require a hospital stay.; When sickle cell disease becomes more severe, symptoms may include:; Younger children with sickle cell disease have attacks of abdominal pain.; The following symptoms may occur because small blood vessels become blocked by the abnormal cells:; Over time, the spleen stops working. As a result, people with sickle cell disease may have symptoms of infections such as:; Other signs and symptoms include:; Fatigue; Paleness; Rapid heart rate; Shortness of breath; Yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice); Painful and prolonged erection (priapism); Poor eyesight or blindness; Problems with thinking or confusion caused by small strokes; Ulcers on the lower legs (in adolescents and adults); Bone infection (osteomyelitis); Gallbladder infection (cholecystitis); Lung infection (pneumonia); Urinary tract infection; Delayed growth and puberty; Painful joints caused by arthritis; Heart or liver failure due to too much iron (from blood transfusions)","Sickle cell disease is caused by an abnormal type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin is a protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen.; Sickle cell disease is inherited from both parents. If you get the sickle cell gene from only one parent, you will have sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait do not have the symptoms of sickle cell disease.; Sickle cell disease is much more common in people of African and Mediterranean descent. It is also seen in people from South and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East.; Hemoglobin S changes the red blood cells. The red blood cells become fragile and shaped like crescents or sickles.; The abnormal cells deliver less oxygen to the body's tissues.; They can also easily get stuck in small blood vessels and break into pieces. This can interrupt healthy blood flow and cut down even more on the amount of oxygen flowing to body tissues."
000528,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,G6PD deficiency; Hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency; Anemia - hemolytic due to G6PD deficiency,People with this condition do not display any signs of the disease until their red blood cells are exposed to certain chemicals in food or medicine.; Symptoms are more common in men and may include:; Dark urine; Fever; Pain in abdomen; Enlarged spleen and liver; Fatigue; Pallor; Rapid heart rate; Shortness of breath; Yellow skin color (jaundice),"G6PD deficiency occurs when a person is missing or does not have enough of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme helps red blood cells work properly.; Too little G6PD leads to the destruction of red blood cells. This process is called hemolysis. When this process is actively occurring, it is called a hemolytic episode. The episodes are most often brief. This is because the body continues to produce new red blood cells, which have normal G6PD activity.; Red blood cell destruction can be triggered by infections, certain foods (such as fava beans), and certain medicines, including:; Other chemicals, such as those in mothballs, can also trigger an episode.; In the United States, G6PD deficiency is more common among blacks than whites. Men are more likely to have this disorder than women.; You are more likely to develop this condition if you:; A form of this disorder is common in whites of Mediterranean descent. This form is also associated with acute episodes of hemolysis. Episodes are longer and more severe than in the other types of the disorder.; Antimalarial medicines such as quinine; Aspirin (high doses); Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); Quinidine; Sulfa medicines; Antibiotics such as quinolones, nitrofurantoin; Are African American; Are of Middle Eastern decent, particularly Kurdish or Sephardic Jewish; Are male; Have a family history of the deficiency"
000530,Hereditary spherocytic anemia,Congenital spherocytic hemolytic anemia; Spherocytosis; Hemolytic anemia - spherocytic,Infants may have yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and pale coloring (pallor).; Other symptoms may include:; Fatigue; Irritability; Shortness of breath; Weakness,"This disorder is caused by a genetic variation. The variant gene results in an abnormal red blood cell membrane. The affected cells have a smaller surface area for their volume than normal red blood cells, and can break open easily.; The anemia can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases the disorder may be found in early childhood. In mild cases it may go unnoticed until adulthood.; This disorder is most common in people of northern European descent, but it has been found in all races."
000531,Myelofibrosis,Idiopathic myelofibrosis; Myeloid metaplasia; Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia; Primary myelofibrosis; Secondary myelofibrosis; Bone marrow - myelofibrosis,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Abdominal fullness, pain, or feeling full before finishing a meal (because ofÂ an enlarged spleen); Bone pain; Easy bleeding, bruising; Fatigue; Increased likelihood of getting an infection; Pale skin; Shortness of breath with exercise; Weight loss; Night sweats; Low grade fever; Enlarged liver; Dry cough; Itchy skin","Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that develop into all of your blood cells. Your blood is made of:; When the bone marrow is scarred, it cannot make enough blood cells. Anemia, bleeding problems, and a higher risk for infections may occur.; As a result, the liver and spleen try to make some of these blood cells. This causes these organs to swell.; The cause of myelofibrosis is often unknown. There are no known risk factors. When it occurs, it often develops slowly in people over age 50. Women and men are equally affected. There is an increased occurrence of this condition in Ashkenazi Jews.; Blood and bone marrow cancers, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, and lymphoma, may also cause bone marrow scarring. This is called secondary myelofibrosis.; Red blood cells (which carry oxygen to your tissues); White blood cells (which fight infection); Platelets (which help your blood clot)"
000532,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),CLL; Leukemia - chronic lymphocytic (CLL); Blood cancer - chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Bone marrow cancer - chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Lymphoma - chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"Symptoms usually develop slowly. CLL often does not cause symptoms at first. It may be found by blood tests done in people for other reasons.; Symptoms of CLL may include:; Enlarged lymph nodes, liver, or spleen; Excessive sweating, night sweats; Fatigue; Fever; Infections that keep coming back (recur), despite treatment; Loss of appetite or becoming full too quickly (early satiety); Weight loss","The cause of CLL is unknown. There is no link to radiation exposure. It is unclear if certain chemicals can cause CLL. Exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War has been linked to a slight increased risk for developing CLL.; CLL usually affects older adults, especially those over age 60. People under age 45 rarely develop CLL. CLL is more common in white people than in people of other races. It is more common in men than in women. Some people with CLL have family members with the disease."
000533,Primary amyloidosis,Amyloidosis - primary; Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis; Primary systemic amyloidosis; Primary localized amyloidosis,"Symptoms depend on the organs affected. This disease can affect many organs and tissues, including the tongue, intestines, skeletal and smooth muscles, nerves, skin, ligaments, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and bladder.; Symptoms may include any of the following:; Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:; Abnormal heart rhythm; Fatigue; Numbness of hands or feet; Shortness of breath; Skin changes; Swallowing problems; Swelling in the arms and legs; Swollen tongue; Weak hand grip; Weight loss or weight gain; Decreased urine output; Diarrhea; Hoarseness or changing voice; Joint pain; Weakness","The cause of primary amyloidosis is not well understood. Genes may play a role.; The condition is related to abnormal and excess production of specific proteins. The proteins build up in certain organs. This makes it harder for the organs to work correctly.; Primary amyloidosis can lead to conditions that include:; Carpal tunnel syndromeÂ (due to protein deposits in the nerve); Heart muscle damage (cardiomyopathy) leading to congestive heart failure; Intestinal malabsorption; Liver swelling and malfunction; Kidney failure; Nephrotic syndrome (group of symptoms that includes protein in the urine, low protein levels in the blood, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, and swelling throughout the body); Nerve problems (neuropathy); Orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure when you stand up)"
000534,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH),PNH,"Symptoms may include:; Abdominal pain; Back pain; Blood clots, may form in some people; Dark urine, comes and goes; Easy bruising or bleeding; Headache; Shortness of breath; Weakness, fatigue; Pallor; Chest pain; Difficulty swallowing","People with this disease have blood cells that are missing a gene called PIG-A. This gene allows a substance called glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) to help certain proteins stick to cells.; Without PIG-A, important proteins cannot connect to the cell surface and protect the cell from substances in the blood called complement. As a result, red blood cells break down too early. The red cells leak hemoglobin into the blood, which can pass into the urine. This can happen at any time, but is more likely to occur during the night or early morning.; The disease can affect people of any age. It may be associated with aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myelogenous leukemia.; Risk factors, except for prior aplastic anemia, are not known."
000535,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),ITP; Immune thrombocytopenia; Bleeding disorder - idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; Bleeding disorder - ITP; Autoimmune - ITP; Low platelet count - ITP,"ITP symptoms can include any of the following:; Abnormally heavy periods in women; Bleeding into the skin, often around the shins, causing a skin rash that looks like pinpoint red spots (petechial rash); Easy bruising; Nosebleed or bleeding in the mouth","ITP occurs when certain immune system cells produce antibodies against platelets. Platelets help your blood clot by clumping together to plug small holes in damaged blood vessels.; The antibodies attach to the platelets. The body destroys the platelets that carry the antibodies.; In children, the disease sometimes follows a viral infection. In adults, it is more often a long-term (chronic) disease and can occur after a viral infection, with use of certain medicines, during pregnancy, or as part of an immune disorder.; ITP affects women more often than men. It is more common in children than adults. In children, the disease affects boys and girls equally."
000536,Polycythemia - newborn,Neonatal polycythemia; Hyperviscosity - newborn,Symptoms may include:; Extreme sleepiness; Feeding problems; Seizures,"The percentage of RBCs in the infant's blood is called the ""hematocrit."" When this is greater than 65%, polycythemia is present.; Polycythemia can result from conditions that develop before birth. These may include:; The extra RBCs can slow or block the flow of blood in the smallest blood vessels. This is called hyperviscosity. This may lead to tissue death from lack of oxygen. This blocked blood flow can affect all organs, including the kidneys, lungs, and brain.; Delay in clamping the umbilical cord; Diabetes in the baby's birth mother; Inherited diseases and genetic problems; Too little oxygen reaching body tissues (hypoxia), such as from congenital heart or vascular abnormalities; Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (occurs when blood moves from one twin to the other)"
000537,Hemophilia,Hemophilia A; Classic hemophilia; Factor VIII deficiency; Hemophilia B; Christmas disease; Factor IX deficiency; Bleeding disorder - hemophilia,"The main symptom of hemophilia is bleeding. Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mild cases may not be detected until later in life, after excessive bleeding following surgery or an injury. Precautions may need to be taken before engaging in sports.; In the worst cases, bleeding occurs for no reason. Internal bleeding may occur anywhere and bleeding into joints is common.","When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or aren't functioning like they should.; Hemophilia is caused by the lack of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. In most cases, hemophilia is passed down through families (inherited). Most of the time, it is passed to male children."
000538,Hemophilia A,Factor VIII deficiency; Classic hemophilia; Bleeding disorder - hemophilia A,"The severity of symptoms vary. Prolonged bleeding is the main symptom. It is often first seen when an infant is circumcised. Other bleeding problems usually show up when the infant starts crawling and walking.; Mild cases may go unnoticed until later in life. Symptoms may first occur after surgery or injury. Internal bleeding may occur anywhere.; Symptoms may include:; Bleeding into joints with associated pain and swelling; Blood in the urine or stool; Bruising; Gastrointestinal tract and urinary tract bleeding; Nosebleeds; Prolonged bleeding from cuts, tooth extraction, and surgery; Bleeding that starts without cause","When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves as many as 20 different special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should.; Factor VIII (eight) is one such coagulation factor. Hemophilia A is the result of the body not making enough factor VIII.; Hemophilia A is caused by an inherited X-linked recessive trait, with the variant gene located on the X chromosome. Females have two copies of the X chromosome. So if the factor VIII gene on one chromosome does not work, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor VIII.; Males have only one X chromosome. If the factor VIII gene is missing on a boy's X chromosome, he will have hemophilia A. For this reason, most people with hemophilia A are male.; If a woman has a variant factor VIII gene, she is considered a carrier. This means the variant gene can be passed down to her children. Boys born to such women have a 50% chance of having hemophilia A. Their daughters have a 50% chance of being a carrier. All female children of men with hemophilia carry the variant gene whereas male children do not.; Risk factors for hemophilia A include:; Family history of bleeding; Being male"

You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should.; Factor IX (nine) is one such coagulation factor. Hemophilia B is the result of the body not making enough factor IX. Hemophilia B is caused by an inherited X-linked recessive trait, with the variant gene located on the X chromosome.; Females have two copies of the X chromosome. If the factor IX gene on one chromosome does not work, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor IX.; Males have only one X chromosome. If the factor IX gene is missing on a boy's X chromosome, he will have Hemophilia B. For this reason, most people with hemophilia B are male.; If a woman has a variant factor IX gene, she is considered a carrier. This means the variant gene can be passed down to her children. Boys born to such women have a 50% chance of having hemophilia B. Their daughters have a 50% chance of being a carrier.; All female children of men with hemophilia carry the variant gene whereas male children do not.; Risk factors for hemophilia B include:; Family history of bleeding; Being male"

It is not yet known why they become solid or gel-like at low temperatures in the laboratory. In the body, these antibodies can form immune complexes that can cause inflammation and block blood vessels. This is called cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. This may lead to problems ranging from skin rashes to kidney failure.; Cryoglobulinemia is part of a group of diseases that cause damage and inflammation of the blood vessels throughout the body (vasculitis). There are three main types of this condition. They are grouped based on the type of antibody that is produced:; Type I cryoglobulinemia is most often related to cancer of the blood or immune systems.; Types II and III are also referred to as mixed cryoglobulinemia.; Types II and III are most often found in people who have a long-lasting (chronic) inflammatory condition, such as an autoimmune disease or hepatitis C. Most people with the type II form of cryoglobulinemia have a chronic hepatitis C infection.; Other conditions that may be related to cryoglobulinemia include:; Type I; Type II; Type III; Leukemia; Multiple myeloma; Primary macroglobulinemia; Rheumatoid arthritis; Systemic lupus erythematosus"

Symptoms of AML may include any of the following:; Bleeding from the nose; Bleeding and swelling (rare) in the gums; Bruising; Bone pain or tenderness; Fever and fatigue; Heavy menstrual periods; Pale skin; Shortness of breath (gets worse with exercise); Weight loss,"AML is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults.; AML is more common in men than women.; The bone marrow helps the body fight infections and makes other blood components. People with AML have many abnormal immature white blood cells inside their bone marrow. The cells grow very quickly, and replace healthy blood cells. As a result, people with AML are more likely to have infections. They also have an increased risk of bleeding as the numbers of healthy blood cells decrease.; Most of the time, a health care provider cannot tell you what caused AML. However, the following things can lead to some types of leukemia, including AML:; Problems with your genes may also cause AML to develop.; Blood disorders, including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelodysplasia; Certain chemicals (for example, benzene); Certain chemotherapy drugs, including etoposide and drugs known as alkylating agents; Exposure to certain chemicals and harmful substances; Radiation; Weak immune system due to an organ transplant"

000551,Folate-deficiency anemia,,Symptoms may include:; Fatigue; Weakness; Headache; Pallor; Sore mouth and tongue,"Folate (folic acid) is needed for red blood cells to form and grow. You can get folate by eating green leafy vegetables and liver. However, your body does not store folate in large amounts. So, you need to eat plenty of folate-rich foods to maintain normal levels of this vitamin.; In folate-deficiency anemia, the red blood cells are abnormally large. Such cells are called macrocytes. They are also called megaloblasts, when they are seen in the bone marrow. That is why this anemia is also called a type of megaloblastic anemia.; Causes of this type of anemia include:; The following raise your risk for this type of anemia:; Folic acid is needed to help a baby in the womb grow properly. Too little folic acid during pregnancy may lead to birth defects in a baby.; Too little folic acid in your diet; Hemolytic anemia; Long-term alcoholism; Use of certain medicines (such as phenytoin [Dilantin], methotrexate, sulfasalazine, triamterene, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and barbiturates); Alcoholism; Eating overcooked food; Poor diet (often seen in the poor, the older people, and people who do not eat fresh fruits or vegetables); Pregnancy; Weight loss diets"

This enzyme is called ADAMTS13. Absence of this enzyme results in platelet clumping. Platelets are particles in the blood that aid in blood clotting.; As the platelets clump together, fewer platelets are available in the blood in other parts of the body to help with clotting. This can lead to bleeding under the skin.; In some cases, the disorder is passed down through families (inherited). In these cases, people are born with naturally low levels of this enzyme.; This condition also may be caused by:; Cancer; Chemotherapy; Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; HIV infection; Hormone replacement therapy and estrogens; Medicines (including ticlopidine, clopidogrel, quinine, and cyclosporine A)"

This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should.; Factor X is one such coagulation factor. Factor X deficiency is often caused by an inherited defect in the factor X gene. This is called inherited factor X deficiency. Bleeding ranges from mild to severe depending on how severe the deficiency is.; Factor X deficiency can also be due to another condition or use of certain medicines. This is called acquired factor X deficiency. Acquired factor X deficiency is common. It can be caused by:; Women with factor X deficiency may first be diagnosed when they have very heavy menstrual bleeding and bleeding after childbirth. The condition may be first noticed in newborn boys if they have bleeding that lasts longer than normal after circumcision.; Lack of vitamin K (some newborns are born with vitamin K deficiency); Buildup of abnormal proteins in the tissues and organs (amyloidosis); Severe liver disease; Use of medicines that prevent clotting (anticoagulants such as warfarin)"

Symptoms may be severe from the start or gradually worsen over time as the disease progresses.; Low red cell count (anemia) can cause:; Low white cell count (leukopenia) causes an increased risk for infection.; Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) can result in bleeding. Symptoms include:; Fatigue; Pallor (paleness); Rapid heart rate; Shortness of breath with exercise; Weakness; Lightheadedness upon standing; Bleeding gums; Easy bruising; Nose bleeds; Rash, small pinpoint red marks on the skin (petechiae); Frequent or severe infections (less common)","Aplastic anemia results from damage to the blood stem cells. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that give rise to all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). Injury to the stem cells leads to a decrease in the number of these blood cell types.; Aplastic anemia can be caused by:; Sometimes, the cause is unknown. In this case, the disorder is called idiopathic aplastic anemia.; Use of certain medicines or exposure to toxic chemicals (such as chloramphenicol, benzene); Exposure to radiation or chemotherapy; Autoimmune disorders; Pregnancy; Viruses"
000556,Drug-induced thrombocytopenia,Drug-induced thrombocytopenia; Immune thrombocytopenia - drug,Decreased platelets may cause:; Abnormal bleeding; Bleeding when you brush your teeth; Easy bruising; Pinpoint red spots on the skin (petechiae),"Drug-induced thrombocytopenia occurs when certain medicines destroy platelets or interfere with the body's ability to make enough of them.; There are two types of drug-induced thrombocytopenia: immune and nonimmune.; If a medicine causes your immune system to produce antibodiesÂ which seek and destroy your platelets, the condition is called drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. Heparin, a blood thinner, is the most common cause of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia.; If a medicine prevents your bone marrow from making enough platelets, the condition is called drug-induced nonimmune thrombocytopenia. Chemotherapy drugs and a seizure medicine called valproic acid may lead to this problem.; Other medicines that cause drug-induced thrombocytopenia include:; Furosemide; Gold, used to treat arthritis; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); Penicillin; Quinidine; Quinine; Ranitidine; Sulfonamides; Linezolid and other antibiotics; Statins"
000557,Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH),PCH,"Symptoms may include:; Chills; Fever; Back pain; Leg pain; Abdominal pain; Headache; General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise); Blood in the urine (red urine)","PCH only occurs in the cold, and affects mainly the hands and feet. Antibodies attach (bind) to red blood cells. This allows other proteins in the blood (called complement) to also latch on. The antibodies destroy the red blood cells as they move through the body. As the cells are destroyed, hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen, is released into the blood and passed in the urine.; PCH has been linked to secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and other viral or bacterial infections. Sometimes the cause is unknown.; The disorder is rare."
000558,Congenital antithrombin III deficiency,Deficiency - antithrombin III - congenital; Antithrombin III deficiency - congenital,"People will usually have symptoms of a blood clot. Blood clots in the arms or legs usually cause swelling, redness, and pain. When a blood clot breaks off from where it formed and travels to another part of the body, it is called a thromboembolism. Symptoms depend on where the blood clot travels to. A common place is the lung, where the clot can cause a cough, shortness of breath, pain while taking deep breaths, chest pain, and even death. Blood clots that travel to the brain can cause a stroke.",Antithrombin III is a protein in the blood that blocks abnormal blood clots from forming. It helps the body keep a healthy balance between bleeding and clotting. Congenital antithrombin III deficiency is an inherited disease. It occurs when a person receives one abnormal copy of the antithrombin III gene from a parent with the disease.; The abnormal gene leads to a low level of the antithrombin III protein. This low level of antithrombin III can cause abnormal blood clots (thrombi) that can block blood flow and damage organs.; People with this condition will often have blood clots at a young age. They are also likely to have family members who have had a blood clotting problem.
000559,Congenital protein C or S deficiency,Protein S deficiency; Protein C deficiency,"If you have this condition, you are more likely to develop blood clots, especially at a younger age. The symptoms are the same as for deep vein thrombosis, and include:; Pain or tenderness in the affected area; Redness or swelling in the affected area","Congenital protein C or S deficiency is an inherited disorder. This means it is passed down through families. Congenital means it is present at birth.; The disorder causes abnormal blood clotting.; One in 300 people has one normal gene and one faulty gene for protein C deficiency.; Protein S deficiency is much less common and occurs in about 1 in 20,000 people."

Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.; Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells.; Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin.; The body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients due to:; Possible causes of anemia include:; Changes in the lining of the stomach or intestines that affect how well nutrients are absorbed (for example, celiac disease); Poor diet; Surgery that removes part of the stomach or intestines; Iron deficiency; Vitamin B12 deficiency; Folate deficiency; Certain medicines; Destruction of red blood cells earlier than normal (which may be caused by immune system problems); Long-term (chronic) diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cancer, ulcerative colitis, or rheumatoid arthritis; Some forms of anemia, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, which can be inherited; Pregnancy; Problems with bone marrow such as lymphoma, leukemia, myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma, or aplastic anemia; Slow blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or stomach ulcers); Sudden heavy blood loss"

The first form is passed on by both parents due to genetic variants in both. The parents usually do not have the condition themselves. They carry the gene that causes the condition. It occurs when there is a problem with an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase.; There are two types of inherited MetHb:; The second form of inherited MetHb is called hemoglobin M disease. It is caused by defects in the hemoglobin protein itself. Only one parent needs to pass on the variant gene for the child to inherit the disease.; Acquired MetHb is more common than the inherited forms. It occurs in some people after they are exposed to certain chemicals and medicines, including:; Passed down through families (inherited or congenital); Caused by exposure to certain medicines, chemicals, or foods (acquired); Type 1 (also called erythrocyte reductase deficiency) occurs when RBCs lack the enzyme.; Type 2 (also called generalized reductase deficiency) occurs when the enzyme doesn't work in the body.; Anesthetics such as benzocaine; Nitrobenzene; Certain antibiotics (including dapsone and chloroquine); Nitrites (used as additives to prevent meat from spoiling)"

Other symptoms may include:; Bone pain and fractures; Cognitive impairment (decreased thinking ability); Easy bruising; Enlarged spleen; Enlarged liver; Fatigue; Heart valve problems; Lung disease (rare); Seizures; Severe swellingÂ at birth; Skin changes,"Gaucher disease is rare in the general population. People of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) Jewish heritage are more likely to have this disease.; It is an autosomal recessive disease. This means that the mother and father must both passÂ one abnormal copy of the disease gene to their child in order for the child to develop the disease. A parent who carries an abnormal copy of the gene but doesn't have the disease is called a silent carrier.; The lack of the GBA causes harmful substances to build up in the liver, spleen, bones, and bone marrow. These substances prevent cells and organs from working properly.; There are three main subtypes of Gaucher disease:; Type 1 is most common. It involves bone disease, anemia, an enlarged spleen and low platelets (thrombocytopenia). Type 1 affects both children and adults. It is most common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.; Type 2 usually begins in infancy with severe neurologic involvement. This form can lead to rapid, early death.; Type 3 may cause liver, spleen, and brain problems.Â People with this typeÂ may live into adulthood."

The body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. You get this vitamin from eating foods such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products.; A special protein, called intrinsic factor (IF), binds vitamin B12 so that it can be absorbed in the intestines. This protein is released by cells in the stomach. When the stomach does not make enough intrinsic factor, the intestine cannot properly absorb vitamin B12.; Common causes of pernicious anemia include:; In rare cases, pernicious anemia is passed down through families. This is called congenital pernicious anemia. Babies with this type of anemia do not make enough intrinsic factor. Or they cannot properly absorb vitamin B12 in the small intestine.; In adults, symptoms of pernicious anemia are usually not seen until after age 30. The average age of diagnosis is age 60.; You are more likely to develop this disease if you:; Certain diseases can also raise your risk. They include:; Pernicious anemia can also occur after gastric bypass surgery.; Weakened stomach lining (atrophic gastritis); An autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks the actual intrinsic factor protein or the cells in the lining of your stomach that make it.; Are Scandinavian or Northern European; Have a family history of the condition; Addison disease; Graves disease; Hypoparathyroidism; Hypothyroidism; Myasthenia gravis; Loss of normal function of ovaries before 40 years of age (primary ovarian failure); Type 1 diabetes; Testicular dysfunction; Vitiligo; SjÃ¶gren syndrome; Hashimoto disease; Celiac disease"

The disease may have few or no symptoms during this time. Most people are diagnosed during this stage, when they have blood tests done for other reasons.; The accelerated phase is a more dangerous phase. Leukemia cells grow more quickly. Common symptoms include fever (even without infection), bone pain, and a swollen spleen.; Untreated CML leads to the blast crisis phase. Bleeding and infection may occur due to bone marrow failure.; Other possible symptoms of a blast crisis include:; Chronic; Accelerated; Blast crisis; Bruising; Excessive sweating (night sweats); Fatigue; Fever; Pressure under the lower left ribs from a swollen spleen; Rash -- small pinpoint red marks on the skin (petechiae); Weakness",The cause of CML is related to an abnormal chromosome called the Philadelphia chromosome.; Radiation exposure can increase the risk of developing CML. Radiation exposure can be from radiation treatments used in the past to treat thyroid cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma or from a nuclear disaster.; It takes many years to develop leukemia from radiation exposure. Most people treated for cancer with radiation do not develop leukemia. And most people with CML have not been exposed to radiation.; CML most often occurs in middle-age adults and in children.

If these proteins become abnormally active throughout the body, you could develop DIC. The underlying cause is usually due to inflammation, infection, or cancer.; In some cases of DIC, small blood clots form in the blood vessels. Some of these clots can clog the vessels and cut off the normal blood supply to organs such as the liver, brain, or kidneys. Lack of blood flow can damage and cause major injury to the organs.; In other cases of DIC, the clotting proteins in your blood are consumed. When this happens, you may have a high risk of serious bleeding, even from a minor injury or without injury. You may also have bleeding that starts spontaneously (on its own).

000618,Erysipelas,Strep infection - erysipelas; Streptococcal infection - erysipelas; Cellulitis - erysipelas,"The infection occurs on the legs or arms most of the time. It may also occur on the face and trunk.; Symptoms of erysipelas may include:; Fever and chillsÂ; Skin sore with a sharp raised border. As the infection spreads, the skin is painful, very red, swollen, and warm. Blisters on the skin can form.",Erysipelas is usually caused by group A streptococcus bacteria. The condition may affect both children and adults.; Some conditions that can lead to erysipelas are:; A cut in the skin; Problems with drainage through the veins or lymph system; Skin sores (ulcers)
000619,Ear infection - chronic,Middle ear infection - chronic; Otitis media - chronic; Chronic otitis media; Chronic ear infection,"Symptoms of a chronic ear infection may be less severe than symptoms of an acute infection. The problem may go unnoticed and untreated for a long time.; Symptoms may include:; Symptoms may continue or come and go. They may occur in one or both ears.; Ear pain or discomfort that is usually mild and feels like pressure in the ear; Fever, usually low-grade; Fussiness in infants; Pus-like drainage from the ear; Hearing loss","The eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. When this happens, infection can occur. A chronic ear infection develops when fluid or an infection behind the eardrum does not go away.; A chronic ear infection may be caused by:; Suppurative chronic otitis is a term used to describe an eardrum that keeps rupturing, draining, or swelling in the middle ear or mastoid area (the bone behind the ear) and does not go away.; Ear infections are more common in children because their eustachian tubes are shorter, narrower, and more horizontal than in adults. Chronic ear infections are much less common than acute ear infections.; An acute ear infection that does not completely go away; Repeated ear infections"
000620,Gas gangrene,Tissue infection - clostridial; Gangrene - gas; Myonecrosis; Clostridial infection of tissues; Necrotizing soft tissue infection,"Gas gangrene causes very painful swelling. The skin turns pale to brownish-red. When the swollen area is pressed, gas can be felt (and sometimesÂ heard)Â as a crackly sensation (crepitus). The edges of the infected area grow so quickly that changes can be seen over minutes. The area may be completely destroyed.; Symptoms include:; If the condition is not treated, the person can go into shock with decreased blood pressure (hypotension), kidney failure, coma, and finally death.; Air under the skin (subcutaneous emphysema); Blisters filled with brown-red fluid; Drainage from the tissues, foul-smelling brown-red or bloody fluid (serosanguineous discharge); Increased heart rate (tachycardia); Moderate to high fever; Moderate to severe pain around a skin injury; Pale skin color, later becoming dusky and changing to dark red or purple; Swelling that worsens around a skin injury; Sweating; Vesicle formation, combining into large blisters; Yellow color to the skin (jaundice)","Gas gangrene is most often caused by bacteria called Clostridium perfringens. Also, it can occasionally be caused caused by group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio vulnificus.; Clostridium is found nearly everywhere. As the bacteria grow inside the body, they emit gas and harmful substances (toxins) that can damage body tissues, cells, and blood vessels.; Gas gangrene develops suddenly. It usually occurs at the site of trauma or a recent surgical wound. In some cases, it occurs without an irritating event. People most at risk for gas gangrene usually have blood vessel disease (atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries), diabetes, or colon cancer."
000621,Malaria,Quartan malaria; Falciparum malaria; Biduoterian fever; Blackwater fever; Tertian malaria; Plasmodium,"Symptoms include:; Anemia (condition in which the body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells); Bloody stools; Chills, fever, sweating; Coma; Convulsions; Headache; Jaundice; Muscle pain; Nausea and vomiting","Malaria is caused by a parasite. It is passed to humans by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. After infection, the parasites (called sporozoites) travel through the bloodstream to the liver. There, they mature and release another form of parasites, called merozoites. The parasites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells (RBCs).; The parasites multiply inside the red blood cells. The cells then break open within 48 to 72 hours and infect more red blood cells. The first symptoms usually occur 2 to 4 weeks after infection, though they can appear as early as 8 days or as long as a year after infection. The symptoms occur in cycles of 48 to 72 hours.; Most symptoms are caused by:; Malaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions. Malaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite disappears over the winter.; The disease is a major health problem in much of the tropics and subtropics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2020 there were about 241 million cases of malaria. About 627,000 people died of it. Malaria is a major disease hazard for travelers to warm climates.; In some areas of the world, mosquitoes that carry malaria have developed resistance to insecticides. In addition, the parasites have developed resistance to some antibiotics. These conditions have made it hard to control both the rate of infection and spread of this disease.; The release of merozoites into the bloodstream; Anemia resulting from the destruction of the red blood cells; Large amounts of free hemoglobin being released into circulation after red blood cells break open, which can damage other organs such as the kidneys"
000622,Swimmer's ear,Ear infection - outer ear - acute; Otitis externa - acute; Chronic swimmer's ear; Otitis externa - chronic; Ear infection - outer ear - chronic,"Symptoms of swimmer's ear include:; Drainage from the ear -- yellow, yellow-green, pus-like, or foul smelling; Ear pain, which may get worse when you pull on the outer ear; Hearing loss; Itching of the ear or ear canal","Swimmer's ear is more common among children in their teens and young adults. It may occur with a middle ear infection or a respiratory infection such as a cold.; Swimming in unclean water can lead to swimmer's ear. Bacteria commonly often found in water can cause ear infections. Rarely, the infection may be caused by a fungus.; Other causes of swimmer's ear include:; Trying to clean (wax from the ear canal) with cotton swabs or small objects can also damage the skin.; Long-term (chronic) swimmer's ear may be due to:; Scratching the ear or inside the earÂ which can damage the skin of the ear canal; Getting something stuck in the ear; Allergic reaction to something placed in the ear; Chronic skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis"
000624,Disseminated tuberculosis,Miliary tuberculosis; Tuberculosis - disseminated; Extrapulmonary tuberculosis,"DisseminatedÂ tuberculosis can affect many different body areas.

The resulting lung infection is called primary TB.; The usual site of TB is the lungs (pulmonary TB), but other organs can be involved. In the United States, most people with primary TB get better and have no further evidence of disease. Disseminated TB develops in a small number of infected people whose immune systems do not successfully contain the primary infection.; Disseminated disease can occur within weeks of the primary infection. Sometimes, it occurs years after you become infected. You are more likely to get this type of TB if you have a weakened immune system due to disease (such as AIDS) or certain medicines. Infants and older adults are also at higher risk.; Your risk of catching TB increases if you:; The following factors can increase the rate of TB infection in a population:; Are around people who have the disease (such as during overseas travel); Live in crowded or unclean conditions; Are immunocompromised by a disease or medicines; Have poor nutrition; Increase in HIV infections; Increase in number of homeless people with unstable housing (poor environment and nutrition); The appearance of drug-resistant strains of TB"

These include bacteria and fungi. While most germs are harmless, some can cause infection under certain conditions.; Thrush occurs in children and adults when conditions permit too much growth of a fungus called candida in your mouth. A small amount of this fungus normally lives in your mouth. It is most often kept in check by your immune system and other germs that also live in your mouth.; When your immune system is weak or when normal bacteria die, too much of the fungus can overgrow and cause thrush.; You are more likely to get thrush if you have one of the following:; Candida can also cause yeast infections in the vagina.; Thrush in newborns is somewhat common and easy to treat.; You are in poor health.; You are very old. Young babies are also more likely to develop thrush.; You have HIV or AIDS.; You are receiving chemotherapy or drugs that weaken the immune system.; You are taking steroid medicine, including some inhalers for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).; You have diabetes mellitus and your blood sugar is high.; You take antibiotics. Antibiotics kill some of the healthy bacteria that prevent candida from growing too much.; Your dentures do not fit well."
000627,Cysticercosis,,"Most often, the worms stay in muscles and do not cause symptoms.; Symptoms occur depending on where the infection is found in the body:; Brain -- seizures or symptoms similar to those of a brain tumor; Eyes -- decreased vision or blindness; Heart -- abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure (rare); Spine -- weakness or changes in walking due to damage to nerves in the spine","Cysticercosis is caused by swallowing eggs from T solium. The eggs are found in contaminated food. Autoinfection is when a person who is already infected with adult T solium swallows its eggs. This occurs due to improper hand washing after a bowel movement (fecal-oral transmission).; Risk factors include eating pork, fruits, and vegetables contaminated with T solium as a result of undercooking or improper food preparation. The disease can also be spread by contact with infected feces.; The disease is rare in the United States. It is common in many developing countries."
000628,Ascariasis,Intestinal parasite - ascariasis; Roundworm - ascariasis,"Most of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include:; Bloody sputumÂ (mucus coughed up by the lower airways); Cough, wheezing; Low-grade fever; Passing worms in stool; Shortness of breath; Skin rash; Stomach pain; Vomiting or coughing up worms; Worms leaving the body through the nose or mouth","People get ascariasis by consuming food or drink that is contaminated with roundworm eggs. Ascariasis is the most common intestinal worm infection. It is related to poor sanitation. People who live in places where human feces (stool) are used as fertilizer are also at risk for this disease.; Once consumed, the eggs hatch and release immature roundworms called larvae inside the small intestine. Within a few days, the larvae move through the bloodstream to the lungs. They travel up through the large airways of the lungs and are swallowed back into the stomach and small intestine.; As the larvae move through the lungs they may cause an uncommon form of pneumonia called eosinophilic pneumonia. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. Once the larvae are back in the small intestine, they mature into adult roundworms. Adult worms live in the small intestine, where they lay eggs that are present in feces. They can live 10 to 24 months.; An estimated 1 billion people are infected worldwide. Ascariasis occurs in people of all ages, though children are affected more severely than adults."

The last two types also occur in animals.; Hookworm disease is common in the moist tropics and subtropics. In developing nations, the disease leads to the death of many children by weakening their immune system and increasing their risk for infections that their bodies would normally fight off.; There is very little risk of getting the disease in the United States because of advances in sanitation and waste control. The important factor in getting the disease is walking barefoot on ground where there are feces of people who are infected with hookworm.; The larvae (immature form of the worm) enter the skin. The larvae move to the lungs via the bloodstream and enter the airways. The worms are about one-half inch (1 centimeter) long.; After traveling up the windpipe, the larvae are swallowed. After the larvae are swallowed, they infect the small intestine. They develop into adult worms and live there for 1 or more years. The worms attach to the intestinal wall and suck blood, which can result in iron deficiency anemia and protein loss. Adult worms and larvae are released in the feces.; Necator americanus; Ancylostoma duodenale; Ancylostoma ceylanicum; Ancylostoma braziliense"
000630,Strongyloidiasis,Intestinal parasite - strongyloidiasis; Roundworm - strongyloidiasis,"Most of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include:; Abdominal pain (upper abdomen); Cough; Diarrhea; Rash; Red hive-like areas near the anus; Vomiting; Weight loss; Fever","SÂ stercoralis is a roundworm that is fairly common in warm, moist areas. In rare cases, it can be found as far north as Canada.; People catch the infection when their skin comes in contact with soil that is contaminated with the worms.; The tiny worm is barely visible to the naked eye. Young roundworms can move through a person's skin and eventually into the bloodstream to the lungs and airways.; They then move up to the throat, where they are swallowed into the stomach. From the stomach, the worms move to the small intestine, where they attach to the intestinal wall. Later, they produce eggs, which hatch into tiny larvae (immature worms) and pass out of the body.; Unlike other worms, these larvae can re-enter the body through the skin around the anus, which allows an infection to grow. Areas where the worms go through the skin can become red and painful.; This infection is uncommon in the United States, but it does occur in the southeastern US. Most cases in North America are brought by travelers who have visited or lived in South America or Africa.; Some people are at risk for a severe type called strongyloidiasis hyperinfection syndrome. In this form of the condition, there are more worms and they multiply more quickly than normal. It can occur in people who have a weakened immune system. This includes people who have had an organ or blood-product transplant, people with HIV/AIDS, and those who take steroid medicine or immune-suppressing drugs."

This parasite can be found in pig, bear, walrus, fox, rat, horse, and lion.; Wild animals, especially carnivores (meat eaters) or omnivores (animals that eat both meat and plants), should be considered possible sources of roundworm disease. Domestic meat animals raised specifically for eating under US Department of Agriculture (government) guidelines and inspection can be considered safe. For this reason, trichinosis is rare in the United States, but it is a common infection worldwide.; When a person eats meat from an infected animal, trichinella cysts break open in the intestine and grow into adult roundworms. The roundworms produce other worms that move through the gut wall and into the bloodstream. The worms invade muscle tissues, including the heart and diaphragm (the breathing muscle under the lungs). They can also infect the lungs and brain. The cysts can remain alive for years."
000632,Erysipeloid,Erysipelothricosis - erysipeloid; Skin infection - erysipeloid; Cellulitis - erysipeloid; Erysipeloid of Rosenbach; Diamond skin disease; Erysipelas,"Symptoms may develop in 2 to 7 days after bacteria enter the skin. Usually, the fingers and hands are affected. But any exposed area of the body can get infected if there is a break in the skin. Symptoms may include:; The infection may spread to other fingers. It usually doesn't spread past the wrist.; Bright red skin in the infected area; Swelling of the area; Throbbing pain with itching or burning sensation; Fluid-filled blisters; Low fever if the infection spreadsÂ; Swollen lymph nodes (sometimes)","The bacteria that cause erysipeloid are called Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. This type of bacteria may be found in fish, birds, mammals, and shellfish. Erysipeloid usually affects people who work with these animals (such as farmers, butchers, cooks, grocers, fishermen, or veterinarians). Infection results when the bacteria enters the skin through small breaks."
000633,Visceral larva migrans,Parasite infection - visceral larva migrans; VLM; Toxocariasis; Ocular larva migrans; Larva migrans visceralisÂ,"Mild infections may not cause symptoms.; Serious infections may cause these symptoms:; If the eyes are infected, loss of vision and crossed eyes can occur.; Abdominal pain; Cough, wheezing; Fever; Irritability; Itchy skin (hives); Shortness of breath","VLM is caused by roundworms (parasites) that are found in the intestines of dogs and cats.; Eggs produced by these worms are in the feces of the infected animals. The feces mix with soil. Humans can get sick if they accidentally eat soil that has the eggs in it. This can happen by eating fruit or vegetables that were in contact with infected soil and were not washed thoroughly before eating. People can also become infected by eating raw liver from a chicken, lamb, or cow.; Young children or people with pica are at high risk for getting VLM. Pica is a disorder involving eating inedible things such as dirt and paint. Most infections in the United States occur in children who play in areas such as sandboxes, which contain soil contaminated by dog or cat feces.; After the worm eggs are swallowed, they break open in the intestine. The worms travel throughout the body to various organs, such as the lungs, liver, and eyes. They may also travel to the brain and heart."

It provides feeling (sensation) to the front of the thigh and part of the lower leg.; A nerve is made up of many fibers, called axons, surrounded by insulation, called the myelin sheath.; Damage to any one nerve, such as the femoral nerve, is called mononeuropathy. Mononeuropathy is usually due to a local cause of damage to a single nerve. Disorders that involve the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage to one nerve at a time (such as occurs with mononeuritis multiplex).; More common causes of femoral nerve dysfunction are:; The femoral nerve can also be damaged from any of the following:; Direct injury (trauma); Prolonged pressure on the nerve; Compression, stretching, or entrapment of the nerve by nearby parts of the body or disease-related structures (such as a tumor or abnormal blood vessel); A broken pelvis bone; A catheter placed into the femoral artery in the groin; Diabetes or other causes of peripheral neuropathy; Internal bleeding in the pelvis or belly area (abdomen); Lying on the back with the thighs and legs flexed and turned (lithotomy position) during surgery or diagnostic procedures; Tight or heavy waist belts"
000688,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),Lou Gehrig disease; ALS; Upper and lower motor neuron disease; Motor neuron disease,"Symptoms usually do not develop until after age 50, but they can start in younger people. People with ALS have a loss of muscle strength and coordination that eventually gets worse and makes it impossible for them to do routine tasks such as going up steps, getting out of a chair, or swallowing.; Weakness can first affect the arms or legs, or the ability to breathe or swallow. As the disease gets worse, more muscle groups develop problems.; ALS does not affect the senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch). Most people are able to think normally, although a small number develop dementia, causing problems with memory.; Muscle weakness starts in one body part, such as the arm or hand, and slowly gets worse until it leads to the following:; Other findings include:; Difficulty lifting, climbing stairs, and walking; Difficulty breathing; Difficulty swallowing -- choking easily, drooling, or gagging; Head drop due to weakness of the neck muscles; Speech problems, such as a slow or abnormal speech pattern (slurring of words); Voice changes, hoarseness; Depression; Changing expressions of emotions (emotional lability); Muscle cramps; Muscle stiffness, called spasticity; Muscle contractions, called fasciculations; Weight loss","One in 10 cases of ALS is due to a genetic variant. The cause is unknown in most other cases.; In ALS, motor nerve cells (neurons) waste away or die, and can no longer send messages to muscles. This eventually leads to muscle weakening, twitching, and an inability to move the arms, legs, and body. The condition continues to get worse. When the muscles in the chest area stop working, it becomes hard or impossible to breathe.; ALS affects approximately 7 out of every 100,000 people worldwide.; Having a family member who has a hereditary form of the disease is a risk factor for ALS. Other risks include military service. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may have to do with environmental exposure to toxins."
000689,Axillary nerve dysfunction,Neuropathy - axillary nerve,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Numbness over part of the outer shoulder; Pain in the shoulder region; Shoulder weakness, especially when lifting the arm up and away from the body","Axillary nerve dysfunction is a form of peripheral neuropathy. It occurs when there is damage to the axillary nerve. This is the nerve that helps control the deltoid muscles of the shoulder and the skin around it. A problem with just one nerve, such as the axillary nerve, is called mononeuropathy.; The usual causes are:; Entrapment creates pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow structure.; The damage can destroy the myelin sheath that covers the nerve or part of the nerve cell (the axon). Damage of either type reduces or prevents the movement of signals through the nerve.; Conditions that can lead to axillary nerve dysfunction include:; In some cases, no cause can be found.; Direct injury; Long-term pressure on the nerve; Pressure on the nerve from nearby body structures (entrapment); Shoulder injury; Body-wide (systemic) disorders that cause nerve inflammation; Deep infection; Fracture of the upper arm bone (humerus); Pressure from casts or splints; Improper use of crutches; Shoulder dislocation"
000690,Cranial mononeuropathy VI,Abducens paralysis; Abducens palsy; Lateral rectus palsy; VIth nerve palsy; Cranial nerve VI palsy; Sixth nerve palsy; Neuropathy - sixth nerve,"When the sixth cranial nerve doesn't work properly, you can't turn your eye outward toward your ear. You can still move your eye up, down, and toward the nose, unless other nerves are affected.; Symptoms may include:; Double vision when looking to one side; Headaches; Pain around the eye","Cranial mononeuropathy VI is damage to the sixth cranial nerve. This nerve is also called the abducens nerve. It helps you move your eye sideways toward your temple.; Disorders of this nerve can occur with:; While rare, it can also be present at birth (congenital).; The exact cause of vaccination-related cranial nerve palsy in children is not known.; Because there are common nerve pathways through the skull, the same disorder that damages the sixth cranial nerve may affect other cranial nerves (such as the third or fourth cranial nerve).; Brain aneurysms; Nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy); Gradenigo syndrome (which also causes discharge from the ear and eye pain); Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (inflammation of the area behind the eye); Increased or decreased pressure in the skull; Infections (such as meningitis or sinusitis); Multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord; Pregnancy; Stroke; Trauma (caused by head injury or accidentally during surgery); Tumors around or behind the eye"
000691,Distal median nerve dysfunction,Neuropathy - distal median nerve,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Pain in the wrist or hand that may be severe and wake you up at night, and that may be felt in other areas, such as the upper arm (this is called referred pain); Sensation changes in the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring fingers, such as a burning feeling, decreased sensation, numbness and tingling; Weakness of the hand that causes you to drop things or have difficulty grasping objects or buttoning a shirt","Dysfunction of one nerve group, such as the distal median nerve, is called a mononeuropathy. Mononeuropathy usually means there is a local cause of the nerve damage. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.; This condition occurs when the nerve is inflamed, trapped, or injured by trauma. The most common reason is trapping (entrapment) by a ligament in the wrist. This causes carpal tunnel syndrome. Trapping puts pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow area. Wrist fractures may injure the median nerve directly. Or, it may increase the risk for trapping the nerve later on.; Inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) or joints (arthritis) can also put pressure on the nerve. Some repetitive movements increase the chance of developing carpal tunnel entrapment. Women are more affected than men.; Problems that affect the tissue near the nerve or cause deposits to form in the tissue can block blood flow and lead to pressure on the nerve. Such conditions include:; In some cases, no cause can be found. Diabetes can make this condition worse.; Too much growth hormone in the body (acromegaly); Diabetes; Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism); Kidney disease; A blood cancer called multiple myeloma; Pregnancy; Obesity; Amyloidosis"

This disorder affects the third cranial nerve in the skull. This is one of the cranial nerves that control eye movement and the pupil of the eye.; This type of damage may occur along with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Cranial mononeuropathy III is the most common cranial nerve disorder in people with diabetes. It is due to damage to the small blood vessels that feed the nerve.; Cranial mononeuropathy III can also occur in people who don't have diabetes.
000693,Diabetes and nerve damage,Diabetic neuropathy; Diabetes - neuropathy; Diabetes - peripheral neuropathy,"Symptoms often develop slowly over many years. The types of symptoms you have depend on the nerves that are affected.; Nerves in the feet and legs are most often affected. Symptoms often start in the toes and feet, and include tingling or burning, or deep pain. Over time, nerve damage can also occur in the fingers and hands. As the damage gets worse, you may lose feeling in your toes, feet, and legs. Your skin may become numb. Because of this, you may:; When the nerves that control digestion are affected, you may have trouble digesting food due to reduced movement of the stomach (gastroparesis). This can make your diabetes harder to control. Damage to nerves that control digestion almost always occurs in people with severe nerve damage in their feet and legs. Symptoms of digestion problems include:; When nerves in your heart and blood vessels are damaged, you may:; Other symptoms of nerve damage are:; Not notice when you step on something sharp; Not know that you have a blister or small cut; Not notice when your feet or hands touch something that is too hot or cold; Have feet that are very dry and cracked; Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food; Heartburn and bloating; Nausea, constipation, or diarrhea; Swallowing problems; Throwing up undigested food a few hours after a meal; Feel lightheaded when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension); Have a fast heart rate; Not notice angina, the chest pain that warns of heart disease and heart attack; Sexual problems, which cause trouble getting an erection in men and vaginal dryness or orgasm problems in women.; Not being able to tell when your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycemia unawareness).; Bladder problems, which cause urine leakage or not being able to empty the bladder.; Sweating too much, even when the temperature is cool, when you're at rest, or at other unusual times.; Feet that are very sweaty (early nerve damage).","In people with diabetes, the body's nerves can be damaged by decreased blood flow and a high blood sugar (glucose) level. This condition is more likely when the blood sugar level is not well controlled over time.; About one half of people with diabetes develop nerve damage. Symptoms often do not begin until many years after diabetes has been diagnosed. Some people who have diabetes that develops slowly already have nerve damage when they are first diagnosed.; People with diabetes are also at higher risk for other nerve problems not caused by their diabetes. These other nerve problems won't have the same symptoms and will progress in a different manner than nerve damage caused by diabetes."
000694,Epilepsy,Seizure disorder; Epileptic - epilepsy,"Symptoms vary from person to person. Some people may have simple staring spells. Others have violent shaking and loss of alertness (convulsion). The type of seizure depends on the part of the brain that is affected.; Most of the time, for people with epilepsy, their seizures are similar to ones before it. Some people with epilepsy have a strange sensation before each seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, or emotional changes. This is called an aura.; Your health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure you may have:; Absence seizures (also called non-motor seizures) include seizures involving a change in behavior but without changes in motor movement (such as staring spells). They may occur along with generalized seizures.; Focal onset seizures may occur with no change in awareness. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain is affected. These seizures may spread to the whole brain.; Generalized seizures involve both sides of the brain and cause impaired awareness. Abnormal movements involving the whole body are often present. Clenching of the jaw and losing control of the urine or bowels may occur.","Epilepsy occurs when changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain cells send out abnormal electrical signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures. (A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.); Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or, the cause may be unknown (idiopathic).; Common causes of epilepsy include:; Epileptic seizures can happen to anyone at any age. However, they're more common in young children and people age 65 years and older. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy.; Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); Dementia, such as Alzheimer disease; Traumatic brain injury; Infections, including brain abscess, meningitis, encephalitis, and HIV/AIDS; Brain problems that are present at birth (congenital brain defect); Brain injury that occurs during or near birth; Metabolism disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria); Brain tumor; Abnormal blood vessels in the brain; Other illness that damages or destroys brain tissue; Seizure disorders that run in families (hereditary epilepsy)"
000695,Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure,Seizure - tonic-clonic; Seizure - grand mal; Grand mal seizure; Seizure - generalized; Epilepsy - generalized seizure,"Many people with generalized bilateral tonic-clonic seizures have an aura with one or more symptoms before the seizure such as:; Some people have a focal onset seizure (only affecting one part of the body) that becomes a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure.; The seizures often result in rigid muscles (tonic phase). This is followed by violent muscle contractions (clonic phase). Other symptoms that occur during the seizure may include:; After the seizure, the person may have:; Vision, taste, smell, or sensory changes.; Seeing, smelling, or sometimes hearing things that are not there (hallucinations).; Dizziness or other symptoms.; Biting the cheek or tongue; Clenched teeth or jaw; Loss of urine or stool control (incontinence); Stopped breathing or difficulty breathing; Blue skin color (cyanosis); Confusion; Drowsiness or sleepiness that lasts for 1 hour or longer (called the post-ictal state); Loss of memory (amnesia) about the seizure episode; Headache; Weakness of one side of the body for a few minutes to a few hours following seizure (called Todd paralysis)","Seizures result from electrical overactivity in the brain. Bilateral tonic-clonic seizures may occur in people of any age. They can occur once (single episode). Or, they can occur as part of a repeated, chronic illness (epilepsy). Some seizures are due to psychological problems (psychogenic or non-epileptic)."

They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may:; Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures.; During the seizure, the person may:; The person usually does not fall during the seizure.; Right after the seizure, the person is usually:; Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include:; Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable.; Occur many times a day; Occur for weeks to months before being noticed; Interfere with school and learning; Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior; Stop walking and start again a few seconds later; Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later; Wide awake; Thinking clearly; Unaware of the seizure; Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing; Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities","Seizures result from overactivity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 4 to 12 years.; In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates).; They may also occur with other types of seizures, such as bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures)."
000697,Focal seizure,Jacksonian seizure; Seizure - partial (focal); Temporal lobe seizure; Epilepsy - partial seizures; Partial (focal) seizure,"People with focal, awareness impaired seizures may or may not remember any or all of the symptoms or events during the seizure.; Depending on where in the brain the seizure starts, symptoms may include:; Other symptoms may include:; Abnormal muscle contraction, such as abnormal head or limb movements; Staring spells, sometimes with repetitive movements such as picking at clothes or lip smacking; Eyes moving from side to side; Abnormal sensations, such as numbness, tingling, crawling sensation (like ants crawling on the skin); Seeing, smelling, or sometimes hearing things that are not there (hallucinations); Abdominal pain or discomfort; Nausea; Sweating; Flushed face; Dilated pupils; Rapid heart rate/pulse; Blackout spells, periods of time lost from memory; Changes in vision; Sensation of dÃ©jÃ  vu (feeling like current place and time have been experienced before); Changes in mood or emotion; Temporary inability to speak","Focal seizures are the most common type of seizure in people 1 year and older. In people older than 65 who have blood vessel disease of the brain or brain tumors, focal seizures are very common. Focal seizures are usually associated with an area of the brain in which nerve cells are easily excitable. This is often due to brain injury that can result from conditions such as stroke, infection, trauma, or from problems present at birth."
000698,Cranial mononeuropathy III,Third cranial nerve palsy; Oculomotor palsy; Pupil-involving third cranial nerve palsy; Mononeuropathy - compression type,"Symptoms may include:; Other symptoms may occur if the cause is a tumor or swelling of the brain.

Up to 10% to 20% of people have pituitary tumors. Many of these tumors do not cause symptoms and are never diagnosed during the person's lifetime.; The pituitary is part of the endocrine system. The pituitary helps control the release of hormones from other endocrine glands, such as the thyroid, sex glands (testes or ovaries), and adrenal glands. The pituitary also releases hormones that directly affect body tissues, such as bones and the breast milk glands. The pituitary hormones include:; As a pituitary tumor grows, the normal hormone-releasing cells of the pituitary may be damaged. This results in the pituitary gland not producing enough of its hormones. This condition is called hypopituitarism.; The causes of pituitary tumors are unknown. Some tumors are caused by hereditary disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia I (MEN I).; The pituitary gland can be affected by other brain tumors that develop in the same part of the brain (skull base), resulting in similar symptoms.; Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); Growth hormone (GH); Prolactin; Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)"

It worsens quickly. Other muscular dystrophies (including Becker muscular dystrophy) get worse much more slowly.; Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition.; The condition most often affects boys due to the way the disease is inherited. The sons of women who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene, but no symptoms themselves) each have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers. Very rarely, a female can be affected by the disease.; Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about 1 out of every 3,600 male infants. Because this is an inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
000706,Becker muscular dystrophy,Benign pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy; Becker's dystrophy,"Females rarely develop symptoms. Males will develop symptoms if they inherit the defective gene. Symptoms most often appear in boys between ages 5 and 15, but may begin later.; Muscle weakness of the lower body, including the legs and pelvis area, slowly gets worse, causing:; Other symptoms may include:; Difficulty walking that gets worse over time; by age 25 to 30, the person is usually unable to walk; Frequent falls; Difficulty getting up from the floor and climbing stairs; Difficulty with running, hopping, and jumping; Loss of muscle mass; Toe walking; Muscle weakness in the arms, neck, and other areas is not as severe as in the lower body; Breathing problems; Cognitive problems (these do not get worse over time); Fatigue; Loss of balance and coordination","Becker muscular dystrophy is very similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The main difference is that it gets worse at a much slower rate and it is less common. This disease is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes a protein called dystrophin.; The disorder is passed down through families (inherited). Having a family history of the condition raises your risk.; Becker muscular dystrophy occurs in about 3 to 6 out of every 100,000 births. The disease is found mostly in boys."

However, it is not uncommon for symptoms to appear much later in life. In some cases, symptoms never develop.; Symptoms are most often mild and very slowly become worse. Muscle weakness of the face is common, and may include:; Shoulder muscle weakness causes deformities such as pronounced shoulder blades (scapular winging) and sloping shoulders. The person has difficulty raising their arms because of shoulder and arm muscle weakness.; Weakness of the lower legs is possible as the disorder gets worse. This interferes with ability to play sports because of decreased strength and poor balance. The weakness can be severe enough to interfere with walking. A small percentage of people use a wheelchair.; Chronic pain is present in 50% to 80% of people with this type of muscular dystrophy.; Hearing loss and abnormal heart rhythms may occur, but are rare.; Eyelid drooping; Inability to whistle due to weakness of the cheek muscles; Decreased facial expression due to weakness of facial muscles; Depressed or angry facial expression; Difficulty pronouncing words; Difficulty reaching above the shoulder level","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a genetic disease due to a chromosome mutation. It appears in both men and women. It may develop in a child if either parent carries the gene for the disorder.

The condition may occur with a lack of color (pigmentation) of the iris (colored part of the eye).; Injury to the carotid artery, one of the main arteries to the brain; Injury to nerves at the base of the neck called the brachial plexus or nerve roots; Migraine or cluster headaches; Stroke, tumor, or other damage to a part of the brain called the brainstem; Tumor or infection in the top of the lung, between the lungs, and neck; Injections or surgery done to interrupt the nerve fibers and relieve pain (sympathectomy); Spinal cord injury"
000709,Migraine,Headache - migraine; Vascular headache - migraine,"There are two main types of migraines:; An aura is a group of nervous system (neurologic) symptoms. These symptoms are considered a warning sign that a migraine is coming. Most often, the vision is affected and can include any or all of the following:; Other nervous system symptoms include yawning, difficulty concentrating, nausea, trouble finding the right words, dizziness, weakness, numbness, and tingling. Some of these symptoms are much less common with migraine headaches. If you have any of these symptoms, your provider will likely order tests to find the cause.; An aura often occurs 10 to 15 minutes before the headache, but can occur just a few minutes to 24 hours before. A headache does not always follow an aura.; The headaches usually:; Other symptoms that may occur with the headache include:; Symptoms may linger, even after the migraine goes away. This is called a migraine hangover. Symptoms can include:; Migraine with aura (classic migraine); Migraine without aura (common migraine); Temporary blind spots or colored spots; Blurred vision; Eye pain; Seeing stars, zigzag lines, or flashing lights; Tunnel vision (only able to see objects close to the center of the field of view); Start as a dull ache and get worse within minutes to hours; Are throbbing, pounding, or pulsating; Are worse on one side of the head with pain behind the eye or in the back of the head and neck; Last 4 to 72 hours; Chills; Increased urination; Fatigue; Loss of appetite; Nausea and vomiting; Sensitivity to light or sound; Sweating; Feeling mentally dull, like your thinking is not clear or sharp; Needing more sleep; Neck pain","A migraine headache is caused by abnormal brain activity. This activity can be triggered by many things. But the exact chain of events remains unclear. Most medical experts believe the attack begins in the brain and involves nerve pathways and chemicals. The changes affect blood flow in the brain and surrounding tissues.; Migraine headaches tend to first appear between the ages of 10 and 45. Sometimes, they begin earlier or later. Migraines may run in families. Migraines occur more often in women than men. Some women, but not all, have fewer migraines when they are pregnant.; Migraine attacks may be triggered by any of the following:; Migraines can also be triggered by certain foods. Most common are:; True migraine headaches are not a result of a brain tumor or other serious medical problem. Only your health care provider can determine if your symptoms are due to a migraine disorder or other condition.; Caffeine withdrawal; Changes in hormone levels during a woman's menstrual cycle or with the use of birth control pills; Changes in sleep patterns, such as not getting enough sleep; Drinking alcohol; Exercise or other physical stress; Loud noises or bright lights; Missed meals; Odors or perfumes; Smoking or exposure to smoke; Stress and anxiety; Chocolate; Dairy foods, especially certain cheeses; Foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG); Foods with tyramine, which includes red wine, aged cheese, smoked fish, chicken livers, figs, and certain beans; Fruits (avocado, banana, citrus fruit); Meats containing nitrates (bacon, hot dogs, salami, cured meats); Onions; Peanuts and other nuts and seeds; Processed, fermented, pickled, or marinated foods"
000710,Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome,Myasthenic syndrome; Eaton-Lambert syndrome; Lambert-Eaton syndrome; LES,"Weakness or loss of movement that can be more or less severe, including:; Weakness is generally mild in LEMS. Leg muscles are mostly affected. Weakness may improve after exercise, but continuous exertion causes fatigue in some cases.; Symptoms related to the other parts of the nervous system often occur, and may include:; Difficulty climbing stairs, walking, or lifting things; Muscle pain; Drooping of the head; The need to use the hands to get up from a sitting or lying position; Problems talking; Problems chewing or swallowing, which may include gagging or choking; Vision changes, such as blurry vision, double vision, and problem keeping a steady gaze; Blood pressure changes; Dizziness upon standing; Dry mouth; Erectile dysfunction; Dry eyes; Constipation; Decreased sweating","LEMS is an autoimmune disorder. This means your immune system mistakenly targets healthy cells and tissues in the body. With LEMS, antibodies produced by the immune system attack nerve cells. This makes nerves cells unable to release enough of a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical transmits impulses between nerves and muscles. The result is muscle weakness.; LEMS may occur with cancers such as small cell lung cancer or autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo, which leads to a loss of skin pigment.; LEMS affects men more often than women. The most common age of occurrence is around age 60 years. LEMS is rare in children."
000711,Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies,Muscular dystrophy - limb-girdle type (LGMD),"Most often, the first sign is pelvic muscle weakness. Examples of this include trouble standing from a sitting position without using the arms, or difficulty climbing stairs. The weakness starts in childhood to young adulthood.; Other symptoms include:; Abnormal, sometimes waddling, walk; Joints that are fixed in a contracted position (late in the disease); Large and muscular-looking calves (pseudohypertrophy), which are not actually strong; Loss of muscle mass, thinning of certain body parts; Low back pain; Palpitations or passing-out spells; Shoulder weakness; Weakness of the muscles in the face (later in the disease); Weakness in the muscles of the lower legs, feet, lower arms, and hands (later in the disease)","Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies are a large group of genetic diseases in which there is muscle weakness and wasting (muscular dystrophy).; In most cases, both parents must pass on the non-working (defective) gene for a child to have the disease (autosomal recessive inheritance). In some rare types, only one parent needs to pass on the non-working gene to affect the child. This is called autosomal dominant inheritance. For most of these conditions, the defective gene has been discovered.; An important risk factor is having a family member with muscular dystrophy."
000712,Myasthenia gravis,Neuromuscular disorder - myasthenia gravis,"Myasthenia gravis causes weakness of the voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control. Autonomic muscles of the heart and digestive tract are usually not affected. The muscle weakness of myasthenia gravis worsens with activity and improves with rest.; This muscle weakness can lead to a variety of symptoms, including:; Double vision and drooping eyelids (ptosis) are the most common first symptoms; Breathing difficulty because of weakness of the chest wall muscles; Chewing or swallowing difficulty, causing frequent gagging, choking, or drooling; Difficulty climbing stairs, lifting objects, or rising from a seated position; Difficulty talking; Drooping head; Facial paralysis or weakness of the facial muscles; Fatigue; Hoarseness or changing voice; Difficulty maintaining steady gaze","Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder. An autoimmune disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Antibodies are proteins made by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly considers healthy tissue to be a harmful substance, such as in the case of myasthenia gravis. In people with myasthenia gravis, the body produces antibodies that block the muscle cells from receiving messages (conveyed by neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells.; In some cases, myasthenia gravis is linked to tumors of the thymus (an organ of the immune system).; Myasthenia gravis can affect people at any age. It is most common in young women and older men."
000713,Subdural hematoma,Subdural hemorrhage; Traumatic brain injury - subdural hematoma; TBI - subdural hematoma; Head injury - subdural hematoma,"Depending on the size of the hematoma and where it presses on the brain, any of the following symptoms may occur:; In infants, symptoms may include:; Drowsiness, confusion, or coma; Decreased memory; Problem speaking or swallowing; Problems with balance or walking; Headache; Seizures or loss of consciousness; Nausea and vomiting; Weakness or numbness of arms, legs, face; Vision problems; Behavioral changes or psychosis; Bulging fontanelles (the soft spots of the baby's skull); Separated sutures (the areas where growing skull bones join); Feeding problems; Seizures; High-pitched cry, irritability; Increased head size (circumference); Increased sleepiness or lethargy; Persistent vomiting","A subdural hematoma is most often the result of a severe head injury. This type of subdural hematoma is among the deadliest of all head injuries. The bleeding fills the brain area very rapidly, compressing brain tissue. This often results in brain injury and may lead to death.; With any subdural hematoma, tiny veins between the surface of the brain and its outer covering (the dura) stretch and tear, allowing blood to collect. In older adults, the veins are often already stretched because of brain shrinkage (atrophy) and are more easily injured.; A chronic subdural hematoma is more often seen in older adults. This type of subdural hematoma may be due to blood that persists after an acute injury or the result of slowly leaking blood. These can occur after a minor head injury and may go unnoticed for many days.; Some subdural hematomas occur without cause (spontaneously).; The following increase the risk for a subdural hematoma:; In infants and young children, a subdural hematoma may occur after child abuse and are commonly seen in a condition called shaken baby syndrome.; Medicines that thin the blood (such as warfarin or aspirin); Long-term alcohol use; Medical conditions that make your blood clot poorly; Repeated head injury, such as from falls; Very young or very old age"
000714,Alcoholic neuropathy,Neuropathy - alcoholic; Alcoholic polyneuropathy,"Symptoms of this condition include any of the following:; Changes in muscle strength or sensation usually occur on both sides of the body and are more common in the legs than in the arms. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time.; Numbness in the arms and legs; Abnormal sensations, such as ""pins and needles""; Painful sensations in the arms and legs; Muscle problems, including weakness, cramps, aches, or spasms; Heat intolerance, especially after exercise; Erection problems (impotence); Problems urinating, incontinence (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate; Constipation or diarrhea; Nausea, vomiting; Problems swallowing or talking; Unsteady gait (walking)","The exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown. It likely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition.; In severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved."
000716,Cerebral palsy,Spastic paralysis; Paralysis - spastic; Spastic hemiplegia; Spastic diplegia; Spastic quadriplegia,"Symptoms of CP can be very different between people with this group of disorders. Symptoms may:; Symptoms are usually seen before a child is 2 years old. Sometimes symptoms begin as early as 3 months. Parents may notice that their child is delayed in reaching developmental stages such as sitting, rolling, crawling, or walking.; There are several different types of cerebral palsy. Some people have a mix of symptoms.; Spastic CP is the most common type. Symptoms include:; The following symptoms may occur in other types of CP:; Other brain and nervous system symptoms may include:; Eating and digestion symptoms:; Other symptoms:; Be very mild or very severe; Only involve one side of the body or both sides; Be more pronounced in either the arms or legs, or involve both the arms and legs; Muscles that are very tight and do not stretch.

Most of these problems occur as the baby grows in the womb. But they can happen at any time during the first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing.; In some people with cerebral palsy, parts of the brain are injured due to a low level of oxygen (hypoxia) in those areas. It is not known why this occurs.; Premature infants have a slightly higher risk of developing CP. It may also occur in early infancy as a result of certain conditions such as:; In some cases, the cause of CP is never determined.; Bleeding in the brain; Brain infections (encephalitis, meningitis, herpes simplex infections); Head injury; Infections in the mother during pregnancy (rubella); Untreated jaundice; Injuries to the brain during the childbirth process; Exposure to toxins while developing (mercury)"
000719,Cerebral amyloid angiopathy,Amyloidosis - cerebral; CAA; Congophilic angiopathy,"CAA can cause bleeding into the brain. Bleeding often occurs in the outer parts of the brain, called the cortex, and not the deep areas. Symptoms occur because bleeding in the brain harms brain tissue. Some people have gradual memory problems. When a CT scan is done, there are often signs that they have had bleeding in the brain that they may not have realized.; If there is a lot of bleeding, immediate symptoms occur and resemble a stroke. These symptoms include:; If bleeding is not severe or widespread, symptoms can include:; Drowsiness; Headache (usually in a certain part of the head); Nervous system changes that may start suddenly, including confusion, delirium, double vision, decreased vision, sensation changes, speech problems, weakness, or paralysis; Seizures; Stupor or coma (rarely); Vomiting; Episodes of confusion; Headaches that come and go; Loss of mental function (dementia); Weakness or unusual sensations that come and go, and involve smaller areas; Seizures","People with CAA have deposits of amyloid protein in the walls of blood vessels in the brain. The protein is usually not deposited anywhere else in the body.; The major risk factor is increasing age. CAA is more often seen in people older than 55. Sometimes, it is passed down through families."
000720,Neurosarcoidosis,Sarcoidosis - nervous system,"The symptoms vary. Any part of the nervous system can be affected. Involvement of the brain or cranial nerves can cause:; Involvement of the pituitary gland can cause:; Involvement of one or more peripheral nerves can lead to:; Confusion, disorientation; Decreased hearing; Dementia; Dizziness, vertigo, or abnormal sensations of movement; Double vision or other vision problems, including blindness; Facial palsy (weakness, drooping); Headache; Loss of sense of smell; Loss of sense of taste, abnormal tastes; Mental disturbances; Seizures; Speech impairment; Changes in menstrual periods; Excessive tiredness or fatigue; Excessive thirst; High urine output; Weight changes; Hair changes; Abnormal sensations in any body part; Loss of movement of any body part; Loss of sensation in any body part; Weakness of any body part","Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease that affects many parts of the body, mostly the lungs. In a small number of people, the disease involves some part of the nervous system. This is called neurosarcoidosis.; Neurosarcoidosis may affect any part of the nervous system. Sudden facial weakness (facial palsy or facial droop) is a common neurological symptom that involves the nerves to the muscles of the face. Any other nerve in the skull can be affected, including those in the eye and those that control taste, smell, or hearing.; The spinal cord is another part of the nervous system that sarcoidosis can affect. People may have weakness in their arms and legs, and difficulty walking or controlling their urine or bowels. In some cases, the spinal cord is so severely affected that both legs are paralyzed.; The condition can also affect the parts of the brain involved in regulating many bodily functions, such as temperature, sleep, and stress responses.Â Other areas of the brain, including the pituitary gland at the base of the brain, can be affected.; Involvement of muscles or peripheralÂ nerves can cause weakness and sensory loss.Â"
000723,Subacute combined degeneration,Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord; SCD,"Symptoms include:; These symptoms slowly get worse and are usually felt on both sides of the body.; As the disease worsens, symptoms may include any of the following:; Abnormal sensations (tingling and numbness); Weakness of the legs, arms, or other areas; Clumsiness, stiff or awkward movements.; Mental changes, which can range from mild memory problems, irritability, apathy, and confusion, to severe dementia and psychosis. Severe dementia is uncommon, but in some cases it's the first symptom of the disorder.; Decreased vision.; Depression.; Sleepiness.; Unsteady gait and loss of balance.; Falls due to poor balance.","SCD is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. It mainly affects the spinal cord. But its effects on the brain and the peripheral (body) nerves are the reason for the term ""combined."" At first, the nerve covering (myelin sheath) is damaged. Later, the entire nerve cell is affected.; Doctors do not know exactly how a lack of vitamin B12 damages the nerves. It is possible that the lack of this vitamin causes abnormal fatty acids to form around cells and nerves.; People are at high risk for this condition if vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed from their intestine or if they have:; Pernicious anemia, a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells due to vitamin B12 deficiency; Disorders of the small intestine, including Crohn disease; Problems absorbing nutrients, which can occur after gastrointestinal surgery, including weight loss surgery; Use of nitrous oxide (laughing gas), especially if used as a recreational drug"

Syphilis infections are mainly spread through sex with an infected person. Sometimes, they may be passed by nonsexual contact."
000725,Arterial insufficiency,,"Symptoms depend on where your arteries become narrowed:; If it affects your heart arteries, you may have chest pain (angina pectoris) or a heart attack.; If it affects your brain arteries, you may have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.; If it affects the arteries that bring blood to your legs, you may have frequent leg cramping when you walk called claudication.; If it affects the arteries in your belly area, you may have pain after you eat called abdominal angina (due to mesenteric ischemia).","One of the most common causes of arterial insufficiency is atherosclerosis or ""hardening of the arteries."" Fatty material (called plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries. This causes them to become narrow and stiff. As a result, it is hard for blood to flow through your arteries.; Blood flow may be suddenly stopped due to a blood clot. Clots can form on the plaque or less often travel from another place such as the heart or other artery (also called embolus)."
000726,Stroke,Cerebrovascular disease; CVA; Cerebral infarction; Cerebral hemorrhage; Ischemic stroke; Stroke - ischemic; Cerebrovascular accident; Stroke - hemorrhagic; Carotid artery - stroke,"Symptoms of stroke depend on which part of the brain is damaged. In some cases, a person may not know that a stroke has occurred.; Most of the time, symptoms develop suddenly and without warning. But symptoms may occur on and off for the first day or two. Symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke first happens, but they may slowly get worse.; A headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. The headache:; Other symptoms depend on how severe the stroke is, and what part of the brain is affected.

This may happen in two ways:; Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries.; A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include:; Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and warfarin (Coumadin) or has a bleeding disorder. Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke.; An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke.; High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. Other major risk factors are:; Stroke risk is also higher in:; Ischemic stroke; Hemorrhagic stroke; A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke.; A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke.; Aneurysm (weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out); Arteriovenous malformation (AVM; abnormal connection between the arteries and veins); Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; condition in which proteins called amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain); Irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation; Diabetes; Family history of stroke; Being male; High cholesterol; Increasing age, especially after age 55; Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke); Obesity; History of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time); People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries; People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, excessive use of alcohol, use recreational drugs, a high-fat diet, or lack of exercise; People who have a hereditary tendency to develop blood clots; Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35); Women who are pregnant have an increased risk while pregnant; Women who take hormone replacement therapy; Patent foramen ovale (PFO), a hole between the left and right atria (upper chambers) of the heart"

They may include:; Later, similar symptoms may appear in the arms and hands. These may include a claw-like hand.; Foot deformity (very high arch to feet); Foot drop (inability to point foot upward to hold it horizontal); Loss of lower leg muscle, which leads to skinny calves; Numbness in the foot or leg; ""Slapping"" gait (feet hit the floor hard when walking); Weakness of the hips, legs, or feet",Charcot-Marie-Tooth is one of the most common nerve-related disorders passed down through families (inherited). Changes to any of at least 40 genes can cause different forms of this disease.; The disease leads to damage or destruction to the covering (myelin sheath) around nerve fibers.
000729,Tabes dorsalis,Locomotor ataxia; Syphilitic myelopathy; Syphilitic myeloneuropathy; Myelopathy - syphilitic; Tabetic neurosyphilis,"Symptoms of tabes dorsalis are caused by damage to the nervous system.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is spread sexually.; When syphilis is untreated, the bacteria may damage the spinal cord and peripheral nervous tissue. This leads to the symptoms of tabes dorsalis.; Tabes dorsalis is now very rare because syphilis is usually treated early in the disease."
000730,Transient ischemic attack,Mini stroke; TIA; Little stroke; Cerebrovascular disease - TIA; Carotid artery - TIA,"Symptoms begin suddenly, last a short time (from a few minutes to 1 to 2 hours), and go away. They may occur again at a later time.; The symptoms of a TIA are the same as the symptoms of a stroke, and include:; Change in alertness (including sleepiness or unconsciousness); Changes in the senses (such as hearing, vision, taste, and touch); Mental changes (such as confusion, memory loss, difficulty writing or reading, trouble speaking or understanding others); Muscle problems (such as weakness, trouble swallowing, trouble walking); Dizziness or loss of balance and coordination; Lack of control over the bladder or bowels; Sensation problems (such as numbness or tingling on one side of the body)","A TIA is different than a stroke.

Other major risk factors are:; People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries are also more likely to have a TIA or stroke.; A blood clot in an artery of the brain; A blood clot that travels to the brain from somewhere else in the body (for example, from the heart); An injury to blood vessels; Narrowing of a blood vessel in the brain or leading to the brain; Irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation; Diabetes; Family history of stroke; Being male; High cholesterol; Tendency to have abnormal blood clotting; Increasing age, especially after age 55; Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of stroke); Smoking; Alcohol use; Recreational drug use; History of prior TIA or stroke"
000733,Tourette syndrome,Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; Tic disorders - Tourette syndrome; Tourette's syndrome,"Symptoms of Tourette syndrome are often first noticed during childhood, at about 6 years of age. Most children with Tourette syndrome also have other medical problems. These can include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), impulse control disorder, or depression.; The most common first symptom is a tic of the face. Other tics may follow. A tic is a sudden, fast, repeated movement or sound.; Symptoms of Tourette syndrome can range from tiny, minor movements (such as grunts, sniffling, or coughing) to constant movements and sounds that cannot be controlled.; Different types of tics can include:; Tics may occur many times a day. They tend to improve or get worse at different times. The tics may change with time. Symptoms often get worse before the mid-teen years.; Contrary to popular belief, only a small number of people use curse words or other inappropriate words or phrases (coprolalia).; Tourette syndrome is different from OCD. People with OCD feel as though they have to do the behaviors. Sometimes a person can have both Tourette syndrome and OCD.; Many people with Tourette syndrome can stop doing the tic for periods of time. But they find that the tic is stronger for a few minutes after they allow it to start again. Often, the tic slows or stops during sleep.; Arm thrusting; Eye blinking; Jumping; Kicking; Repeated throat clearing or sniffing; Shoulder shrugging","Tourette syndrome is named for Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described this disorder in 1885. The disorder is likely passed down through families.; The syndrome may be linked to problems in certain areas of the brain. It may have to do with chemical substances (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) that help nerve cells signal one another.; Tourette syndrome can be either severe or mild. Many people with very mild tics may not be aware of them and never seek medical help. Far fewer people have more severe forms of Tourette syndrome.; Tourette syndrome is 3 times as likely to occur in boys as in girls. There is a 50% chance that a person with Tourette syndrome will pass the gene onto his or her children, although the children may have no or fewer symptoms."

The bacteria that cause either condition can infect the eye. The bacteria can directly enter the eye (on a finger or other object), or air droplets that carry the bacteria can land on the eye.; Other infectious diseases may spread the same way, or through the bloodstream to the eye."
000737,Multiple sclerosis,MS; Demyelinating disease,"Symptoms vary because the location and severity of each attack can be different. Attacks can last for days, weeks, or months. Attacks are followed by remissions. These are periods of reduced symptoms or no symptoms. Fever, hot baths, sun exposure, and stress can trigger or worsen attacks.; Nerves in any part of the brain or spinal cord may be damaged. Because of this, MS symptoms can appear in many parts of the body.; Muscle symptoms:; Bowel and bladder symptoms:; Eye symptoms:; Numbness, tingling, or pain:; Other brain and nerve symptoms:; Sexual symptoms:; Speech and swallowing symptoms:; Fatigue is a common and bothersome symptom as MS progresses.

The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 to 40, but it can be seen at any age.; MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath. This sheath is the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow or stop.; The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body's immune cells attack the nervous system. This can occur along any area of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord.; It is unknown what exactly causes MS. The most common thought is that it is caused by a virus, a gene defect, or both. Environmental factors may also play a role.; You are slightly more likely to develop this condition if you have a family history of MS or you live in a part of the world where MS is more common (areas further from the equator)."

Vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease are the most common causes of dementia, and may occur together.; A stroke is brain damage due to a blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is also called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that more than one area in the brain has been injured due to a lack of blood.; If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage.; When strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms. These are called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of dementia appear.; Not all strokes are silent. Larger strokes that affect strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function can also lead to dementia.; Diabetes; Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis); Heart disease; High blood pressure (hypertension); Smoking; Stroke or other vascular disease"

When it occurs outside of the central nervous system (CNS), that is, the brain and spinal cord, it is called a peripheral neuropathy. Mononeuropathy means one nerve is involved. Polyneuropathy means that many nerves in different parts of the body are involved.; Neuropathy can affect nerves that provide feeling (sensory neuropathy) or cause movement (motor neuropathy). It can also affect both, in which case it is called a sensorimotor neuropathy.; Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is a bodywide (systemic) process that damages nerve cells, nerve fibers (axons), and nerve coverings (myelin sheath). Damage to the covering of the nerve cell causes nerve signals to slow or stop. Damage to the nerve fiber or entire nerve cell can make the nerve stop working. Some neuropathies develop over years, while others can start and get severe within hours to days.; Nerve damage can be caused by:; Some diseases lead to polyneuropathy that is mainly sensory or mainly motor.

000753,Spasmodic dysphonia,Dysphonia - spasmodic; Speech disorder - spasmodic dysphonia,"The voice is usually hoarse or grating. It may waver and pause. The voice may sound strained or strangled, and it may seem as if the speaker has to use extra effort. This is known as adductor dysphonia.; Sometimes, the voice is whispery or breathy. This is known as abductor dysphonia.; The problem may go away when the person laughs, whispers, speaks in a high-pitched voice, sings, or shouts.; Some people may also have muscle tone problems in other parts of the body, such as writer's cramp.","The exact cause of spasmodic dysphonia is unknown. Sometimes it is triggered by psychological stress. Most cases result from a problem in the brain and nervous system that can affect the voice. The vocal cord muscles spasm, or contract, which causes the vocal cords to get too close or too far apart while a person is using their voice, making it sound normal.; Spasmodic dysphonia often occurs between ages 30 and 50. Women are more likely to be affected than men.; Sometimes, the condition runs in the family."

They often include symptoms of urinary incontinence.; Symptoms of overactive bladder may include:; Symptoms of underactive bladder may include:; Having to urinate too often but in small amounts; Problems emptying all the urine from the bladder; Loss of bladder control; Full bladder and possibly urine leakage; Inability to tell when the bladder is full; Problems starting to urinate or emptying all the urine from the bladder (urinary retention),"Several muscles and nerves must work together for the bladder to hold urine until you are ready to empty it. Nerve messages go back and forth between the brain and the muscles that control bladder emptying. If these nerves are damaged by illness or injury, the muscles may not be able to tighten or relax at the right time.; Disorders of the central nervous system commonly cause neurogenic bladder. These can include:; Damage or disorders of the nerves that supply the bladder can also cause this condition.

With Parkinson disease, the brain cells that make dopamine slowly die. Without enough dopamine, the cells that control movement can't send proper messages to the muscles. This makes it hard to control the muscles. Slowly, over time, this damage gets worse. No one knows exactly why these brain cells waste away.; Parkinson disease most often develops after age 60. It is one of the most common nervous system problems in older adults.; The disease affects men more often than women, although women also develop the disease. Parkinson disease sometimes runs in families.; The disease can occur in younger adults. In such cases, it is often due to the person's genes.; Parkinson disease is rare in children."

Rarely, they can be a side effect of a medicine used for migraine headaches. Once spasms begin, they may continue off and on for a few days. Then, they disappear. Most people have this type of eyelid twitch once in a while and find it very annoying. In most cases, you won't even notice when the twitch has stopped.; You may have more severe contractions, where the eyelid completely closes. This form of eyelid twitching is called blepharospasm. It lasts much longer than the more common type of eyelid twitch. It is often very uncomfortable and may cause your eyelids to close completely. Twitching can be caused by irritation of the:; Sometimes, the reason your eyelid is twitching cannot be found.; Surface of the eye (cornea); Membranes lining the eyelids (conjunctiva)"
000757,Multiple system atrophy - parkinsonian type,Shy-Drager syndrome; Neurologic orthostatic hypotension; Shy-McGee-Drager syndrome; Parkinson plus syndrome; MSA-P; MSA-C,"MSA damages the nervous system.

This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified.; Late onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and older. It may run in some families, but the role of genes is less clear."
000762,Essential tremor,Tremor - essential; Familial tremor; Tremor - familial; Benign essential tremor; Shaking - essential tremor,"The tremor is more likely to be noticed in the forearm and hands. The arms, head, eyelids, or other muscles may also be affected. The tremor rarely occurs in the legs or feet.

Everyone has some tremor at times, but the movements are usually so small that they can't be seen. ET affects both men and women. It is most common in people older than 65 years.; The exact cause of ET is unknown. Research suggests that the part of the brain that controls muscle movements does not work correctly in people with ET.; If an ET occurs in more than one member of a family, it is called a familial tremor. This type of ET is passed down through families (inherited). This suggests that genes play a role in its cause.; Familial tremor is usually a dominant trait. This means that you only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the tremor. It often starts in early middle age, but may be seen in people who are older or younger, or even in children."

The defect causes a part of your DNA to occur many more times than it is supposed to. This defect is called a CAG repeat. Normally, this section of DNA is repeated 10 to 28 times. But in people with HD, it is repeated 36 to 120 times.; As the gene is passed down through families, the number of repeats tends to get larger. The larger the number of repeats, the higher a person's chance of developing symptoms at an earlier age. Therefore, as the disease is passed along in families, symptoms develop at younger and younger ages.; There are two forms of HD:; If one of your parents has HD, you have a 50% chance of getting the gene. If you get the gene from your parents, you can pass it on to your children, who will also have a 50% chance of getting the gene. If you do not get the gene from your parents, you cannot pass the gene on to your children.; Adult-onset is the most common. Persons with this form usually develop symptoms in their mid-30s or 40s.; Early-onset affects a small number of people and begins in childhood or the teens."
000771,Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome,Korsakoff psychosis; Alcoholic encephalopathy; Encephalopathy - alcoholic; Wernicke's disease; Alcohol use - Wernicke; Alcoholism - Wernicke; Thiamine deficiency - Wernicke,"Symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy include:; Symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome include:; Confusion and loss of mental activity that can progress to coma and death; Loss of muscle coordination (ataxia) that can cause leg tremor; Vision changes such as

Both are due to brain damage caused by a lack of vitamin B1.; Lack of vitamin B1 is common in people who have alcohol use disorder. It is also common in people whose bodies do not absorb food properly (malabsorption). This can sometimes occur with a chronic illness or after weight-loss (bariatric) surgery.; Korsakoff syndrome, or Korsakoff psychosis, tends to develop as Wernicke encephalopathy as symptoms go away. Wernicke encephalopathy causes brain damage in lower parts of the brain called the thalamus and hypothalamus. Korsakoff psychosis results from permanent damage to areas of the brain involved with memory."
000773,Bell palsy,Facial palsy; Idiopathic peripheral facial palsy; Cranial mononeuropathy - Bell palsy; Bell's palsy,"Sometimes, you may have a cold shortly before the symptoms of Bell palsy begin.; Symptoms most often start suddenly, but may take 2 to 3 days to become fully developed. They do not become more severe after that.; Symptoms are almost always on one side of the face only. They may range from mild to severe.; Many people feel discomfort behind the ear before weakness is noticed. The face feels stiff or pulled to one side and may look different. Other signs can include:; Other symptoms that may occur:; Difficulty closing one eye; Difficulty eating and drinking because food falls out of one side of the mouth; Drooling due to lack of control over the muscles of the face; Slurring your words (dysarthria) due to lip weakness; Drooping of the face, such as the eyelid or corner of the mouth; Problems smiling, grimacing, or making facial expressions; Twitching or weakness of the muscles in the face; Dry eye, which may lead to eye sores or infections; Dry mouth; Headache if there is an infection such as Lyme disease; Loss of sense of taste; Sound that is louder in one ear (hyperacusis)","Bell palsy can affect people of any age, most commonly those over age 65 years. It can also affect children younger than 10 years. Males and females are equally affected.; Bell palsy is thought to be due to swelling (inflammation) of the facial nerve in the area where it travels through the bones of the skull. This nerve controls movement of the muscles of the face.; The cause is often not clear. A type of herpes infection called herpes simplex or herpes zoster might be involved. Other conditions that may affect the seventh cranial nerve include:; Having diabetes and being pregnant may increase the risk for Bell palsy.; HIV/AIDS infection; Lyme disease; Middle ear infection; Sarcoidosis (inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, or other tissues)"
000774,Ethylene glycol poisoning,Intoxication - ethylene glycol,"The first symptom of ethylene glycol ingestion is similar to the feeling caused by drinking alcohol (ethanol). Within a few hours, more toxic effects become apparent. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, convulsions, stupor (decreased level of alertness), or even coma.; Ethylene glycol toxicity should be suspected in anyone who is severely ill after drinking an unknown substance, especially if they at first appear drunk and you can't smell alcohol on their breath.; An overdose of ethylene glycol can damage the brain, lungs, liver, and kidneys. The poisoning causes disturbances in the body's chemistry, including metabolic acidosis (increased acids in the bloodstream and tissues). The disturbances may be severe enough to cause profound shock, organ failure, and death.; As little as 120 milliliters (approximately 4 fluid ounces) of ethylene glycol may be enough to kill an average-sized man.",

Although the brainstem is mainly affected, other areas of the brain can also be involved.; The most common cause of ODS is a quick change in the body's blood sodium levels. This most often occurs when someone is being treated for low blood sodium (hyponatremia) and the sodium is replaced too fast. Sometimes, it occurs when a high level of sodium in the body (hypernatremia) is corrected too quickly.; ODS does not usually occur on its own. Most often, it's a complication of treatment for other problems, or from the other problems themselves.; Risks include:; Alcohol use; Liver disease; Malnutrition from serious illnesses; Radiation treatment of the brain; Severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy"

Polyneuropathy means several nerves are involved. CIDP often affects both sides of the body.; CIDP is caused by an abnormal immune response. CIDP occurs when the immune system attacks the myelin cover of the nerves. For this reason, CIDP is thought to be an autoimmune disease.; Health care providers also consider CIDP as the chronic form of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome.; The specific triggers of CIDP vary. In many cases, the cause cannot be identified.; CIDP may occur with other conditions, such as:; Chronic hepatitis; Diabetes; Infection with the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni; HIV/AIDS; Immune system disorders due to cancer; Inflammatory bowel disease; Systemic lupus erythematosus; Cancer of the lymph system; Overactive thyroid; Side effects of medicines to treat cancer or HIV"
000778,Acoustic neuroma,Vestibular schwannoma; Tumor - acoustic; Cerebellopontine angle tumor; Angle tumor; Hearing loss - acoustic; Tinnitus - acoustic,"The symptoms vary, based on the size and location of the tumor.

000779,Cerebral arteriovenous malformation,AVM - cerebral; Arteriovenous hemangioma; Stroke - AVM; Hemorrhagic stroke - AVM,"In about one half of people with AVMs, the first symptoms are those of a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain.; Symptoms of an AVM that is bleeding are:; Symptoms due to pressure on one area of the brain include:; Confusion; Ear noise/buzzing (also called pulsatile tinnitus); Headache in one or more parts of the head, may seem like a migraine; Problems walking; Seizures; Vision problems; Dizziness; Muscle weakness in an area of the body or face; Numbness in an area of the body","The exact cause of cerebral AVM is unknown, however growing evidence suggests a genetic cause. An AVM occurs when arteries in the brain connect directly to nearby veins without having the normal small vessels (capillaries) between them.; AVMs vary in size and location in the brain.; An AVM rupture occurs because of pressure and damage to the blood vessel. This allows blood to leak (hemorrhage) into the brain or surrounding tissues and reduces blood flow to the brain.; Cerebral AVMs are rare. Although the condition is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any age. Ruptures happen most often in people ages 15 to 20. It can also occur later in life. Some people with an AVM also have brain aneurysms."
000780,Mononeuropathy,Neuropathy; Isolated mononeuritis,"Symptoms depend on the specific nerve affected, and may include:; Loss of sensation; Paralysis; Tingling, burning, pain, abnormal sensations; Weakness","Mononeuropathy is a type of damage to a nerve outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral neuropathy).; Mononeuropathy is most often caused by injury. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.; Long-term pressure on a nerve due to swelling or injury can result in mononeuropathy. The covering of the nerve (myelin sheath) or part of the nerve cell (the axon) may be damaged. This damage slows or prevents signals from traveling through the damaged nerves.; Mononeuropathy may involve any part of the body. Some common forms of mononeuropathy include:; Axillary nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in the shoulder); Common peroneal nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in the foot and leg); Carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve dysfunction -- including numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage in the hand and fingers); Cranial mononeuropathy III, IV, compression or diabetic type; Cranial mononeuropathy VI (double vision); Cranial mononeuropathy VII (facial paralysis); Femoral nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in part of the leg); Radial nerve dysfunction (problems with movement in the arm and wrist and with sensation in the back of the arm or hand); Sciatic nerve dysfunction (problem with the muscles of the back of the knee and lower leg, and sensation to the back of the thigh, part of the lower leg, and sole of the foot); Ulnar nerve dysfunction (cubital tunnel syndrome -- including numbness, tingling, weakness of outer and underside of arm, palm, ring and little fingers)"
000781,Chronic subdural hematoma,Subdural hemorrhage - chronic; Subdural hematoma - chronic; Subdural hygroma,"In some cases, there may be no symptoms. However, depending on the size of the hematoma and where it presses on the brain, any of the following symptoms may occur:; Drowsiness, confusion, or coma; Decreased memory; Problem speaking or swallowing; Problems with balance or walking; Headache; Seizures or loss of consciousness; Weakness or numbness of arms, legs, face; Nausea and vomiting; Vision problems; Behavioral changes or psychosis","A subdural hematoma develops when bridging veins tear and leak blood. These are the tiny veins that run between the dura and surface of the brain. This is usually the result of a head injury.; A collection of blood then forms over the surface of the brain. In a chronic subdural collection, blood leaks from the veins slowly over time, or a fast hemorrhage is left to clear up on its own.; A subdural hematoma is more common in older adults because of normal brain shrinkage that occurs with aging. This shrinkage stretches and weakens the bridging veins. These veins are more likely to break in older adults, even after a minor head injury. You or your family may not remember any injury that might have caused a subdural hematoma.; Risks include:; Long-term heavy alcohol use; Long-term use of aspirin, anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen, or blood thinning (anticoagulant) medicine such as warfarin; Diseases that lead to reduced blood clotting; Head injury; Old age"
000782,Multiple mononeuropathy,Mononeuritis multiplex; Mononeuropathy multiplex; Multifocal neuropathy; Peripheral neuropathy - mononeuritis multiplex,"Symptoms depend on the specific nerves involved, and may include:; Loss of bladder or bowel control; Loss of sensation in one or more areas of the body; Paralysis in one or more areas of the body; Tingling, burning, pain, or other abnormal sensations in one or more areas of the body; Weakness in one or more areas of the body","Multiple mononeuropathy is a form of damage to one or more peripheral nerves. These are the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It is a group of symptoms (syndrome), not a disease.; However, certain diseases can cause the injury or nerve damage that leads to the symptoms of multiple mononeuropathy. Common conditions include:; Less common causes include:; Blood vessel diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa; Connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (the most common cause in children); Diabetes; Amyloidosis, an abnormal buildup of proteins in tissues and organs; Blood disorders (such as hypereosinophilia and cryoglobulinemia); Infections such as Lyme disease, HIV/AIDS, or hepatitis; Leprosy; Sarcoidosis, which also may cause inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, or other tissues; SjÃ¶gren syndrome, a disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed; Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, an inflammation of the blood vessel"

As a result, swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria or fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass or abscess.; The germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. Or, they enter the brain directly, such as during brain surgery. In some cases, a brain abscess develops from an infection in the sinuses.; The source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common identified source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is the cause.; The following raise your chance of developing a brain abscess:; A weakened immune system (such as in people with HIV/AIDS); Chronic disease, such as cancer; Drugs that suppress the immune system (corticosteroids or chemotherapy); Congenital heart disease"
000784,Amaurosis fugax,Transient monocular blindness; Transient monocular visual loss; TMVL; Transient monocular visual loss; Transient binocular visual loss; TBVL; Temporary visual loss - amaurosis fugax,"Symptoms include the sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. This usually lasts for a few seconds to several minutes. Afterward, vision returns to normal. Some people describe the loss of vision as a gray or black shade coming down over the eye.","Amaurosis fugax is not itself a disease. Instead, it is a sign of other disorders. Amaurosis fugax can occur from different causes. One cause is when a blood clot or a piece of plaque blocks an artery in the eye. The blood clot or plaque usually travels from a larger artery, such as the carotid artery in the neck or an artery in the heart, to an artery in the eye.; Plaque is a hard substance that forms when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. Risk factors include:; Amaurosis fugax can also occur because of other disorders such as:; Heart disease, especially irregular heartbeat; Alcohol abuse; Cocaine use; Diabetes; Family history of stroke; High blood pressure; High cholesterol; Increasing age; Smoking (people who smoke one pack a day double their risk for a stroke); Other eye problems, such as inflammation of the optic nerve (optic neuritis); Blood vessel disease called polyarteritis nodosa; Migraine headaches; Brain tumor; Head injury; Multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammation of the nerves due to the body's immune cells attacking the nervous system; Systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune cells attack healthy tissue throughout the body"

If both parents carry a non-working (variant) gene for Wilson disease, there is a 25% chance in each pregnancy that the child will have the disorder.; Wilson disease causes the body to take in and keep too much copper. The copper deposits in the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes. This causes tissue damage, tissue death, and scarring. The affected organs stop working normally.; This condition is most common in eastern Europeans, Sicilians, and southern Italians, but it may occur in any group. Wilson disease symptoms typically appear in people under 40 years old. Damage to the liver may begin in children by age 6, but clinical symptoms most often appear in people in their teens or early twenties."
000786,Cluster headache,Histamine headache; Headache - histamine; Migrainous neuralgia; Headache - cluster; Horton's headache; Vascular headache - cluster; Episodic cluster headache; Chronic cluster headache,"A cluster headache begins as a severe, sudden headache. The headache commonly strikes 2 to 3 hours after you fall asleep. But it can also occur when you are awake. The headache tends to happen daily at the same time of day. Attacks can last for months. They can alternate with periods without headaches (episodic) or they can go on for a year or more without stopping (chronic).; Cluster headache pain is usually:; When the eye and nose on the same side as the head pain are affected, symptoms can include:; Burning, sharp, stabbing, or steady; Felt on one side of the face from neck to temple, often involving the eye; At its worst within 5 to 10 minutes, with the strongest pain lasting 30 minutes to 2 hours; Swelling under or around the eye (may affect both eyes); Excessive tearing; Red eye; Droopy eyelid; Runny nose or stuffy nose on the same side as the head pain; Red, flushed face, with extreme sweating","Doctors do not know exactly what causes cluster headaches. They seem to be related to the body's sudden release of histamine (chemical in the body released during an allergic response) or serotonin (chemical made by nerve cells) in the area of a nerve in the face called the trigeminal nerve. A problem in a small area at the base of the brain called the hypothalamus may be involved.; More men than women are affected. The headaches can occur at any age, but are most common in the 20s through middle age. They tend to run in families.; Cluster headaches may be triggered by:; Alcohol; Cigarette smoking; High altitudes (trekking and air travel); Bright light (including sunlight); Exertion (physical activity); Heat (hot weather or hot baths); Foods high in nitrites (bacon and preserved meats); Certain medicines; Cocaine"
000787,Tuberous sclerosis,Bourneville disease; Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC),"Skin symptoms include:; Brain symptoms include:; Other symptoms include:; The symptoms vary from person to person. Some people have normal intelligence and no seizures. Others have intellectual disabilities or difficult-to-control seizures.; Areas of the skin that are white (due to decreased pigment) and have either an ash leaf or confetti appearance; Red patches on the face containing many blood vessels (facial angiofibromas); Raised patches of skin with an orange-peel texture (shagreen spots), often on the back; Autism spectrum disorders; Developmental delays; Intellectual disability; Seizures; Pitted tooth enamel.; Rough growths under or around the fingernails and toenails.; Rubbery noncancerous tumors on or around the tongue.; Lung disease known as LAM (lymphangioleiomyomatosis). This is more common in women. In many cases, there are no symptoms. In other people, this can lead to shortness of breath, coughing blood, and lung collapse.; A benign cardiac tumor known as a cardiac rhabdomyoma. This is common in children with tuberous sclerosis and can be seen on ultrasound before a baby is born.","Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition. Changes (non-working gene variants or mutations) in one of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, are responsible for most cases.; Only one parent needs to pass on the non-working gene for the child to get the disease. However, two-thirds of cases are due to new gene changes. In most cases, there is no family history of tuberous sclerosis.; This condition is one of a group of diseases called neurocutaneous syndromes. Both the skin and central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) are involved.; There are no known risk factors, other than having a parent with tuberous sclerosis. In that case, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease."

A prion causes normal proteins to fold abnormally. This affects other proteins' ability to function.; CJD is very rare. There are several types. The classic types of CJD are:; Sporadic CJD makes up most cases. It occurs for no known reason. It starts on average at age 65 years.; Familial CJD occurs when a person inherits the abnormal prion from a parent (this form of CJD is rare).; Acquired CJD includes variant CJD (vCJD), the form related to mad cow disease.; CJD may be related to several other diseases caused by prions, including:; Variant CJD is caused by eating infected meat. The infection that causes the disease in cows is thought to be the same one that causes vCJD in humans.; Variant CJD causes less than 1% of all CJD cases. It tends to affect younger people. Fewer than 200 people worldwide have had this disease. Almost all cases occurred in England and France.; Iatrogenic CJD is also an acquired form of the disease. Iatrogenic CJD is sometimes passed through a blood product transfusion, transplant, or contaminated surgical instruments.; Chronic wasting disease (found in deer); Kuru (affected mostly women in New Guinea who ate the brains of dead relatives as part of a funeral ritual); Scrapie (found in sheep); Other very rare inherited human diseases, such as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia"

Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.; Causes of mononeuropathy include:; Ulnar neuropathy is also common in those with diabetes.; Ulnar neuropathy occurs when there is damage to the ulnar nerve. This nerve travels down the arm to the wrist, hand, and ring and little fingers. It passes just under the surface of the skin near the elbow. So, bumping the nerve there causes the pain and tingling of hitting your funny bone.; When the nerve is compressed in the elbow, a problem called cubital tunnel syndrome may result. The ulnar nerve can also get compressed in the wrist and less often, at other parts of the arm.; When damage destroys the nerve covering (myelin sheath) or part of the nerve itself, nerve signaling is slowed or prevented. When the nerve fibers themselves (axons) are injured, this may cause a more severe problem.; Damage to the ulnar nerve can be caused by:; In some cases, no cause can be found.; An illness in the whole body that damages a single nerve; Direct injury to the nerve; Long-term pressure on the nerve; Pressure on the nerve caused by swelling or injury of nearby body structures; Long-term pressure on the elbow or base of the palm; An elbow fracture or dislocation; Keeping the elbow bent for a long time or repeated elbow bending, such as with repetitive movements at work, or cigarette smoking"

It supplies movement and sensation to the lower leg, foot and toes. Common peroneal nerve dysfunction is a type of peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage outside the brain or spinal cord). This condition can affect people of any age.; Common peroneal nerve is a type of mononeuropathy. Mononeuropathy is nerve damage to a single nerve. Certain body-wide conditions can also cause single nerve injuries.; Damage to the nerve disrupts the myelin sheath that covers the axon (branch of the nerve cell). The axon can also be injured, which is a more severe injury that causes similar symptoms.; Common causes of damage to the common peroneal nerve include the following:; Common peroneal nerve injury is often seen in people:; Trauma or injury to the knee; Fracture of the fibula (a bone of the lower leg); Use of a tight plaster cast (or other long-term constriction) of the lower leg; Crossing the legs regularly; Regularly wearing high boots; Pressure to the knee from positions during deep sleep or coma; Injury during knee surgery or from being placed in an awkward position during anesthesia; Who are very thin (for example, from anorexia nervosa); Who have certain autoimmune conditions, such as polyarteritis nodosa; Who have nerve damage from other medical problems, such as diabetes, excess alcohol use, or inherited nerve disorders"

This is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. An increase in intracranial pressure can also be due to a rise in pressure within the brain itself. This can be caused by a mass (such as a tumor), bleeding into the brain or fluid around the brain, or swelling of the brain.; An increase in intracranial pressure is a serious and life-threatening medical problem. The pressure can damage the brain or spinal cord by pressing on important structures and by restricting blood flow into the brain.; Many conditions can increase intracranial pressure.

They can be grouped into four main categories:; PROBLEMS FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP; Insomnia includes trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Episodes may come and go, last up to 3 weeks (be short-term), or be long-lasting (chronic).; PROBLEMS STAYING AWAKE; Hypersomnia is a condition in which people have excessive daytime sleepiness. This means they feel tired during the day and are prone to falling asleep. Hypersomnia can also include situations in which a person needs to sleep a lot. This may be due to other medical conditions, but can also be due to a problem in the brain. Causes of this problem include:; When no cause for the sleepiness can be found, it is called idiopathic hypersomnia.; PROBLEMS STICKING TO A REGULAR SLEEP SCHEDULE; Problems may also occur when you do not stick to a regular sleep and wake schedule. This occurs when people travel between time zones. It can also occur with shift workers who are on changing schedules, especially nighttime workers.; Disorders that involve a disrupted sleep schedule include:; SLEEP-DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIORS; Abnormal behaviors during sleep are called parasomnias. They are fairly common in children and include:; Problems falling or staying asleep (insomnia); Problems staying awake (excessive daytime sleepiness); Problems sticking to a regular sleep schedule (sleep rhythm problem); Unusual behaviors during sleep (sleep-disruptive behaviors); Medical conditions, such as fibromyalgia and low thyroid function; Medicines that are sedating; Mononucleosis or other viral illnesses; Narcolepsy and other sleep disorders; Obesity, especially if it causes obstructive sleep apnea; Irregular sleep-wake syndrome; Jet lag syndrome; Shift work sleep disorder; Delayed sleep phase, as in teenagers who go to sleep very late at night and then sleep until noon; Advanced sleep phase, as in older adults who go to sleep early in the evening and wake up very early; Sleep terrors; Sleepwalking; REM sleep-behavior disorder (a person moves during REM sleep and may act out dreams)"
000801,Sleep paralysis,Parasomnia - sleep paralysis; Isolated sleep paralysis,"The normal sleep cycle has stages, from light drowsiness to deep sleep. During the stage called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, your eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming is most common. Each night, people go through several cycles of non-REM and REM sleep. During REM sleep, your body is relaxed and your muscles don't move. Sleep paralysis occurs when the sleep cycle is shifting between stages. When you wake up suddenly from REM, your brain is awake, but your body is still in REM mode and can't move, causing you to feel like you're paralyzed.; Episodes of sleep paralysis last from a few seconds to 1 or 2 minutes. These spells end on their own or when you are touched or moved. In rare cases, you can have dream-like sensations or hallucinations, which may be scary.","Sleep paralysis is fairly common. Many people have at least one episode during their lifetimes.; The exact cause of sleep paralysis is not fully known.

000802,Narcolepsy,Daytime sleep disorder; Cataplexy,"Narcolepsy symptoms usually first occur between age 15 and 30 years. Below are the most common symptoms.; EXTREME DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; CATAPLEXY; HALLUCINATIONS; SLEEP PARALYSIS; Most people with narcolepsy have daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Not everyone has all these symptoms. Surprisingly, despite being very tired, many people with narcolepsy don't sleep well at night.; There are two main types of narcolepsy:; You may feel a strong urge to sleep, often followed by a period of sleep. You can't control when you fall asleep. This is called a sleep attack.; These periods can last from a few seconds to a few minutes.; They may happen after eating, while talking to someone, or during other situations.; Most often, you wake up feeling refreshed.; Attacks can occur while you are driving or doing other activities where falling asleep can be dangerous.; During these attacks, you can't control your muscles and can't move. Strong emotions, such as laughter or anger, can trigger cataplexy.; Attacks often last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. You remain aware during the attack.; During the attack, your head falls forward, your jaw drops, and your knees may buckle.; In severe cases, you may fall and stay paralyzed for as long as several minutes.; You see or hear things that aren't there, either as you fall asleep or when you wake up.; During hallucinations, you may feel afraid or under attack.; This is when you can't move your body as you start falling asleep or when you first wake up.; It may last up to 15 minutes.; Type 1 involves having excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and a low level of hypocretin.; Type 2 involves having excessive daytime sleepiness, but no cataplexy, and a normal level of hypocretin.","Experts aren't sure of the exact cause of narcolepsy. It may have more than one cause.; Many people with narcolepsy have a low level of hypocretin (also known as orexin). This is a chemical made in the brain that helps you stay awake. In some people with narcolepsy, there are fewer of the cells that make this chemical. This may be due to an autoimmune reaction. An autoimmune reaction is when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's healthy tissue.; Narcolepsy can run in families. Researchers have found certain genes linked to narcolepsy."
000803,Idiopathic hypersomnia,Hypersomnia - idiopathic; Drowsiness - idiopathic; Somnolence - idiopathic,"Symptoms often develop slowly during the teens or young adulthood. They include:; Other symptoms may include:; Daytime naps that do not relieve drowsiness; Difficulty waking from a long sleep -- may feel confused or disoriented (''sleep drunkenness''); Increased need for sleep during the day -- even while at work, or during a meal or conversation; Increased sleep time -- up to 14 to 18 hours a day; Anxiety; Feeling irritated; Loss of appetite; Low energy; Restlessness; Slow thinking or speech; Trouble remembering","IH is similar to narcolepsy in that you are extremely sleepy. It is different from narcolepsy because IH doesn't usually involve suddenly falling asleep (sleep attacks) or losing muscle control due to strong emotions (cataplexy). Also, unlike narcolepsy, naps in IH are usually not refreshing."
000804,Natural short sleeper,Sleep - natural short sleeper,Natural short sleepers are not overly tired or sleepy during the day.,"Although each person's need for sleep varies, the typical adult needs an average of 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. Short sleepers sleep less than 75% of what is normal for their age.; Natural short sleepers do not restrict the number of hours they sleep on purpose. Scientists believe that genetic variation allows natural short sleepers to function well with less sleep than normal.; Natural short sleepers are different from people who chronically do not get enough sleep because of work or family demands, or those who have medical or mental health conditions that disrupt sleep."

It usually occurs in people with a brain function problem who also don't have a regular routine during the day. The total sleep time is normal, but the body clock loses its normal circadian cycle.; People with changing work shifts and travelers who often change time zones may also have these symptoms. These people have a different condition, such as shift work sleep disorder or jet lag syndrome."
000807,Restless legs syndrome,Willis-Ekbom disease; Nocturnal myoclonus; RLS; Akathisia,"RLS leads to unpleasant feelings in your lower legs. These feelings cause an unstoppable urge to move your legs.

This condition is called periodic limb movement disorder.; All of these symptoms make it hard to sleep. Lack of sleep can lead to:; Creeping and crawling; Bubbling, pulling, or tugging; Burning or searing; Aching, throbbing, or pain; Itching or gnawing; Tingling, pins and needles in the feet; Are worse at night when you lie down to the point that it may interfere with sleep and keep you awake; Sometimes occur during the day; Start or get worse when you lie down or sit for long periods of time; May last for 1 hour or longer; Sometimes also occur in the upper legs, feet, or arms; Are relieved when you move or stretch as long as you keep moving; Daytime sleepiness; Anxiety or depression; Confusion; Difficulty thinking clearly","No one knows exactly what causes RLS. It may be due to a problem with the way brain cells use dopamine. Dopamine is a brain chemical that helps with muscle movement.; RLS may be linked to some other conditions. It may occur more often in people with:; RLS may also occur in people who:; RLS occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults. Women are more likely to have RLS than men.; RLS is commonly passed down in families.

But they may fall asleep in a different or even unusual place.; Symptoms of sleepwalking include:; Acting confused or disoriented when the person wakes up; Aggressive behavior when woken up by someone else; Having a blank look on the face; Opening eyes during sleep; Not remembering the sleep walking episode when they wake up; Performing detailed activity of any type during sleep; Sitting up and appearing awake during sleep; Talking during sleep and saying things that do not make sense; Walking during sleep","The normal sleep cycle has stages, from light drowsiness to deep sleep. During the stage called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming is most common.; Each night, people go through several cycles of non-REM and REM sleep. Sleepwalking (somnambulism) most often occurs during deep, non-REM sleep (called N3 sleep) early in the night.; Sleepwalking is much more common in children and young adults than in older adults. This is because as people age, they have less N3 sleep. Sleepwalking tends to run in families.; Fatigue, lack of sleep, and anxiety are all associated with sleepwalking. In adults, sleepwalking may occur due to:; In older adults, sleepwalking may be a symptom of a medical problem that causes decreased mental function neurocognitive disorder.; Alcohol, sedatives, or other medicines, such as some sleeping pills; Medical conditions, such as seizures; Mental disorders"
000809,Night terrors in children,Pavor nocturnus; Sleep terror disorder,"Night terrors are most common during the first third of the night, often between midnight and 2 a.m.; Children often scream and are very frightened and confused. They thrash around violently and are often not aware of their surroundings.; The child may not be able to respond to being talked to, comforted, or awakened.; The child may be sweating, breathing very fast (hyperventilating), have a fast heart rate, and widened (dilated) pupils.; The spell may last 10 to 20 minutes, then the child goes back to sleep.; Most children are unable to explain what happened the next morning. They often have no memory of the event when they wake up the next day.; Children with night terrors may also sleep walk.; In contrast, nightmares are more common in the early morning. They may occur after someone watches frightening movies or TV shows, or has an emotional experience. A person may remember the details of a dream after waking up and will not be disoriented after the episode.; Children often scream and are very frightened and confused. They thrash around violently and are often not aware of their surroundings.; The child may not be able to respond to being talked to, comforted, or awakened.; The child may be sweating, breathing very fast (hyperventilating), have a fast heart rate, and widened (dilated) pupils.; The spell may last 10 to 20 minutes, then the child goes back to sleep.","The cause is unknown, but night terrors may be triggered by:; Night terrors are most common in children ages 3 through 7, and much less common after that.

This includes the muscles that help keep your throat open so air can flow into your lungs.; Normally, your throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. Some people have a narrow throat. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.; Loud snoring is a telltale symptom of OSA. Snoring is caused by air squeezing through the narrowed or blocked airway. Not everyone who snores has OSA though.; Other factors also may increase your risk:; Sleeping on your back can also cause your airway to become blocked or narrowed.; Central sleep apnea is a different sleep disorder during which breathing also can stop. It occurs when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that control breathing.; A lower jaw that is short compared to your upper jaw; Certain shapes of the roof of your mouth (palate) or airway that cause it to collapse more easily; Large neck or collar size, 17 inches (43 centimeters) or more in men and 16 in (41 cm) or more in women; Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway; Obesity; Large tonsils and adenoids that can block the airway"
000812,Allergies,Allergy - allergies; Allergy - allergens,"Mostly, the part of the body the allergen touches determines what symptoms you develop. For example:; At times, an allergy can trigger a response that involves the entire body.; Allergens that you breathe in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus, cough, and wheezing.; Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes.; Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash, hives, itching, blisters, or skin peeling.; Medicine allergies and food allergies may involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms.","Allergies are very common. Both genes and environment play a role. If both your parents have allergies, there is a good chance that you could also have allergies.; The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. The immune system can also react to foreign substances called allergens. These allergens are usually harmless, and in most people do not cause a problem.; In a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.; Common allergens include:; Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers. Sometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.; Allergies may make certain medical conditions, such as sinus problems, eczema, and asthma, worse.; Drugs; Dust; Food; Insect venom; Mold; Pet and other animal dander; Pollen"
000813,Allergic rhinitis,Hay fever; Nasal allergies; Seasonal allergy; Seasonal allergic rhinitis;Â Allergies - allergic rhinitis; Allergy - allergic rhinitis,"Symptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include:; Symptoms that may develop later include:; Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area; Problems with smell; Runny nose; Sneezing; Watery eyes; Stuffy nose (nasal congestion); Coughing; Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell; Sore throat; Dark circles under the eyes; Puffiness under the eyes; Fatigue and irritability; Headache","An allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen such as pollen, mold, animal dander, or dust, the body releases chemicals that cause allergy symptoms.; Hay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen.; Plants that cause hay fever are trees, grasses, and ragweed. Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever. Types of plants that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from area to area.; The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not.; Hay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies.; Hot, dry, windy days are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air.; On cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground."
000815,Transplant rejection,Graft rejection; Tissue/organ rejection,"Symptoms may include:; The symptoms depend on the transplanted organ or tissue. For example, patients who reject a kidney may make less urine, and patients who reject a heart may have symptoms of heart failure.; The organ's function may start to decrease; General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling; Pain or swelling in the area of the organ (rare); Fever (rare); Flu-like symptoms, including chills, body aches, nausea, cough, and shortness of breath","Your body's immune system usually protects you from substances that may be harmful, such as germs, poisons, and sometimes, cancer cells.; These harmful substances have proteins called antigens coating their surfaces. As soon as these antigens enter the body, the immune system recognizes that they are not from that person's body and that they are ""foreign,"" and attacks them.; When a person receives an organ from someone else during transplant surgery, that person's immune system may recognize that it is foreign. This is because the person's immune system detects that the antigens on the cells of the organ are different or not ""matched."" Mismatched organs, or organs that are not matched closely enough, can trigger a blood transfusion reaction or transplant rejection.; To help prevent this reaction, doctors type, or match both the organ donor and the person who is receiving the organ. The more similar the antigens are between the donor and recipient, the less likely that the organ will be rejected.; Tissue typing ensures that the organ or tissue is as similar as possible to the tissues of the recipient. The match is usually not perfect. No two people, except identical twins, have identical tissue antigens.; Doctors use medicines to suppress the recipient's immune system. The goal is to prevent the immune system from attacking the newly transplanted organ. If these medicines are not used, the body will almost always launch an immune response and destroy the foreign tissue.; There are some exceptions, though. Cornea transplants are rarely rejected because the cornea has no blood supply. Also, transplants from one identical twin to another are almost never rejected.; There are three types of rejection:; Hyperacute rejection occurs a few minutes after the transplant when the antigens are completely unmatched. The tissue must be removed right away so the recipient does not die. This type of rejection is seen when a recipient is given the wrong type of blood. For example, when a person is given type A blood when he or she is type B.; Acute rejection may occur any time from the first week after the transplant to 3 months afterward. All recipients have some amount of acute rejection.; Chronic rejection can take place over many years. The body's constant immune response against the new organ slowly damages the transplanted tissues or organ."
000816,Autoimmune disorders,,"Symptoms will vary, based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include:; Fatigue; Fever; General ill feeling (malaise); Joint pain; Rash","The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.; When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and potentially harmful antigens. As a result, your body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues.; The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders.; An autoimmune disorder may result in:; An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include:; A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include:; The destruction of body tissue; Abnormal growth of an organ; Changes in organ function; Blood vessels; Connective tissues; Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas; Joints; Muscles; Red blood cells; Skin; Addison disease; Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy); Dermatomyositis; Graves disease; Hashimoto thyroiditis; Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis); Multiple sclerosis; Myasthenia gravis; Pernicious anemia; Reactive arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; SjÃ¶gren syndrome; Systemic lupus erythematosusÂ (lupus); Type I diabetes"
000817,Food allergy,Allergy to food; Food allergy - peanuts; Food allergy - soy; Food allergy - fish; Food allergy - shellfish; Food allergy - eggs; Food allergy - milk,"Symptoms usually begin within 2 hours after eating. Sometimes, the symptoms begin a longer time after eating the food.; Key symptoms of a food allergy include hives, a hoarse voice, and wheezing.; Other symptoms that may occur include:; Symptoms of mouth (oral) allergy syndrome:; In a severe reaction, called anaphylaxis, in addition to the above symptoms, you may have low blood pressure and blocked airways. This can be life threatening.; Swelling (angioedema), especially of the eyelids, face, lips, and tongue; Trouble swallowing or breathing due to swelling in the throat; Itching of the mouth, throat, eyes, skin, or any other area; Lightheadedness or fainting; Nasal congestion, runny nose; Stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting; Itchy lips, tongue, and throat; Swollen lips (sometimes)","Many people have a food intolerance. This term usually refers to heartburn, cramps, belly pain, or diarrhea that can occur after they eat foods such as:; A true food allergy is much less common.; The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens. These are usually harmless, and in most people, do not cause a problem.; In a person with a food allergy, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.; Any food can cause an allergic reaction. The most common food allergies are to:; In rare cases, food additives, such as dyes, thickeners, or preservatives can cause a food allergy or intolerance reaction.; Some people have an oral allergy. This is an allergy type syndrome that affects the mouth and tongue after they eat certain fresh fruits and vegetables:; Corn products; Cow's milk and dairy products (usually due toÂ lactose intolerance); Wheat and other grains that contain gluten (gluten intolerance orÂ celiac disease); Eggs (mostly in children); Fish (older children and adults); Milk (people of all ages); Peanuts (people of all ages); Shellfish such as shrimp, crab, and lobster (people of all ages); Soy (mostly in children); Tree nuts (people of all ages); Wheat (people of all ages); Melons, apples, pineapple, and other foods contain substances that are similar to certain pollens.; The reaction most often occurs when you eat the raw form of the foods. How severe the reaction is depends on how much of the food you eat.; Unlike true food allergies, people with the oral allergy syndrome rarely develop severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis."
000818,Immunodeficiency disorders,Immunosuppression; Immunodepressed - immunodeficiency; Immunosuppressed - immunodeficiency; Hypogammaglobulinemia - immunodeficiency; Agammaglobulinemia - immunodeficiency,"Your health care provider might think you have an immunodeficiency disorder if you have:; Other signs include:; Symptoms depend on the disorder. For example, those with decreased levels of IgA combined with low levels of certain IgG subclasses are likely to have problems involving the lungs, sinuses, ears, throat, and digestive tract.Â People with disorders of their T cells also may be more likely to develop severe fungal infections.; Infections that keep coming back or do not go away; Severe infection from bacteria or other germs that do not usually cause severe infection; Poor response to treatment for infections; Delayed or incomplete recovery from illness; Certain types of cancers (such as Kaposi sarcoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma); Certain infections (including some forms of pneumonia or repeated yeast infections)","The immune system is made up of lymphoid tissue in the body, which includes:; Proteins and cells in the blood are also part of the immune system.; The immune system helps protect the body from harmful substances called antigens. Examples of antigens include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and foreign blood or tissues from another person or species.; When the immune system detects an antigen, it responds by activating cells known as T lymphocytes, which interact with cells known as B lymphocytes. The B cells lead to production ofÂ proteins called antibodies that destroy the harmful substances. The immune system response also involves a process called phagocytosis. During this process, certain white blood cells swallow and destroy bacteria and other foreign substances. Proteins called complement help with this process.; Immunodeficiency disorders may affect any part of the immune system. Most often, these conditions occur when the T or B lymphocytes (or both) do not function normally or your body does not produce enough antibodies.; Inherited immunodeficiency disorders that affect B cells include:; Inherited immunodeficiency disorders that affect T cells may cause repeated Candida (yeast) infections. Inherited combined immunodeficiency affects both T cells and B cells. It may be deadly within the first year of life if it isn't treated early.; People are said to be immunosuppressed when they have an immunodeficiency disorder due to medicines that weaken the immune system. Examples include:; Acquired immunodeficiency may be a complication of diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malnutrition (especially if the person does not eat enough protein). Many cancers may also cause immunodeficiency.; People who have had their spleen removed have an acquired immunodeficiency, and are at higher risk for infection by certain bacteria that the spleen would normally help fight. People with diabetes are also at higher risk for certain infections.; As you get older, the immune system becomes less effective. Immune system tissues (especially lymphoid tissue such as the thymus) shrink, and the number and activity of white blood cells drop.; The following are diseases of the immune system that can prevent it from functioning normally:; Bone marrow; Lymph nodes; Parts of the spleen and gastrointestinal tract; Thymus; Tonsils; Hypogammaglobulinemia, which usually leads to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections; Agammaglobulinemia, which results in severe infections early in life, and is often deadly; CorticosteroidsÂ; Medicines used to treat health problems such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain skin conditions; Chemotherapy given to treat cancer; Ataxia-telangiectasia; Complement deficiencies; DiGeorge syndrome; Hypogammaglobulinemia; Job syndromeÂ or Hyper IgE syndrome; Leukocyte adhesion defects; Agammaglobulinemia; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; Comon variable immunodeficiency; Severe variable immunodeficiency"
000819,Drug allergies,Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity,"Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of reaction that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Drug allergies can also be associated with low blood counts.; Common symptoms of a drug allergy include:; Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:; Hives; Itching of the skin or eyes (common); Skin rash (common); Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face; Wheezing; Abdominal pain or cramping; Confusion; Diarrhea; Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice; Dizziness; Fainting, lightheadedness; Hives over different parts of the body; Nausea, vomiting; Rapid pulse; Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations)","A drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine.; The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. The reaction of the body when a drug allergy is present generally involves special cells called B and T cell lymphocytes.; Common allergy-causing drugs include:; Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction caused by the formation of IgE antibodies. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy.; Drugs used to treat seizures; Insulin (mainly insulin from animal sources); Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions); Penicillin and related antibiotics; Sulfa drugs"
000820,Serum sickness,Drug allergy - serum sickness; Allergic reaction - serum sickness; Allergy - serum sickness,"Unlike other medicine allergies, which occur very soon after receiving the medicine, serum sickness develops 7 to 21 days after the first exposure to a medicine. Some people develop symptoms in 1 to 3 days if they have already been exposed to the medicine.; Symptoms of serum sickness can include:; Fever; General ill feeling; Hives; Itching; Joint pain and swelling; Rash; Swollen lymph nodes","Plasma is the clear fluid portion of blood. It does not contain blood cells. But it does contain many proteins, including antibodies, which are formed as part of the immune response to protect against infection.; Antiserum is produced from the plasma of a person or animal that has immunity against an infection or poisonous substance. Antiserum may be used to protect a person who has been exposed to a germ or toxin. For example, you may receive a certain type of antiserum injection:; During serum sickness, the immune system falsely identifies a protein in antiserum as a harmful substance (antigen). The result is an immune system response that attacks the antiserum. Immune system elements and the antiserum combine to form immune complexes, which cause the symptoms of serum sickness.; Certain medicines (such as penicillin, cefaclor, and sulfa) can cause a similar reaction.; Injected proteins such as antithymocyte globulin (used to treat organ transplant rejection) and rituximab (used to treat immune disorders and cancers) can cause serum sickness reactions.; Blood products may also cause serum sickness.; If you have been exposed to tetanus or rabiesÂ and have never been vaccinated against these germs. This is called passive immunization.; If you have been bitten by a snake that produces a dangerous toxin."

Guttate psoriasis is usually seen in people younger than 30, especially in children. The condition often develops suddenly. It usually appears after an infection, most notably strep throat caused by group A streptococcus. Guttate psoriasis is not contagious. This means it can't spread to other people.; Psoriasis is a common disorder. The exact cause isn't known. But doctors think genes and the immune system are involved. Certain things can trigger an attack of symptoms.; With guttate psoriasis, in addition to strep throat, the following may trigger an attack:; Psoriasis may be severe in people who have a weakened immune system. This may include people who have:; Bacteria or viral infections, including upper respiratory infections; Injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, and insect bites; Some medicines, including those used to treat malaria and certain heart conditions; Stress; Sunburn; Too much alcohol; HIV/AIDS; Autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis; Chemotherapy for cancer"
000823,Folliculitis,Pseudofolliculitis barbae; Tinea barbae; Barber's itch,"Common symptoms include a rash, itching, and pimples or pustules near a hair follicle in the neck, groin, or genital area. The pimples may crust over.","Folliculitis starts when hair follicles are damaged or when the follicle is blocked. For example, this may occur from rubbing against clothing or shaving. Most of the time, the damaged follicles become infected with staphylococci (staph) bacteria.; Barber's itch is a staph infection of the hair follicles in the beard area, usually the upper lip. Shaving makes it worse. Tinea barbae is similar to barber's itch, but the infection is caused by a fungus.; Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a disorder that occurs mainly in African American men.

The bottom layer of the epidermis is the basal cell layer. With basal cancer, cells in this layer are the ones that become cancerous. Most basal cell cancers occur on skin that is regularly exposed to sunlight or other ultraviolet radiation.; This type of skin cancer is most common in people over age 50. But it can also occur in younger people who have had extensive sun exposure. Basal cell cancer is almost always slow-growing.

Fluid may drain out of the carbuncle, but sometimes the mass is so deep that it cannot drain on its own.; Carbuncles can develop anywhere. But they are most common on the back and the nape of the neck. Men get carbuncles more often than women.; The bacteria that cause this condition spread easily. So, family members may develop carbuncles at the same time. Often, the cause of a carbuncle cannot be determined.; You are more likely to get a carbuncle if you have:; People with diabetes, dermatitis, and a weakened immune system are more likely to develop staph infections that can cause carbuncles.; Staph bacteria are sometimes found in the nose or around the genitals. Carbuncles can recur when antibiotics are not able to treat the bacteria in those areas.; Friction from clothing or shaving; Poor hygiene; Poor overall health"
000826,Molluscum contagiosum,,"The infection on the skin begins as a small, painless papule, or bump. It may become raised to a pearly, flesh-colored nodule. The papule often has a dimple in the center. Scratching or other irritation causes the virus to spread in a line or in groups, called crops.; The papules are about 2 to 5 millimeters wide. Usually, there is no inflammation (swelling and redness) and no redness unless they have been irritated by rubbing or scratching.; In adults, the lesions are commonly seen on the genitals, abdomen, and inner thigh.","Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a virus that is a member of the poxvirus family. You can get the infection in different ways.; This is a common infection in children and occurs when a child comes into direct contact with a skin lesion or an object that has the virus on it.

This means the abnormal gene is needed from only one parent in order to inherit the disease.; Scientists have identified four genes involved in this condition. All of these genes appear to be important for blood vessels to develop properly. A mutation in any one of these genes is responsible for HHT.
000838,Body lice,Lice - body; Pediculosis corporis; Vagabond disease,"Lice cause severe itching. The itching is a reaction to the saliva from the insect's bite. Itching is usually worse around the waist, under the arms, and in places where clothing is tighter and closer to the body (such as near bra straps).; You may have red bumps on your skin. The bumps may scab or become crusty after scratching.; Skin around the waist or groin may become thickened or change color if you have been infected with lice in that area for a long time.","Body lice live in the seams and folds of clothing. They feed on human blood and lay their eggs and deposit waste matter on the skin and clothing.; Lice die within 3 days at room temperature if they fall off a person into most areas of the environment. However, they can live in the seams of clothing for up to 1 month.; You can get body lice if you come in direct contact with someone who has lice. You can also get lice from infected clothing, towels, or bedding.; Body lice are bigger than other types of lice.; You are more likely to get body lice if you do not bathe and wash your clothes often or live in close (overcrowded) conditions. Lice are unlikely to last if you:; Bathe regularly; Wash clothes and bedding at least once a week"
000839,Dermatomyositis,,"Symptoms may include:; The muscle weakness may come on suddenly or develop slowly over weeks or months.

Experts think it may be due to a viral infection of the muscles or a problem with the body's immune system. It may also occur in people who have cancer in the abdomen, lung, or other parts of the body.; Anyone can develop this condition. It most often occurs in children age 5 to 15 and adults age 40 to 60. It affects women more often than men."
000840,Head lice,Pediculosis capitis - head lice; Cooties - head lice,"Symptoms of head lice include:; Very bad itching of the scalp; Small, red bumps on the scalp, neck, and shoulders (bumps may become crusty and ooze); Tiny white specks (eggs, or nits) on the bottom of each hair that are hard to get off","Head lice infect hair on the head. Tiny eggs on the hair may look like flakes of dandruff. However, instead of flaking off the scalp, they stay in place.; Head lice can live up to 30 days on a human. Their eggs can live for more than 2 weeks.; Head lice spread easily, particularly among school children ages 3 to 11 years. Head lice are more common in close, overcrowded living conditions.; You can get head lice if:; Having head lice causes intense itching but does not lead to serious medical problems. Unlike body lice, head lice never carry or spread diseases.; Having head lice does not mean the person has poor hygiene or low social status.; You come in close contact with a person who has lice.; You touch the clothing or bedding of someone who has lice.; You share hats, towels, brushes, or combs of someone who has lice."
000841,Pubic lice,Pediculosis - pubic lice; Lice - pubic; Crabs; Pediculosis pubis; Phthirus pubis,"Pubic lice cause itching in the area covered by pubic hair. Itching often gets worse at night. The itching may start soon after getting infected with lice, or it may not start for up to 2 to 4 weeks after contact.; Other symptoms can include:; Local skin reactions to the bites that cause the skin to turn red or bluish-gray; Sores in the genital area due to bites and scratching","Pubic lice are most commonly spread during sexual activity.; Although not common, pubic lice can spread through contact with objects such as toilet seats, sheets, blankets, or bathing suits (that you may try on at a store).; Animals cannot spread public lice to humans.; Other types of lice include:; You are at greater risk for pubic lice if you:; Body lice; Head lice; Have many sexual partners (high incidence in men who have sex with men); Have sexual contact with an infected person; Share bedding or clothing with an infected person"
000842,Epidermoid cyst,Epidermal cyst; Keratin cyst; Epidermal inclusion cyst; Follicular infundibular cyst,"The main symptom is usually a small, non-painful lump beneath the skin. The lump is usually found on the face, neck, and trunk. It will often have a tiny hole or pit in the center. It usually grows slowly and is not painful.; If the lump becomes infected or inflamed, other symptoms may include:; Skin redness; Tender or sore skin; Warm skin in the affected area; Grayish-white, cheesy, foul-smelling material that drains from the cyst","Epidermoid cysts are very common. Their cause is unknown. The cysts are formed when elements of the surface skin get under the skin surface. The cyst then becomes filled with dead skin because as the skin grows, it can't be shed as it can elsewhere on the body. When a cyst reaches a certain size, it usually stops growing.; People with these cysts may have family members who also have them.; These cysts are more common in adults than in children.; Sometimes, epidermoid cysts are called sebaceous cysts. This is not correct because the contents of the two types of cysts are different. Epidermoid cysts are filled with dead skin cells, while true sebaceous cysts are filled with yellowish oily material. (A true sebaceous cyst is called a steatocystoma.)"
000843,Lamellar ichthyosis,LI; Collodion baby - lamellar ichthyosis; Ichthyosis congenital; Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis - lamellar ichthyosis type,"Many babies with LI are born with a clear, shiny, waxy layer of skin called a collodion membrane. For this reason, these babies are known as collodion babies. The membrane sheds within the first 2 weeks of life. The skin underneath the membrane is red and scaly resembling the surface of a fish.; With LI, the outer layer of skin called the epidermis cannot protect the body like the healthy epidermis can. As a result, a baby with LI may have the following health problems:; Older children and adults with LI may have these symptoms:; Difficulty in feeding; Loss of fluid (dehydration); Loss of balance of minerals in the body (electrolyte imbalance); Breathing problems; Body temperature that is not stable; Skin or body-wide infections; Giant scales that cover most of the body; Decreased ability to sweat, causing sensitivity to heat; Hair loss; Abnormal finger and toenails; Skin of the palms and solesÂ is thickened",LI isÂ anÂ autosomal recessive disease. This means that the mother and father must both pass one abnormal copy of the disease gene to their child in order for the child to develop the disease.

An allergen is a substance that, for most people, is harmless, but in some people, it can cause an allergic reaction.; After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again, an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis usually happens quickly after the exposure. The condition is severe and involves the whole body.; Tissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms.; Some medicines (morphine, x-ray dye, aspirin, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (often called an anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis. But, the symptoms, risk of complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions.; Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include:; Pollen and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause.; Anaphylaxis is life threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction.; Medicine allergies; Food allergies; Insect bites/stings"

It is unusual for a wheal to last more than 48 hours.; Dermatographism, or skin writing, is a type of hives. It is caused by pressure on the skin and results in immediate hives in the area that has been pressed on or scratched.","When you have an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into the blood. This causes itching, swelling, and other symptoms. Hives are a common reaction. People with other allergies, such as hay fever, often get hives.; Angioedema is swelling of the deeper tissue that sometimes occurs with hives. Like hives, angioedema can occur on any part of the body. When it occurs around the mouth or throat, the symptoms can be severe, including airway blockage.; Many substances can trigger hives, including:; Hives may also develop as a result of:; Often, the cause of hives is not known.; Animal dander (especially cats); Insect bites; Medicines; Pollen; Shellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, milk, and other foods; Emotional stress; Extreme cold or sun exposure; Excessive perspiration; Illness, including lupus, other autoimmune diseases, and leukemia; Infections such as mononucleosis; Exercise; Exposure to water"

Welts or swelling on the surface of the skin can also develop.; The swelling usually occurs around the eyes and lips. It may also be found on the hands, feet, and throat. The swelling may form a line or be more spread out.; The welts are painful and may be itchy. This is known as hives (urticaria). They turn pale and swell if irritated. The deeper swelling of angioedema may also be painful.; Other symptoms may include:; Abdominal cramping; Breathing difficulty; Swollen eyes and mouth; Swollen lining of the eyes (chemosis)","Angioedema may be caused by an allergic reaction. Angioedema typically is not itchy while hives are very itchy. During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream. The body releases histamine when the immune system detects a foreign substance called an allergen.; However, in most cases, the cause of angioedema is never found.; The following may cause angioedema:; Hives and angioedema may also occur after infections. Angioedema may occur alone or with other illnesses (including autoimmune disorders such as lupus,Â leukemia, and lymphoma).; A rare form of angioedema runs in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called hereditary angioedema.; Allergies due to animal dander (scales of shed skin), foods, insect bites or pollen; Exposure to water, sunlight, cold or heat; Medicines (drug allergy) such as antibiotics (penicillin and sulfa drugs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors); Autoimmune diseases such as lupus"
000847,Neurofibromatosis-1,NF1; Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis,"NF1 causes tissue along the nerves to grow uncontrollably. This growth can put pressure on affected nerves.; If the growths are in the skin, there can be cosmetic issues. If the growths are in other nerves or parts of the body, they can cause pain, severe nerve damage, and loss of function in the area the nerve affects. Problems with feeling or movement can occur, depending on which nerves are affected.; The condition can be very different from person to person, even among people in the same family who have the same NF1 gene change.; ""Coffee-with-milk"" (cafÃ© au lait) spots are the hallmark symptom of NF1. Many healthy people have one or two small cafÃ© au lait spots. However, adults who have six or more spots that are bigger than 1.5 cm in diameter (0.5 cm in children) could have NF1. In some people with the condition, these spots may be the only symptom.; Other symptoms may include:; Tumors of the eye, such as optic glioma; Seizures; Freckles in the underarm or groin; Large, soft tumors called plexiform neurofibromas, which may have a dark color and may spread under the surface of the skin; Pain (from affected nerves); Small, rubbery tumors of the skin called nodular neurofibromas","NF1 is a genetic disease. If either parent has NF1, each of their children has a 50% chance of having the disease.; NF1 also appears in families with no history of the condition. In these cases, it is caused by a new gene change (variant or mutation) in the sperm or egg. NF1 is caused by problems with a gene for a protein called neurofibromin."
000848,Cutaneous skin tag,Skin tag; Acrochordon; Fibroepithelial polyp,"The tag sticks out of the skin and may have a short, narrow stalk connecting it to the surface of the skin. Some skin tags are as long as a half an inch (1 centimeter). Most skin tags are the same color as skin, or a little darker.; In most cases, a skin tag is painless and does not grow or change. However, it may become irritated from rubbing by clothing or other materials.; Places where skin tags occur include:; Neck; Underarms; Middle of the body, or under folds of skin; Eyelids; Inner thighs; Other body areas",A cutaneous tag most often occurs in older adults. They are more common in people who are overweight or who have diabetes. They are thought to occur from skin rubbing against skin.

A sore or growth that bleeds, or changes in color can also be a sign of skin cancer.; The ABCDE system can help you remember possible symptoms of melanoma:; Another way to look for possible melanoma is the ""ugly duckling sign."" This means the melanoma does not look like any of the other spots on the body. It stands out like the ugly duckling in the children's story.; Asymmetry: One half of the abnormal area is different from the other half.; Borders: The edges of the growth are irregular.; Color: Color changes from one area to another, with shades of tan, brown, or black, and sometimes white, red, or blue. A mixture of colors may appear within one sore.; Diameter: The spot is usually (but not always) larger than 5 mm in diameter -- about the size of a pencil eraser.; Evolution: The mole keeps changing appearance.","Melanoma is caused by changes (mutations) in skin cells called melanocytes. These cells make a skin color pigment called melanin. Melanin is responsible for skin and hair color.; Melanoma can appear on normal skin. Sometimes it can develop from moles. Moles that are present at birth may develop into melanomas. Larger moles that are present at birth may be at higher risk for developing melanoma.; There are four major types of melanoma:; The risk for developing melanoma increases with age. However, more and more young people are developing it.; You are more likely to develop melanoma if you:; Other risk factors include:; Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type. It is usually flat and irregular in shape and color, with different shades of black and brown.

This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.; Syphilis occurs worldwide, most commonly in urban areas. The number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men (MSM). Young adults ages 20 to 35 are the highest-risk population. Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage.

Certain medicines, smoking, tampons, and condoms may also cause or worsen vaginal dryness.; Medicines or hormones used in the treatment of breast cancer, endometriosis, fibroids, or infertility; Surgery to remove the ovaries; Radiation treatment to the pelvic area; Chemotherapy; Severe stress, depression; Smoking"
000893,Cervical cancer,Cancer - cervix; Cervical cancer - HPV; Cervical cancer - dysplasia,"Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include:; Cervical cancer may spread to the vagina, lymph nodes, bladder, intestines, lungs, bones, and liver. Often, there are no problems or symptoms until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include:; Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause; Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling; Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual; Abdominal pain; Back pain; Bone pain or fractures; Fatigue; Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina; Leg pain; Loss of appetite; Pelvic pain; Single swollen leg; Weight loss","Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the widespread use of Pap testsÂ to screen for cervical cancer and conditions that may become cervical cancer.; Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar (gland cells). Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.; Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap test and is nearly 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap tests, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap test results.; Almost all cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is spread through skin-to-skin contact and also by sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical as well as other cancers. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.; A woman's sexual behavior can increase her risk for developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include:; Other risk factors for cervical cancer include:; Having sex at an early age; Having multiple sexual partners; Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities; Not getting the HPV vaccine; Being economically disadvantaged; Having a mother who took the medicine diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage; Having a weakened immune system"

Symptoms of surgical menopause can be more severe and start more suddenly.; The first thing you may notice is that periods start to change. They might occur more often or less often. Some women might get their period every 3 weeks before starting to skip periods You may have irregular periods for 1 to 3 years before they stop completely.; Common symptoms of menopause include:; Other symptoms of menopause may include:; Menstrual periods that occur less often and eventually stop; Heart pounding or racing; Hot flashes, usually worst during the first 1 to 2 years; Night sweats; Skin flushing; Sleeping problems (insomnia); Decreased interest in sex or changes in sexual response; Forgetfulness (in some women); Headaches; Mood swings, including irritability, depression, and anxiety; Urine leakage; Vaginal dryness and painful sexual intercourse; Vaginal infections; Joint aches and pains; Irregular heartbeat (palpitations)","During menopause, a woman's ovaries stop releasing eggs. Her body produces less of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Lower levels of these hormones cause menopause symptoms.; Periods occur less often and eventually stop. Sometimes this happens suddenly. But most of the time, periods slowly stop over time.; Menopause is complete when you have not had a period for 1 year. This is called postmenopause. Surgical menopause takes place when surgical treatments cause a drop in estrogen. This can happen if both of your ovaries are removed.; Menopause can also sometimes be caused by drugs used for chemotherapy or hormone therapy (HT) for breast cancer."
000895,Ectopic pregnancy,Tubal pregnancy; Cervical pregnancy; Tubal ligation - ectopic pregnancy,"Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy may include:; If the area around the abnormal pregnancy ruptures and bleeds, symptoms may get worse. They may include:; Abnormal vaginal bleeding; Mild cramping on one side of the pelvis; No periods; Pain in the lower belly or pelvic area; Fainting or feeling faint; Intense pressure in the rectum; Low blood pressure; Pain in the shoulder area; Severe, sharp, and sudden pain in the lower abdomen","In most pregnancies, the fertilized egg travels through the fallopian tube to the womb (uterus). If the movement of the egg is blocked or slowed through the tubes, it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Things that may cause this problem include:; The following also increase risk for an ectopic pregnancy:; Sometimes, the cause is not known. Hormones may play a role.; The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube. In rare cases, this can occur in the ovary, abdomen, or cervix.; An ectopic pregnancy can occur even if you use birth control.; Birth defect in the fallopian tubes; Scarring after a ruptured appendix; Endometriosis; Having had an ectopic pregnancy in the past; Scarring from past infections or surgery of the female organs; History of prior abdominal surgery; Age over 35; Getting pregnant while having an intrauterine device (IUD); Having your fallopian tubes tied; Having had surgery to untie fallopian tubes to become pregnant; Having had many sexual partners; Sexually transmitted infections (STI); Some infertility treatments"
000896,Gestational diabetes,Glucose intolerance during pregnancy,"Most of the time, there are no symptoms.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs when more unhealthy bacteria than healthy bacteria grow. BV may cause a thin, gray vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, and a fishy odor.; A less common type of vaginitis is spread by sexual contact. It is called trichomoniasis. Symptoms in women include genital itching, vaginal odor, and a heavy vaginal discharge that may be yellow-gray or green in color. Women may also experience vaginal spotting after intercourse.; OTHER CAUSES; Chemicals can cause itchy rashes in the genital area.; Low estrogen levels in women after menopause can cause vaginal dryness and thinning of the skin of the vagina and vulva. These factors may lead to or worsen genital itching and burning. This condition is called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), formerly known as atrophic vaginitis.; Other causes include:; Sometimes, the exact cause cannot be found. This is called nonspecific vulvovaginitis.; Irritated tissue is more likely to become infected than healthy tissue. Many germs that cause infection thrive in a warm, damp, and dark environment. This can also lead to a longer recovery.; Sexual abuse should be considered in young girls with unusual infections and repeated episodes of unexplained vulvovaginitis.; Yeast infections are most often due to the fungus Candida albicans.; Candida and the many other germs that normally live in the vagina keep each other in balance. However, sometimes the number of candida organisms increase. This leads to a yeast infection.; Yeast infections often cause genital itching, a thick white vaginal discharge, rash, and other symptoms.; Spermicides and vaginal sponges, which are over-the-counter birth control methods; Feminine sprays and perfumes; Bubble baths and soaps; Body lotions; Tight-fitting or nonabsorbent clothing, which leads to heat rashes.; Skin conditions.; Objects such as a lost tampon in your vagina can also cause irritation, itching, and strong-smelling discharge.; It occurs in all age groups. However, it is most common in young girls before puberty, particularly girls with poor genital hygiene.; It causes a foul-smelling, brownish-green discharge and irritation of the labia and vaginal opening.; This condition is often linked with excess growth of bacteria that are typically found in the stool. These bacteria are sometimes spread from the rectum to the vaginal area by wiping from back to front after using the toilet."

Pain may also be felt in the right shoulder, and can be confused with heartburn, gallbladder pain, a stomach virus, or kicking by the baby.; Urinating less often than usual.; Nausea and vomiting (a worrisome sign).; Vision changes, including temporary blindness, seeing flashing lights or spots, sensitivity to light, and blurry vision.; Feeling lightheaded or faint.","The exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown. It occurs in 3% to 7% of all pregnancies. The condition is thought to start in the placenta. Factors that may lead to preeclampsia developing include:; Risk factors for the condition include:; Autoimmune disordersÂ such as lupus; Blood vessel problems; Your diet; Your genes; First pregnancy; Past history of preeclampsia; Past history of a growth-impaired baby; Multiple pregnancy (twins or more); Family history of preeclampsia; Obesity; Being older than age 35; Being African American; Being pregnant more than 10 years after a previous pregnancy; History of diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease; History of thyroid disease; IVF pregnancy, especially after a frozen embryo transfer"
000899,Eclampsia,Pregnancy - eclampsia; Preeclampsia - eclampsia; High blood pressure - eclampsia; Seizure - eclampsia; Hypertension - eclampsia,"Symptoms of eclampsia include:; Most women will have these symptoms of preeclampsia before the seizure:; Seizures; Severe agitation; Unconsciousness; Altered mental status and confusion; Headaches; Nausea and vomiting; Stomach pain; Swelling of the hands and face; Vision problems, such as loss of vision, blurred vision, double vision, or missing areas in the visual field","The exact cause of eclampsia is not known. Factors that may play a role include:; Eclampsia follows a condition called preeclampsia. This is a complication of pregnancy in which a woman has high blood pressure and other findings.; Most women with preeclampsia do not go on to have eclampsia (seizures).

000900,Placenta previa,Vaginal bleeding - placenta previa; Pregnancy - placenta previa,"The main symptom of placenta previa is sudden bleeding from the vagina. Some women also have cramps. The bleeding often starts near the end of the second trimester or beginning of the third trimester.; Bleeding may be severe and life threatening. It may stop on its own but can start again days or weeks later.; Labor sometimes starts within several days of the heavy bleeding. Sometimes, bleeding may not occur until after labor starts.","During pregnancy, the placenta moves as the womb stretches and grows. It is very common for the placenta to be low in the womb in early pregnancy. But as the pregnancy continues, the placenta moves to the top of the womb. By the third trimester, the placenta should be near the top of the womb, so the cervix is open for delivery.; Sometimes, the placenta partly or completely covers the cervix. This is called a placenta previa.; There are different forms of placenta previa:; Placenta previa occurs in 1 out of 200 pregnancies. It is more common in women who have:; Women who smoke, use cocaine, or have their children at an older age may also have an increased risk.; Marginal: The placenta is next to the cervix but does not cover the opening.; Partial: The placenta covers part of the cervical opening.; Complete: The placenta covers all of the cervical opening.; An abnormally shaped uterus; Had many pregnancies in the past; Had multiple pregnancies, such as twins or triplets; Scarring on the lining of the uterus due to a history of surgery, C-section, or abortion; In vitro fertilization; A history of placenta previa in a previous pregnancy"

The hormones estrogen and progesterone are released as part of the process of ovulation. When a woman ovulates, an egg is released.; AUB can occur when the ovaries do not release an egg. Changes in hormone levels cause your period to be later or earlier. Your period may sometimes be heavier than normal.; AUB is more common in teenagers or in premenopausal women. Women who are overweight also may be more likely to have AUB.; In many women, AUB is caused by a hormone imbalance. It can also occur due to following causes:; On average, a woman's period (menstrual flow) occurs every 28 days, although cycles may vary from 24 to 34 days.; Menstruation flow normally last about 4 to 7 days.; Young girls may get their periods anywhere from 21 to 45 days or more apart.; Women in their 40s may start to have their period less often or have the interval between their periods decrease.; Thickening of the uterine wall or lining; Uterine fibroids; Uterine polyps; Cancers of ovaries, uterus, cervix, or vagina; Bleeding disorders or problems with blood clotting; Polycystic ovary syndrome; Severe weight loss; Hormonal birth control, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUD); Excessive weight gain or loss (more than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms); Infection of the uterus or cervix"

Tissue or clot-like material may pass from the vagina.; Vaginal bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy (last menstrual period was less than 20 weeks ago). Vaginal bleeding occurs in almost all threatened miscarriages.; Abdominal cramps may also occur. If abdominal cramps occur in the absence of significant bleeding, consult your health care provider to check for other problems besides threatened miscarriage.","Some pregnant women have some vaginal bleedingÂ during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Bleeding may occurÂ with or without abdominal cramps. When the symptoms indicate a miscarriage is possible, the condition is called a ""threatened abortion."" (This refers to a natural event that is not due to a medical or surgical abortion.); Miscarriage is common. Small falls, injuries or stress during the first trimester of pregnancy can cause threatened miscarriage. It occurs in almost one half of all pregnancies. The chance of miscarriage is higher in older women. About one half of women who have bleeding in the first trimester will have a miscarriage."

It results in an abnormal fetus. The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound, this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts.; The chance of mole formation is higher in older women. A history of mole in earlier years is also a risk factor.; Molar pregnancy can be of two types:; There is no way to prevent formation of these masses.; Partial molar pregnancy: There is an abnormal placenta and some fetal development.; Complete molar pregnancy: There is an abnormal placenta and no fetus."
000910,Endometrial cancer,Endometrial adenocarcinoma; Uterine adenocarcinoma; Uterine cancer; Adenocarcinoma - endometrium; Adenocarcinoma - uterus; Cancer - uterine; Cancer - endometrial; Uterine corpus cancer,"Symptoms of endometrial cancer include:; Abnormal bleeding from the vagina, including bleeding between periods or spotting/bleeding after menopause; Extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of vaginal bleeding after age 40; Lower abdominal pain or pelvic cramping","Endometrial cancer is the most common type of uterine cancer. The exact cause of endometrial cancer is not known. An increased level of estrogen hormone may play a role. This stimulates the buildup of the lining of the uterus. This can lead to abnormal overgrowth of the endometrium and cancer.; Most cases of endometrial cancer occur between the ages of 60 and 70. A few cases may occur before age 40.; The following factors related to your hormones increase your risk for endometrial cancer:; Women with the following conditions also seem to be at a higher risk for endometrial cancer:; Estrogen replacement therapy without the use of progesterone; History of endometrial polyps; Infrequent periods; Never being pregnant; Obesity; Diabetes; Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); Starting menstruation at an early age (before age 12); Starting menopause after age 50; Tamoxifen, a drug used for breast cancer treatment; Colon or breast cancer; Gallbladder disease; High blood pressure"

But it poses extra risks to the unborn baby. When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it easily passes across the placenta to the fetus. Because of this, drinking alcohol can harm the unborn baby.; There is no ""safe"" level of alcohol use during pregnancy. Larger amounts of alcohol appear to increase the problems. Binge drinking is more harmful than drinking small amounts of alcohol.; Timing of alcohol use during pregnancy is also important. Drinking alcohol is likely most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy. But drinking alcohol any time during pregnancy can be harmful."

They tend to get better after your period starts.; If you have heavy, irregular periods, your symptoms may be worse. If you take birth control pills, you may have fewer symptoms. In most cases, symptoms get better after menopause.; Symptoms may include:; You may have a lump in the same area of the breast that becomes larger before each period and returns to its original size afterward. This type of lump moves when it is pushed with your fingers. It does not feel stuck or fixed to the tissue around it. This type of lump is common with fibrocystic breasts.; Pain or discomfort in both breasts that may come and go with your period, but may last through the whole month; Breasts that feel full, swollen, or heavy; Pain or discomfort under the arms; Breast lumps that change in size with the menstrual period","Fibrocystic breast changes
occur when thickening of breast tissue (fibrosis) and fluid-filled cysts
develop in one or both breasts. It is thought that hormones made in the ovaries
during menstruation can trigger these breast changes. This may make your
breasts feel swollen, lumpy, or painful before or during your period each
month.; More than half of women
have this condition at some time during their life. It is most common between
the ages of 30 and 50. It is rare in women after menopause unless they are
taking estrogen. Fibrocystic breast changes do not change your risk for breast
cancer."

This is why regular breast cancer screening is important, so cancers that don't have symptoms may be found earlier.; As the cancer grows, symptoms may include:; In men, breast cancer symptoms include breast lump, breast pain, and breast tenderness.; Symptoms of advanced breast cancer may include:; Breast lump or lump in the armpit that is hard, has uneven edges, and usually does not hurt.; Change in the size, shape, or feel of the breast or nipple. For example, you may have redness, dimpling, or puckering that looks like the skin of an orange.; Fluid from the nipple. Fluid may be bloody, clear to yellow, green, or look like pus.; Bone pain; Shortness of breath; Swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpit (next to the breast with cancer); Weight loss","Breast cancer risk factors are things that increase the chance that you could develop breast cancer:; Some women are at higher risk for breast cancer because of certain genetic changes or variants that may be passed down from their parents.; Breast implants, using antiperspirants, and wearing underwire bras do not increase the risk for breast cancer. There is also no evidence of a direct link between breast cancer and pesticides.; Some risk factors you can control, such as drinking alcohol. Others, such as family history, you cannot control.; The more risk factors you have, the more your risk increases. But, it does not mean you will develop cancer. Most women who develop breast cancer do not have known risk factors or a family history.; Understanding your risk factors can help you take steps to lower your risk.; Genes known as BRCA1 or BRCA2 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast cancers.; A screening tool with questions about your and your family's medical history can help your health care provider determine whether you are at risk for carrying these genes.; If you may be at high risk due to a known variant gene such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, a blood test can show if you carry the genes.; Certain other genes may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer."

They are thought to be caused by:; Fibroids can be so tiny that you need a microscope to see them. They can also grow very large. They may fill the entire uterus and may weigh several pounds or kilograms. Although it is possible for just one fibroid to develop, most often there is more than one.; Fibroids can grow:; Hormones in the body; Genes (may run in families); In the muscle wall of the uterus (myometrial); Just under the surface of the uterine lining (submucosal); Just under the outside lining of the uterus (subserosal); On a long stalk on the outside of the uterus or inside the uterus (pedunculated)"

Your uterus sheds these cells along with blood and tissue through your vagina when you have your period.; Endometriosis occurs when these cells grow outside the uterus in other parts of your body. This tissue may attach on your:; It can grow in other areas of the body, too.; These growths stay in your body, and like the cells in the lining of your uterus, these growths react to the hormones from your ovaries. This may cause you to have pain during the month prior to the onset of your period. Over time, the growths may add more tissue and blood. Growths can also build up in the abdomen and pelvis, leading to chronic pelvic pain, heavy cycles, and infertility.; The cause of endometriosis is unknown. One idea is that when you get your period, the cells may travel backwards through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis. Once there, the cells attach and grow. However, this backward period flow occurs in many women. The immune system may play a role in causing endometriosis in women with the condition.; Endometriosis is common. It occurs in about 10% of women of reproductive age. Sometimes, it may run in families. Endometriosis probably starts when a woman begins having periods. However, it usually is not diagnosed until ages 25 to 35.; You are more likely to develop endometriosis if you:; Ovaries; Fallopian tubes; Bowel; Rectum; Bladder; Lining of your pelvic area; Have a mother or sister with endometriosis; Started your period at a young age; Never had children; Have frequent periods, or they last 7 or more days"

The problem occurs less in full-term infants.; Some babies have a condition called retractile testes and the health care provider may not be able to find the testicles. In this case, the testicle is normal, but is pulled back out of the scrotum by a muscle reflex. This occurs because the testicles are still small before puberty. The testicles will descend normally at puberty and surgery is not needed.; Testicles that do not naturally descend into the scrotum are considered abnormal. An undescended testicle is more likely to develop cancer, even if it is brought into the scrotum with surgery. Cancer is also more likely in the other testicle.; Bringing the testicle into the scrotum can improve sperm production and increase the chances of good fertility. It also allows the provider to do an exam for the early detection of cancer.; In other cases, no testicle may be found, even during surgery. This may be due to a problem that occurred while the baby was still developing before birth."

The fever often does not come down with normal doses of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen.; Other symptoms often include:; Additional symptoms may include:; Bloodshot or red eyes (without pus or drainage); Bright red, chapped, or cracked lips; Red mucous membranes in the mouth; ""Strawberry"" tongue, with white coating on the tongue, or visible red bumps on the back of the tongue; Red, swollen palms of the hands and the soles of the feet; Skin rashes on the middle of the body, not blister-like; Peeling skin in the genital area, hands, and feet (mostly around the nails, palms, and soles); Swollen lymph nodes in the neck (often only one lymph node is swollen); Joint pain and swelling, often on both sides of the body; Irritability; Diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; Cough and runny nose","Kawasaki disease occurs most often in Japan, where it was first discovered. The disease is seen more often in boys than in girls. Most of the children who develop this condition are younger than age 5.; Kawasaki disease is not well understood and the cause is yet unknown. It may be an autoimmune disorder. The problem affects the mucous membranes, lymph nodes, walls of the blood vessels, and the heart."
000990,Asthma in children,Pediatric asthma; Asthma - pediatric; Wheezing - asthma - children,"Breathing problems are common. They can include:; When your child is having a hard time breathing, the skin of the chest and neck may suck inward.; Other symptoms of asthma in children include:; Your child's asthma symptoms may vary. Symptoms may appear often or develop only when triggers are present. Some children are more likely to have asthma symptoms at night.; Shortness of breath; Feeling out of breath; Gasping for air; Trouble breathing out (exhaling); Breathing faster than normal; Coughing that sometimes wakes the child up at night (it may be the only symptom).; Dark bags under the eyes.; Feeling tired.; Irritability.; Tightness in the chest.; A whistling sound made when breathing (wheezing). You may notice it more when your child breathes out.","Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. During an asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways tighten. The lining of the air passages swells. As a result, less air is able to pass through.; Asthma is often seen in children. It is a leading cause of missed school days and hospital visits for children. An allergic reaction is a key part of asthma in children. Asthma and allergies often occur together.; In children who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens, or triggers.; Common asthma triggers include:; Animals (hair or dander); Dust, mold, and pollen; Aspirin and other medicines; Changes in weather (most often cold weather); Chemicals in the air or in food; Tobacco smoke; Exercise; Strong emotions; Viral infections, such as the common cold"
000991,Failure to thrive,Growth failure; FTT; Feeding disorder; Poor feeding,"Children who fail to thrive do not grow and develop normally as compared to children of the same age. They seem to be much smaller or shorter. Teenagers may not have the usual changes that occur at puberty.; Symptoms of failure to thrive include:; The following may be delayed or slow to develop in children who fail to thrive:; Babies who fail to gain weight or develop often lack interest in feeding or have a problem receiving the proper amount of nutrition. This is called poor feeding.; Other symptoms that may be seen in a child that fails to thrive include:; Height, weight, and head circumference do not match standard growth charts; Weight is lower than third percentile of standard growth charts or 20% below the ideal weight for their height; Growth may have slowed or stopped; Physical skills, such as rolling over, sitting, standing and walking; Mental and social skills; Secondary sexual characteristics (delayed in adolescents); Constipation; Excessive crying; Excessive sleepiness (lethargy); Irritability","Failure to thrive may be caused by medical problems or factors in the child's environment, such as abuse or neglect.; There are many medical causes of failure to thrive. These include:; Factors in the child's environment include:; Many times, the cause cannot be determined.; Problems with genes, such as Down syndrome; Organ problems; Hormone problems; Damage to the brain or central nervous system, which may cause feeding difficulties in an infant; Heart or lung problems, which can affect how nutrients move through the body; Anemia or other blood disorders; Gastrointestinal problems that make it hard to absorb nutrients or cause a lack of digestive enzymes; Long-term (chronic) infections; Metabolism problems; Problems during pregnancy or low birth weight; Loss of emotional bond between parent and child; Poverty; Problems with child-caregiver relationship; Parents do not understand the appropriate diet needs for their child; Exposure to infections, parasites, or toxins; Poor eating habits, such as eating in front of the television and not having formal meal times"
000992,Gastroschisis,Birth defect - gastroschisis; Abdominal wall defect - infant; Abdominal wall defect - neonate; Abdominal wall defect - newborn,"A gastroschisis is usually seen during a prenatal ultrasound. It can also be seen when the baby is born. There is a hole in the abdominal wall. The small intestine is often outside the abdomen near the umbilical cord. Other organs that may also be outside the abdomen are the large intestine, stomach, and/or gallbladder.; Usually the intestine is irritated by the exposure to amniotic fluid. The baby may have problems absorbing food.","Babies with gastroschisis are born with a hole in the abdominal wall. The child's intestines often stick out (protrude) through the hole.; The condition looks similar to an omphalocele. An omphalocele, however, is a birth defect in which the infant's intestine or other abdominal organs protrude through a hole in the belly button area and are covered with a membrane. With gastroschisis, there is no covering membrane.; Abdominal wall defects develop as a baby grows inside the mother's womb. During development, the intestine and other organs (liver, bladder, stomach, and ovaries, or testes) develop outside the body at first and then usually return inside. In babies with gastroschisis, the intestines (and sometimes the stomach) remain outside the abdominal wall, without a membrane covering them. The exact cause of abdominal wall defects is not known.; Mothers with the following may be at higher risk of having babies with gastroschisis:; Babies with gastroschisis usually do not have other related birth defects.; Younger age; Fewer resources; Poor nutrition during pregnancy; Use of tobacco, illicit drugs, and alcohol; Exposure to nitrosamine (a chemical found in some foods, cosmetics, cigarettes); Use of aspirin or ibuprofen; Use of decongestants that have the chemical pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine"

It is usually seen in children younger than 10 years and in adults around 50 years of age. Men are more affected than women.; Diskitis can be caused by an infection from bacteria or a virus. It can also be caused by inflammation, such as from autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which the immune system mistakenly attacks certain cells in the body.; Disks in the neck and low back are most commonly affected."
000994,Omphalocele,Birth defect - omphalocele; Abdominal wall defect - infant; Abdominal wall defect - neonate; Abdominal wall defect - newborn,"An omphalocele can be clearly seen. This is because the abdominal contents stick out through the belly button area.; There are different sizes of omphaloceles. In small ones, only the intestines remain outside the body. In larger ones, the liver or other organs may be outside as well.","An omphalocele is considered an abdominal wall defect (a hole in the abdominal wall). The child's intestines usually stick out (protrude) through the hole.; The condition looks similar to gastroschisis. An omphalocele is a birth defect in which the infant's intestine or other abdominal organs protrude through a hole in the belly button area and are covered with a membrane. In gastroschisis, there is no covering membrane.; Abdominal wall defects develop as a baby grows inside the mother's womb. During development, the intestines and other organs (liver, bladder, stomach, and ovaries or testes) develop outside the body at first and then usually return inside. In babies with omphalocele, the intestines and other organs remain outside the abdominal wall, with a membrane covering them. The exact cause for abdominal wall defects is not known.; Infants with an omphalocele often have other birth defects. Defects include genetic problems (chromosomal abnormalities), congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and heart and kidney defects. These problems also affect the overall outlook (prognosis) for the baby's health and survival."
000995,Jaundice and breastfeeding,Hyperbilirubinemia - breast milk; Breast milk jaundice; Breastfeeding failure jaundice,"Your child's skin, and possibly the whites of the eyes (sclerae), will look yellow.","Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced as the body recycles old red blood cells. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool.; It can be normal for newborn babies to be a little yellow between days 1 and 5 of life. The color most often peaks around day 3 or 4.; Breast milk jaundice is seen after the first week of life. It is likely caused by:; Sometimes, jaundice occurs when your baby does not get enough breast milk, instead of from the breast milk itself. This kind of jaundice is different because it starts in the first few days of life. It is called ""breastfeeding failure jaundice,"" ""breast-non-feeding jaundice,"" or even ""starvation jaundice.""; Breast milk jaundice may run in families. It occurs just as often in males and females and affects about a third of all newborns who get only their mother's milk.; Factors in a mother's milk that help a baby absorb bilirubin from the intestine; Factors that keep certain proteins in the baby's liver from breaking down bilirubin; Babies who are born early (before 37 or 38 weeks) are not always able to feed well.; Breastfeeding failure or breast-non-feeding jaundice may also occur when feedings are scheduled by the clock (such as, every 3 hours for 10 minutes) or when babies who show signs of hunger are given pacifiers."
000996,Spinal muscular atrophy,Werdnig-Hoffmann disease; Kugelberg-Welander disease,"Symptoms of SMA may vary depending on the SMA type.; Often, weakness is first felt in the shoulder and leg muscles. Weakness gets worse over time and eventually becomes severe.; Symptoms in an infant:; Symptoms in a child:; With SMA, the nerves that control feeling (sensory nerves) are not affected. So, a person with the disease can feel things normally.; Infants with SMA type I are born with very little muscle tone, weak muscles, and feeding and breathing problems.; In infants with SMA type II, symptoms may not appear until age 6 months to 2 years.; Type III SMA is a milder disease that starts in childhood or adolescence and slowly gets worse.; Type IV is even milder, with weakness starting in adulthood.; Breathing difficulty with shortness of breath and labored breathing, leading to a lack of oxygen; Feeding difficulty (food may go into the windpipe instead of the stomach); Floppy infant (poor muscle tone); Lack of head control; Little movement; Weakness that gets worse; Frequent, increasingly severe respiratory infections; Nasal speech; Posture that gets worse","SMA is a collection of different motor nerve (or neuron) diseases. The disease is caused by a lack of a protein (SMN) due to defective genes.; Most of the time, a person must get one copy of the defective gene from both parents to be affected. The most severe form is SMA type I, also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease. Infants with SMA type II have less severe symptoms during early infancy, but they become weaker with time. SMA type III is a less severe form of the disease.; In rare cases, SMA begins in adulthood. This is the mildest form of the disease.; A family history of SMA in an immediate family member (such as brother or sister) is a risk factor for all types of the disorder."
000997,Down syndrome,Trisomy 21; Down's syndrome,"Down syndrome symptoms vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe. No matter how severe the condition is, people with Down syndrome have a widely-recognized appearance.; The head may be smaller than normal and abnormally shaped. For example, the head may be round with a flat area on the back. The inner corner of the eyes may be rounded instead of pointed.; Common physical signs include:; Physical development is often slower than normal. Most children with Down syndrome never reach average adult height.; Children may also have delayed mental and social development. Common problems may include:; As children with Down syndrome grow and become aware of their limitations, they may also feel frustration and anger.; Many different medical conditions are seen in people with Down syndrome, including:; Decreased muscle tone at birth; Excess skin at the nape of the neck; Flattened nose; Separated joints between the bones of the skull (sutures); Single crease in the palm of the hand; Small ears; Small mouth; Upward slanting eyes; Wide, short hands with short fingers; White spots on the colored part of the eye (Brushfield spots); Impulsive behavior; Poor judgment; Short attention span; Slow learning; Birth defects involving the heart, such as an atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect; DementiaÂ; Eye problems, such as cataracts (most children with Down syndrome need glasses); Early and massive vomiting, which may be a sign of a gastrointestinal blockage, such as esophageal atresia and duodenal atresia; Hearing problems, probably caused by repeated ear infections; Hip problems and risk of hipÂ dislocation; Long-term (chronic) constipation problems; Sleep apnea (because the mouth, throat, and airway are narrowed in children with Down syndrome); Teeth that appear later than normal and in a location that may cause problems with chewing; Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)","In most cases, Down syndrome occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. This form of Down syndrome is called trisomy 21. The extra chromosome causes problems with the way the body and brain develop.; Down syndrome is one of the most common causes of birth defects."
000998,Canker sore,Aphthous ulcer; Ulcer - aphthous,"Canker sores most often appear on the inner surface of the cheeks and lips, tongue, upper surface of the mouth, and the base of the gums.; Symptoms include:; Less common symptoms include:; Pain often goes away in 7 to 10 days. It can take 1 to 3 weeks for a canker sore to completely heal. Large ulcers can take longer to heal.; One or more painful, red spots or bumps that develops into an open ulcer; White or yellow center; Small size (most often under one third inch or 1 centimeter across); Gray color as healing starts; Fever; General discomfort or uneasiness (malaise); Swollen lymph nodes","Canker sores are a common form of mouth ulcer. They may occur with viral infections. In some cases, the cause is unknown.; Canker sores may also be linked to problems with the body's immune system. The sores may also be brought on by:; Other things that can trigger canker sores include:; Anyone can develop a canker sore. Women are more likely to get them than men. Canker sores may run in families.; Mouth injury from dental work; Cleaning the teeth too roughly; Biting the tongue or cheek; Emotional stress; Lack of certain vitamins and minerals in the diet (especially iron, folic acid, or vitamin B-12); Hormonal changes; Food allergies"
000999,High blood pressure and eye disease,Hypertensive retinopathy,"Most people with hypertensive retinopathy do not have symptoms until late in the disease.; Symptoms may include:; Sudden symptoms are a medical emergency. It often means that the blood pressure is very high.; Double vision, dim vision, or vision loss; Headaches","The higher the blood pressure and the longer it has been high, the more severe the damage is likely to be.; You have a higher risk of damage and vision loss when you also have diabetes, high cholesterol level, or you smoke.; Rarely, very high blood pressure develops suddenly. However, when it does, it can cause severe changes in the eye.; Other problems with the retina are also more likely, such as:; Damage to the nerves in the eye due to poor blood flow; Blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the retina; Blockage of the veins that carry blood away from the retina"
001000,Age-related macular degeneration,Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD); AMD; Vision loss - AMD,"You may not have any symptoms at first. As the disease gets worse, you may have problems with your central vision.; SYMPTOMS OF DRY AMD; The most common symptom of dry AMD is blurred vision. Objects in the center part of your vision often look distorted and dim, and colors look faded. You may have trouble reading print or seeing other details. But you can see well enough to walk and do most daily activities.; As dry AMD gets worse, you may need more light to read or do everyday tasks. A blurred spot in the center of vision gradually gets larger and darker.; In the later stages of dry AMD, you may not be able to recognize faces until they are close.; SYMPTOMS OF WET AMD; The most common early symptom of wet AMD is that straight lines look distorted and wavy.; There may be a small dark spot in the center of your vision that gets larger over time.; With both types of AMD, central vision loss can occur quickly. If this happens, you will need to be seen right away by an ophthalmologist. Make sure this eye doctor has experience in treating problems with the retina.","The retina is at the back of the eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. A part of the retina called the macula makes vision sharper and more detailed. It is a yellow spot in the center of the retina. It has a high amount of two natural colors (pigments) called lutein and zeaxanthin.; AMD is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the macula. This change also harms the macula.; There are two types of AMD:; Health care providers are not sure what causes AMD. The condition is rare before age 55. It occurs mostly in people 75 years or older.; Risk factors for AMD are:; Dry AMD occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. Small yellow deposits, called drusen, form. Almost all people with macular degeneration start with the dry form.; Wet AMD occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. New abnormal and very fragile blood vessels grow under the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid. This type of AMD causes most of the vision loss associated with the condition.; Family history of AMD; Being White; Cigarette smoking; High-fat diet; Being female"
001001,Cataract - adult,Lens opacity; Age-related cataract; Vision loss - cataract,"Cataracts develop slowly and painlessly. Vision in the affected eye slowly gets worse.; Problems with seeing may include:; Cataracts lead to decreased vision, even in daylight. Most people with cataracts have similar changes in both eyes, though one eye may be worse than the other. Often there are only mild vision changes.; Mild clouding of the lens often occurs after age 60. But it may not cause any vision problems.; By age 75, most people have cataracts that affect their vision.; Being sensitive to glare; Cloudy, fuzzy, foggy, or filmy vision; Difficulty seeing at night or in dim light; Double vision; Loss of color intensity; Problems seeing shapes against a background or the difference between shades of colors; Seeing halos around lights; Frequent changes in eyeglass prescriptions","The lens of the eye is normally clear. It acts like the lens on a camera, focusing light as it passes to the back of the eye.; Until a person is around age 45, the shape of the lens is able to change. This allows the lens to focus on an object, whether it is close or far away.; As a person ages, proteins in the lens begin to break down. This makes the lens less flexible so that it is harder to focus on near objects. Over time, the lens becomes cloudy. What the eye sees may appear blurry at all distances. This condition is known as a cataract.; Factors that may speed cataract formation are:; Diabetes; Eye inflammation; Eye injury; Family history of cataracts; Long-term use of corticosteroids (taken by mouth) or certain other medicines; Radiation exposure; Smoking; Surgery for another eye problem; Too much exposure to ultraviolet light (sunlight)"
001002,Color blindness,Color deficiency; Blindness - color,"Symptoms vary from person to person, but may include:; Often, symptoms are so mild that people may not know they are color blind. A parent may notice signs of color blindness when a young child is first learning colors.; Rapid, side-to-side eye movements (nystagmus) and other symptoms may occur in severe cases.; Trouble seeing colors and the brightness of colors in the usual way; Inability to tell the difference between shades of the same or similar colors","Color blindness occurs when there is a problem with the pigments in certain nerve cells of the eye that sense color. These cells are called cones. They are found in the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, called the retina.; If just one pigment is missing, you may have trouble telling the difference between red and green. This is the most common type of color blindness. If a different pigment is missing, you may have trouble seeing blue-yellow colors. People with blue-yellow color blindness often have problems seeing reds and greens, too.; The most severe form of color blindness is achromatopsia. This is a rare condition in which a person cannot see any color, only shades of gray.; Most color blindness is due to a genetic problem. About 1 in 10 men have some form of color blindness. Very few women are color blind.; The drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) can also cause color blindness. It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions."
001003,Scleritis,Inflammation - sclera,Symptoms of scleritis include:; A rare form of this disease causes no eye pain or redness.; Blurred vision; Eye pain and tenderness -- severe; Red patches on the normally white part of the eye; Sensitivity to light -- very painful; Tearing of the eye,Scleritis is often linked to autoimmune diseases. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are examples of autoimmune diseases that can be associated with scleritis. Sometimes the cause is unknown.; Scleritis occurs most often in people between the ages of 30 and 60. It is rare in children.
001004,Strabismus,Crossed eyes; Esotropia; Exotropia; Hypotropia; Hypertropia; Squint; Walleye; Misalignment of the eyes,Symptoms of strabismus may be present all the time or may come and go. Symptoms can include:; It is important to note that children may never be aware of double vision. This is because amblyopia can develop quickly.; Crossed eyes; Double vision; Eyes that do not aim in the same direction; Uncoordinated eye movements (eyes do not move together); Loss of vision or depth perception,"Six different muscles surround each eye and work ""as a team."" This allows both eyes to focus on the same object.; In someone with strabismus, these muscles do not work together. As a result, one eye looks at one object, while the other eye turns in a different direction and looks at another object.; When this occurs, two different images are sent to the brain -- one from each eye. This confuses the brain. In children, the brain may learn to ignore (suppress) the image from the weaker eye.; If the strabismus is not treated, the eye that the brain ignores will never see well. This loss of vision is called amblyopia. Another name for amblyopia is ""lazy eye."" Sometimes lazy eye is present first, and it causes strabismus.; In most children with strabismus, the cause is unknown. In more than one half of these cases, the problem is present at or shortly after birth. This is called congenital strabismus.; Most of the time, the problem has to do with muscle control, and not with muscle strength.; Other disorders associated with strabismus in children include:; Strabismus that develops in adults can be caused by:; A family history of strabismus is a risk factor. Farsightedness may be a contributing factor, often in children. Any other disease that causes vision loss may also cause strabismus.; Apert syndrome; Cerebral palsy; Congenital rubella; Hemangioma near the eye during infancy; Incontinentia pigmenti syndrome; Noonan syndrome; Prader-Willi syndrome; Retinopathy of prematurity; Retinoblastoma; Traumatic brain injury; Trisomy 18; Botulism; Diabetes (causes a condition known as acquired paralytic strabismus); Graves disease; Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome; Injury to the eye; Shellfish poisoning; Stroke; Traumatic brain injury; Vision loss from any eye disease or injury"
001005,Uveitis,Iritis; Pars planitis; Choroiditis; Chorioretinitis; Anterior uveitis; Posterior uveitis; Iridocyclitis,"Uveitis can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms depend on which part of the uvea is inflamed. Symptoms may develop rapidly and can include:; Blurred vision; Dark, floating spots in the vision; Eye pain; Redness of the eye; Sensitivity to light","Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are:; Uveitis can also be caused by infections such as:; Exposure to toxins or injury can also cause uveitis. In many cases, the cause is unknown.; Often the inflammation is limited to only part of the uvea. The most common form of uveitis involves inflammation of the iris, in the front part of the eye. In this case, the condition is called iritis. In most cases, it occurs in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people.; Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the eye. It involves primarily the choroid. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle layer of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis.; Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. Inflammation occurs in the area called the pars plana, which is located between the iris and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn disease and possibly multiple sclerosis.; Ankylosing spondylitis; Behcet disease; Psoriasis; Reactive arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sarcoidosis; Ulcerative colitis; AIDS; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis; Herpes zoster infection; Histoplasmosis; Kawasaki disease; Syphilis; Toxoplasmosis"
001006,Chalazion,Meibomian gland lipogranuloma,"A chalazion often develops following an internal hordeolum (also called a stye). The eyelid most often becomes tender, red, swollen and warm. Sometimes, the blocked gland causing the stye will not drain even though the redness and swelling go away. The gland will form a firm nodule in the eyelid that is not tender. This is called a chalazion.","A chalazion is caused by a blocked duct in one of the meibomian glands. These glands are located in the eyelid directly behind the eyelashes. They produce a thin, oily fluid that lubricates the eye."
001007,Ectropion,,"Symptoms include:; If you have ectropion, you will most likely have excess tearing. This happens because the eye gets dry, then makes more tears. The excess tears can't get into the tear drainage duct. Therefore, they build up inside the lower lid and then spill over the edge of the lid onto the cheek.; Dry, painful eyes; Excess tearing of the eye (epiphora); Eyelid turns outward (downward); Long-term (chronic) conjunctivitis; Keratitis; Redness of the lid and white part of the eye","Ectropion is very often caused by the aging process. The connective (supporting) tissue of the eyelid becomes weak. This causes the lid to turn out so that the inside of the lower lid is no longer against the eyeball. It can also be caused by:; A defect that occurs before birth (for example, in children with Down syndrome); Facial muscle weakness; Scar tissue from burns or injuries"
001008,Entropion,Eyelid - entropion; Eye pain - entropion; Tearing - entropion,Symptoms include:; Decreased vision if the cornea is damaged; Excessive tearing; Eye discomfort or pain; Eye irritation; Redness,"Entropion can be present at birth (congenital).; In babies, it rarely causes problems because the lashes are very soft and do not easily damage the eye. In older people, the condition is most often caused by a spasm or weakening of the muscles surrounding the lower part of the eye.; Another cause can be trachoma infection, which can lead to scarring of the inner side of the lid. This is rare in North America and Europe. However, trachoma scarring is one of the three leading causes of blindness in the world.; Risk factors for entropion are:; Aging; Chemical burn; Infection with trachoma"
001009,Eyelid bump,Bump on the eyelid; Stye; Hordeolum,"In addition to the red, swollen bump, other possible symptoms of a stye include:; A gritty, scratchy sensation, as if there is a foreign body in your eye; Sensitivity to light; Tearing of your eye; Tenderness of the eyelid","A stye is caused by a blockage of one of the oil glands in the eyelids. This allows bacteria to grow inside the blocked gland. Styes are a lot like common acne pimples that occur elsewhere on the skin. You may have more than one stye at the same time.; Styes most often develop over a few days. They may drain and heal on their own. A stye can become a chalazion, which occurs when an inflamed oil gland becomes fully blocked. If a chalazion gets large enough, it can cause trouble with your vision.; Styes can be made worse by the presence of Demodex, a mite commonly found on human skin. Demodex has been identified as a cause of blepharitis. If you have blepharitis, you are more likely to get styes.; Other possible common eyelid bumps include:; Xanthelasma: Raised yellow patches on your eyelids that can happen with age. These are harmless, although they are sometimes a sign of high cholesterol.; Papillomas: Pink or skin-colored bumps. They are harmless, but can slowly grow, affect your vision, or bother you for cosmetic reasons. If so, they can be surgically removed.; Cysts: Small fluid-filled sacs that can affect your vision."
001010,Conjunctivitis or pink eye,"Inflammation - conjunctiva; Pink eye; Chemical conjunctivitis, Pinkeye; Pink-eye; Allergic conjunctivitis",Symptoms include:; Blurred vision; Crusts that form on the eyelid overnight (most often caused by bacteria); Eye pain; Gritty feeling in the eyes; Increased tearing; Itching of the eye; Redness in the eyes; Sensitivity to light,"Tears most often protect the eyes by washing away germs and irritants. Tears contain proteins and antibodies that kill germs. If your eyes are dry, germs and irritants are more likely to cause problems.; Conjunctivitis is most often caused by germs such as viruses and bacteria.; A type of long-term allergic conjunctivitis may occur in people who have chronic allergies or asthma. This condition is called vernal conjunctivitis. It most commonly occurs in young men and boys in the spring and summer months. A similar condition can occur in long-time contact lens wearers. It may make it difficult to continue to wear contact lenses.; Anything which irritates the eye may also cause conjunctivitis. These include:; ""Pink eye"" most often refers to a highly contagious viral infection that spreads easily among children.; Conjunctivitis can be found in people with COVID-19 before they have other typical symptoms.; In newborns, an eye infection may be caused by bacteria in the birth canal. This must be treated at once to preserve eyesight.; Allergic conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva becomes inflamed due to a reaction to pollen, dander, mold, or other allergy-causing substances.; Chemicals.; Smoke.; Dust.; Over-use of contact lenses (often extended-wear lenses) can lead to conjunctivitis."
001011,Pterygium,,"The main symptom of a pterygium is a painless area of raised white tissue that has blood vessels on the inner or outer edge of the cornea. Sometimes the pterygium has no symptoms. However, it may become inflamed and cause burning, irritation, or a feeling like there's something foreign in the eye. Vision may be affected if the growth extends far enough onto the cornea.","The exact cause is unknown. It is more common in people who have a lot of exposure to sunlight and wind, such as people who work outdoors.; Risk factors are exposure to sunny, dusty, sandy, or windblown areas. Farmers, fishermen, and people living near the equator are often affected. Pterygium is rare in children."
001012,Orbital cellulitis,,"Symptoms may include:; Painful swelling of upper and lower eyelid, and possibly the eyebrow and cheek; Bulging eyes; Decreased vision; Pain when moving the eye; Fever, often 102Â°F (38.8Â°C) or higher; General ill feeling; Difficulty with eye movements; Double vision; Shiny, red or purple eyelid","Orbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection, which can cause lasting problems. Orbital cellulitis is different than periorbital cellulitis, which is an infection of the eyelid or skin around the eye.; In children, it often starts out as a sinus infection from bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza. The infection used to be more common in young children, under the age of 7. It is now rare due to a vaccine that helps prevent this infection.; The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci may also cause orbital cellulitis.; Orbital cellulitis infections in children may get worse very quickly and can lead to visual difficulties or blindness. Medical care is needed right away."
001013,Keratoconus,Vision changes - keratoconus,"The earliest symptom is a slight blurring of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses. (Vision can most often be corrected to 20/20 with rigid, gas-permeable contact lenses.) Over time, you may see halos, have glare, or other night vision problems.; Most people who develop keratoconus have a history of being nearsighted. The nearsightedness tends to become worse over time. As the problem gets worse, astigmatism develops and may worsen over time.; Keratoconus is often discovered during the teenage years. It may also develop in older people.",The cause is unknown. It is likely that the tendency to develop keratoconus is present from birth. The condition may be due to a defect in collagen. This is the tissue that provides the shape and strength to the cornea.; Allergy and eye rubbing may speed up the damage.; There is a link between keratoconus and Down syndrome.
001014,Amblyopia,Lazy eye; Vision loss - amblyopia,Symptoms of the condition include:; Eyes that turn in or out; Eyes that do not appear to work together; Inability to judge depth correctly; Poor vision in one eye,"Amblyopia occurs when the nerve pathway from one eye to the brain does not develop during childhood. This problem develops because the abnormal eye sends the wrong image to the brain. This is the case in strabismus (crossed eyes). In other eye problems, a blurred image is sent to the brain. This confuses the brain, and the brain may learn to ignore the image from the weaker eye.; Strabismus is the most common cause of amblyopia. Having a family member with strabismus, increases your chance of having strabismus.; The term ""lazy eye"" refers to amblyopia, which often occurs along with strabismus. However, amblyopia can occur due to something other than strabismus. Also, people can have strabismus without amblyopia.; Other causes include:; In strabismus, the only problem with the eye itself is that it is pointed in the wrong direction. If poor vision is caused by a problem with the eyeball, such as cataracts, amblyopia will still need to be treated, even if the cataracts are removed. Amblyopia may not develop if both eyes have equally poor vision.; Childhood cataracts; Farsightedness, nearsightedness, or astigmatism, especially if it is greater in one eye"
001015,Astigmatism,,"Astigmatism makes it hard to see fine details, either close up or from a distance.","People are able to see because the front part of the eye bends (refracts) light and focuses it on the retina. This is the inside of the back surface of the eye.; If the light rays are not clearly focused on the retina, the images you see may be blurry.; With astigmatism, the cornea is abnormally curved. This curve causes vision to be out of focus.; The cause of astigmatism is unknown. It is most often present from birth. Astigmatism often occurs together with nearsightedness or farsightedness. If astigmatism gets worse, it may be a sign of keratoconus.; Astigmatism is very common. It sometimes occurs after certain types of eye surgery, such as cataract surgery."
001016,Blocked tear duct,Dacryostenosis; Blocked nasolacrimal duct; Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO),"The main symptom is increased tearing (epiphora), which causes tears to overflow onto the face or cheek. In babies, this tearing becomes noticeable during the first 2Â to 3 weeks after birth.; Sometimes, the tears may appear to be thicker. The tears may dry and become crusty.; If there is pus in the eyes or the eyelids get stuck together, your baby may have an eye infection called conjunctivitis.","Tears are constantly being made to help protect the surface of your eye. They drain into a very small opening (punctum) in the corner of your eye, near your nose. This opening is the entrance to the nasolacrimal duct. If this duct is blocked, the tears will build up and overflow onto the cheek. This occurs even when you are not crying.; In children, the duct may not be completely developed at birth. It may be closed or covered by a thin film, which causes a partial blockage.; In adults, the duct can be damaged by an infection, injury, or a tumor."
001017,Corneal injury,Abrasion - corneal; Scratch - corneal; Eye pain - corneal,Symptoms include:; Blurred vision; Eye pain or stinging and burning in the eye; Feeling like something is in your eye (may be caused by a scratch or something in your eye); Light sensitivity; Redness of the eye; Swollen eyelids; Watery eyes or increased tearing,"Injuries to the cornea are common.; Injuries to the outer surface may be due to:; Infections may also damage the cornea.; You are more likely to develop a corneal injury if you:; High-speed particles, such as chips from hammering metal on metal, may get stuck in the surface of the cornea. Rarely, they may penetrate deeper into the eye.; Abrasions -- Includes scratches or scrapes on the surface of the cornea; Chemical injuries -- Caused by almost any fluid that gets into the eye; Contact lens problems -- Overuse, poor fit, or sensitivity to contact lens care solutions; Foreign bodies -- Exposure to something in the eye such as sand or dust; Ultraviolet injuries-- Caused by sunlight, sun lamps, snow or water reflections, or arc-welding; Are exposed to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light for long periods of time; Have ill-fitting contact lenses or overuse your contact lenses; Have very dry eyes; Work in a dusty environment; Use a hammer or power tools without wearing safety glasses"
001018,Eyelid drooping,Ptosis; Dermatochalasis; Blepharoptosis; Third nerve palsy - ptosis; Baggy eyelids,"Drooping may be present in one or both eyelids depending on the cause. The lid may cover only the upper eye, or the entire pupil may be covered.; Problems with vision will often be present:; Increased tearing despite a feeling of dry eyes may be noticed.; At first, just a sense that the very upper field of vision is being blocked.; When the drooping eyelid covers the pupil of the eye, vision may become completely blocked.; Children may tip their head back to help them see under the eyelid.; Tiredness and achiness around the eyes may also be present.","A drooping eyelid is most often due to:; Drooping eyelid can be:; Diseases or illnesses that may lead to eyelid drooping include:; Weakness of the muscle that raises the eyelid; Damage to the nerves that control that muscle; Looseness of the skin of the upper eyelids; Caused by the normal aging process; Present before birth; The result of an injury or disease; Tumor around or behind the eye; Diabetes; Horner syndrome; Myasthenia gravis; Stroke; Swelling in the eyelid, such as with a stye"
001019,Episcleritis,,Symptoms include:; A pink or purple color to the normally white part of the eye; Eye pain; Eye tenderness; Sensitivity to light; Tearing of the eye,"Episcleritis is a common condition. In most cases the problem is mild and vision is normal.; The cause is often unknown. But, it may occur with certain diseases, such as:; Herpes zoster virus; Rheumatoid arthritis; SjÃ¶gren syndrome; Syphilis; Tuberculosis"
001020,Farsightedness,Hyperopia,"Symptoms include:; Mild farsightedness may not cause any problems. However, you may need reading glasses sooner than people who do not have this condition.; Aching eyes; Blurred vision when looking at close objects; Crossed eyes (strabismus) in some children; Eye strain; Headache while reading","Farsightedness is the result of the visual image being focused behind the retina rather than directly on it. It may be caused by the eyeball being too small or the focusing power being too weak. It can also be a combination of both.; Farsightedness is often present from birth. However, children have a very flexible eye lens, which helps make up for the problem. As aging occurs, glasses or contact lenses may be needed to correct the vision. If you have family members who are farsighted, you are also more likely to become farsighted."
001021,Hyphema,,"Symptoms include:; You may not be able to see a small hyphema when looking at your eye in the mirror. With a total hyphema, the collection of blood will block the view of the iris and pupil.; Bleeding in the anterior chamber of the eye; Eye pain; Light sensitivity; Vision abnormalities",Hyphema is most often caused by trauma to the eye. Other causes of bleeding in the front chamber of the eye include:; Blood vessel abnormality; Cancer of the eye; Severe inflammation of the iris; Advanced diabetes; Blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia
001022,Melanoma of the eye,Malignant melanoma - choroid; Malignant melanoma - eye; Eye tumor; Ocular melanoma,"Symptoms of melanoma of the eye may include any of the following:; In some cases, there may be no symptoms.; Bulging eyes; Change in iris color; Poor vision in one eye; Red, painful eye; Small defect on the iris or conjunctiva","Melanoma is a very aggressive type of cancer that can spread rapidly. It usually is a type of skin cancer.; Melanoma of the eye can affect several parts of the eye, including the:; The choroid layer is the most likely site of melanoma in the eye. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue between the white of the eye and retina (back of the eye).; The cancer may only be in the eye. Or, it may spread (metastasize) to another location in the body, most commonly the liver. Melanoma can also begin on the skin or other organs in the body and spread to the eye.; Melanoma is the most common type of eye tumor in adults. Even so, melanoma that starts in the eye is rare.; Too much exposure to sunlight is an important risk factor for melanoma. People who have fair skin and blue eyes are most affected.; Choroid; Ciliary body; Conjunctiva; Eyelid; Iris; Orbit"
001023,Nearsightedness,Myopia; Shortsightedness; Refractive error - nearsightedness,"A nearsighted person sees close-up objects clearly, but objects in the distance are blurred. Squinting will tend to make far away objects seem clearer.; Nearsightedness is often first noticed in school-aged children or teenagers. Children often cannot read the blackboard, but they can easily read a book.; Nearsightedness gets worse during the growth years. People who are nearsighted may need to change glasses or contact lenses often. Nearsightedness most often stops progressing as a person stops growing in his or her early twenties.; Other symptoms may include:; Eyestrain; Headaches (uncommon)","People are able to see because the front part of the eye bends (refracts) light and focuses it on the retina. This is the inside of the back surface of the eye.; Nearsightedness occurs when there is a mismatch between the focusing power of the eye and the length of the eye. Light rays are focused in front of the retina, rather than directly on it. As a result, what you see is blurry. Most of the eye's focusing power comes from the cornea.; Nearsightedness affects males and females equally. People who have a family history of nearsightedness are more likely to develop it. Most eyes with nearsightedness are healthy. However, a small number of people with severe nearsightedness develop a form of retinal degeneration.; The predominant wavelength of light in your environment may affect the development of myopia. Recent research suggests that more time outdoors during childhood may lead to less myopia."
001024,Optic glioma,Glioma - optic; Optic nerve glioma; Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma; Brain cancer - optic glioma,"The symptoms are due to the tumor growing and pressing on the optic nerve and nearby structures. Symptoms may include:; The child may show symptoms of diencephalic syndrome, which includes:; Involuntary eyeball movement; Outward bulging of one or both eyes; Squinting; Vision loss in one or both eyes that starts with the loss of peripheral vision and eventually leads to blindness; Daytime sleeping; Decreased memory and brain function; Headaches; Delayed growth; Loss of body fat; Vomiting","Optic gliomas are rare. The cause of optic gliomas is unknown. Most optic gliomas are slow-growing and noncancerous (benign) and occur in children, almost always before age 20. Most cases are diagnosed by 5 years of age.; There is a strong association between optic glioma and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)."
001025,Pinguecula,,"A pingueculum looks like a small, yellowish bump on the conjunctiva near the cornea. It can appear on either side of the cornea. However, it more often occurs on the nose (nasal) side. The growth may increase in size, but usually over many years.",The exact cause is unknown. Long-term sunlight exposure and eye irritation may be factors. Arc-welding is a major job-related risk.
001026,Presbyopia,,Symptoms include:; Decreased focusing ability for near objects; Eyestrain; Headache,"The lens of the eye needs to change shape to focus on objects that are close. The ability of the lens to change shape is because of the elasticity of the lens. This elasticity decreases slowly as people age. The result is a slow loss in the ability of the eye to focus on nearby objects.; People most often begin to notice the condition at around age 45, when they realize that they need to hold reading materials farther away in order to focus on them. Presbyopia is a natural part of the aging process and it affects everyone."
001027,Retinal detachment,Detached retina,"Symptoms of detached retina can include:; There is usually no pain in or around the eye.; Bright flashes of light, especially in peripheral vision.; Blurred vision.; New floaters in the eye that appear suddenly.; Shadowing or decreased peripheral vision that seems like a curtain or shade across your vision.","The retina is the clear tissue that lines the inside of the back of the eye. Light rays that enter the eye are focused by the cornea and lens into images that are formed on the retina.; When the retina becomes detached, bleeding from nearby blood vessels can cloud the inside of the eye so that you may not see clearly or at all. Central vision becomes severely affected if the macula becomes detached. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.; The most common type of retinal detachment is often due to a tear or hole in the retina. This type of detachment is called a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Eye fluid may leak through this opening. This causes the retina to separate from the underlying tissues, much like a bubble under wallpaper. This is most often caused by a condition called posterior vitreous detachment. It can also be caused by trauma and severe nearsightedness. A family history of retinal detachment also increases your risk.; Another type of retinal detachment is called tractional detachment. This type occurs in people who have uncontrolled diabetes, had retinal surgery before, or have long-term (chronic) inflammation."
001028,Retinal artery occlusion,Central retinal artery occlusion; CRAO; Branch retinal artery occlusion; BRAO; Vision loss - retinal artery occlusion; Blurry vision - retinal artery occlusion,"Sudden blurring or loss of vision may occur in:; The retinal artery occlusion may last for only a few seconds or minutes, or it may be permanent.; A blood clot in the eye may be a warning sign of clots elsewhere. A clot in the brain may cause a stroke.; All of one eye (central retinal artery occlusion or CRAO); Part of one eye (branch retinal artery occlusion or BRAO)","Retinal arteries may become blocked when a blood clot or fat deposits get stuck in the arteries. These blockages are more likely if there is hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) in the eye.; Clots may travel from other parts of the body and block an artery in the retina. The most common sources of clots are the heart and carotid artery in the neck.; Most blockages occur in people with conditions such as:; If a branch of the retinal artery is blocked, part of the retina will not receive enough blood and oxygen. If this happens, you may lose part of your vision.; Carotid artery disease, in which the two large blood vessels in the neck become narrowed or blocked; Diabetes; Heart rhythm problem (mainlyÂ atrial fibrillation); Heart valve problem; High levels of fat in the blood (hyperlipidemia); High blood pressure; Intravenous drug abuse; Temporal arteritis (inflammation of arteries due to an immune response)"

However, severe vision problems do not often develop before early adulthood.; Decreased vision at night or in low light. Early signs may include having a harder time moving around in the dark.; Loss of side (peripheral) vision, causing ""tunnel vision.""; Loss of central vision (in advanced cases). This will affect the ability to read.; Loss of color vision; Sensitivity to bright light","Retinitis pigmentosa can run in families. The disorder can be caused by several genetic defects.; The cells controlling night vision (rods) are most likely to be affected. However, in some cases, retinal cone cells are damaged the most. The main sign of the disease is the presence of dark deposits in the retina.; The main risk factor is a family history of retinitis pigmentosa. It is a rare condition affecting about 1 in 4,000 people in the United States."
001030,Retinoblastoma,Tumor - retina; Cancer - retina; Eye cancer - retinoblastoma,"One or both eyes may be affected.; The pupil of the eye may appear white or have white spots. A white glow in the eye is often seen in photographs taken with a flash. Instead of the typical ""red eye"" from the flash, the pupil may appear white or distorted.; Other symptoms may include:; If the cancer has spread, bone pain and other symptoms may occur.; Crossed eyesÂ (strabismus); Double vision; Eyes that do not align; Eye pain and redness; Poor vision; Differing iris colors in each eye","Retinoblastoma is caused by a mutation in a gene that controls how cells divide. As a result, cells grow out of control and become cancerous.; In about half the cases, this mutation develops in a child whose family has never had eye cancer. In other cases, the mutation occurs in several family members. If the mutation runs in the family, there is a 50% chance that an affected person's children will also have the mutation. These children will therefore have a high risk of developing retinoblastoma themselves.; The cancer most often affects children younger than 7 years old. It is most commonly diagnosed in children 1 to 2 years old."
001031,Allergic conjunctivitis,Conjunctivitis - allergic seasonal/perennial; Atopic keratoconjunctivitis; Pink eye - allergic,"Symptoms may be seasonal and can include:; Intense itching or burning eyes; Puffy eyelids, most often in the morning; Red eyes; Stringy eye discharge; Tearing (watery eyes); Widened blood vessels in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye","When your eyes are exposed to allergy-causing substances, a substance called histamine is released by your body. The blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen. The eyes can become red, itchy, and teary very quickly.; The pollens that cause symptoms vary from person to person and from area to area. Tiny, hard-to-see pollens that may cause allergic symptoms include grasses, ragweed and trees. These same pollens may also cause hay fever.; Your symptoms may be worse when there is more pollen in the air. Higher levels of pollen are more likely on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days most pollen is washed to the ground.; Mold, animal dander, or dust mites may cause this problem also.; Allergies tend to run in families. It is hard to know exactly how many people have allergies. Many conditions are often lumped under the term ""allergy"" even when they might not truly be an allergy."

These sack-like lumps are made up of dead skin cells and oils produced by oil glands in the skin.; Places they are likely to be found include:; The exact cause of the problem is unknown. Cysts may occur when oils are produced in a skin gland faster than they can be released from the gland. They can also occur if the oil gland opening has become blocked and a cyst forms under the skin.; Benign bony tumors of the ear canal (exostoses and osteomas) are caused by excess growth of bone.

It may be passed down through families.; People who have otosclerosis have an abnormal extension of sponge-like bone growing in the middle ear cavity. This growth prevents the ear bones from vibrating normally in response to sound waves. These vibrations are needed in order for you to hear.; Otosclerosis is the most common cause of middle ear hearing loss in young adults. It typically begins in early to mid-adulthood. It is more common in women than in men. The condition may affect one or both ears.; Risks for this condition include pregnancy and a family history of hearing loss. White people are more likely to develop this condition than people of other races.

The swelling gradually increases.; Difficulty moving one side of the face, known as facial nerve palsy.","The salivary glands are located around the mouth. They produce saliva, which moistens food to help with chewing and swallowing. Saliva also helps to protect teeth from decay.; There are 3 main pairs of salivary glands. The parotid glands are the largest. They are located in each cheek in front of the ears. Two submandibular glands are under the floor of the mouth on both sides of the back of the jaw. Two sublingual glands are under the floor of the mouth next to the jaw on each side. There are also hundreds of small salivary glands lining the rest of the mouth. These are called the minor salivary glands.; Salivary glands empty saliva into the mouth through ducts that open at various places in the mouth.; Salivary gland tumors are rare. Swelling of the salivary glands is mostly due to:; The most common type of salivary gland tumor is a slow-growing noncancerous (benign) tumor of the parotid gland. The tumor gradually increases the size of the gland. Some of these tumors can be cancerous (malignant).; Cirrhosis of the liver; Other cancers; Salivary duct stones; Salivary gland infections; Dehydration; Sarcoidosis; SjÃ¶gren syndrome"

They include:; Bad breath; Crater-like ulcers between the teeth; Fever; Foul taste in the mouth; Gums appear red and swollen; Grayish film on the gums; Painful gums; Severe gum bleeding in response to any pressure or irritation,"Trench mouth is a painful form of gum swelling (gingivitis). The mouth normally contains a balance of different bacteria. Trench mouth occurs when there is too much pathologic bacteria. The gums become infected and develop painful ulcers. Viruses may be involved in allowing the bacteria to grow too much.; Things that increase your risk of trench mouth include:; Trench mouth is rare. When it does occur, it most often affects people ages 15 to 35.; Emotional stress (such as studying for exams); Poor oral hygiene; Poor nutrition; Smoking; Weak immune system; Throat, tooth, or mouth infections"

They pick up sound waves and change them into the nerve signals that your brain interprets as sound. Hearing loss occurs when the tiny hair cells are damaged or die. The hair cells do not regrow, so hearing loss caused by hair cell damage is permanent.; There is no known single cause of age-related hearing loss. Most commonly, it is caused by changes in the inner ear that occur as you grow older. Your genes and loud noise (for example from loud concerts or music headphones) may play a role.; The following factors contribute to age-related hearing loss:; Family history (age-related hearing loss tends to run in families); Repeated exposure to loud noises; Smoking (smokers are more likely to have such hearing loss than nonsmokers); Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes; Certain medicines, such as chemotherapy drugs for cancer"
001046,Leukoplakia,Hairy leukoplakia; Smoker's keratosis,"Patches in the mouth usually develop on the tongue (sides of the tongue with oral hairy leukoplakia) and on the insides of the cheeks.; Leukoplakia patches are:; Most often white or gray; Uneven in shape; Fuzzy (oral hairy leukoplakia); Slightly raised, with a hard surface; Unable to be scraped off; Painful when the mouth patches come into contact with acidic or spicy food","Leukoplakia affects the mucous membranes of the mouth. The exact cause is not known. It may be due to irritation such as:; The disorder is more common in older adults.; A type of leukoplakia of the mouth, called oral hairy leukoplakia, is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. It is seen mostly in people with HIV/AIDS. It may be one of the first signs of HIV infection. Oral hairy leukoplakia can also appear in other people whose immune system is not working well, such as after a bone marrow transplant.; Rough teeth; Rough places on dentures, fillings, and crowns; Smoking or other tobacco use (smoker's keratosis), especially pipes; Holding chewing tobacco or snuff in the mouth for a long period of time; Drinking a lot of alcohol"

This may block the airway or prevent you from swallowing saliva.; Symptoms include:; Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:; Breathing difficulty; Difficulty swallowing; Drooling; Unusual speech (sounds like the person has a ""hot potato"" in the mouth); Tongue swelling or protrusion of the tongue out of the mouth; Fever; Neck pain; Tooth pain; Neck swelling; Redness of the neck; Weakness, fatigue, excess tiredness; Confusion or other mental changes; Earache","Ludwig angina is a type of bacterial infection that occurs in the floor of the mouth, under the tongue. It often develops after an infection of the roots of the teeth (such as tooth abscess) or a mouth injury.; This condition is uncommon in children."
001048,Occupational hearing loss,Hearing loss - occupational; Noise-induced hearing loss; Noise notch,The main symptom is partial or complete hearing loss. The hearing loss will likely get worse over time with continued exposure.; Noise in the ear (tinnitus) may accompany hearing loss.,"Over time, repeated exposure to loud noise or music can cause hearing loss.; Sounds above 80 decibels (dB, a measurement of the loudness or strength of sound vibration) may cause vibrations intense enough to damage the inner ear. This is more likely to happen if the sound continues for a long time.; Examples of sound intensity are:; A general rule of thumb is that if you need to shout to be heard, the sound is in the range that can damage hearing.; Some jobs carry a high risk for hearing loss, such as:; In the United States, laws regulate the maximum job noise exposure that it is allowed. Both the length of exposure and decibel level are considered. If the sound is at or greater than the maximum levels recommended, you need to take steps to protect your hearing.; 90 dB -- a large truck 5 yards (4.5 meters) away (motorcycles, snowmobiles, and similar engines range from 85 to 90 dB); 100 dB -- some rock concerts; 120 dB -- a jackhammer about 3 feet (1 meter) away; 130 dB -- a jet engine from 100 feet (30 meters) away; Airline ground maintenance; Construction; Farming; Jobs involving loud music or machinery; Military jobs that involve combat, aircraft noise, or other posts with loud noises"
001049,Geographic tongue,Patches on the tongue; Tongue - patchy; Benign migratory glossitis; Glossitis - benign migratory,"Symptoms include:; Map-like appearance to the surface of the tongue; Patches that move from day to day; Smooth, red patches and sores (lesions) on the tongue; Soreness and burning pain (in some cases)","The exact cause of geographic tongue is unknown. It may be due to irritation from hot or spicy foods, or alcohol. The condition appears to be less common in smokers.; The change in pattern on the surface of the tongue occurs when there is a loss of the tiny, finger-like projections, called papillae, on the tongue. These areas look flat as a result. The appearance of the tongue may change very quickly. The flat-looking areas may remain for more than a month."
001050,Cholesteatoma,Chronic ear infection - cholesteatoma; Chronic otitis media - cholesteatoma,"Symptoms include:; Dizziness; Drainage from the ear, which can be chronic; Hearing loss in one ear; Sensation of ear fullness or pressure","Cholesteatoma can be a birth defect (congenital). It more commonly occurs as a result of chronic ear infection.; The eustachian tube helps equalize pressure in the middle ear. When it is not working well, negative pressure can build up and pull part of the eardrum (tympanic membrane) inward. This creates a pocket or cyst that fills with old skin cells and other waste material.; The cyst may become infected or get bigger. This can cause the breakdown of some of the middle ear bones or other structures of the ear. This can affect hearing, balance, and possibly the function of the facial muscles."
001051,Cleft lip and palate,Cleft palate; Craniofacial defect,A child may have one or more birth defects and the severity can vary significantly.; A cleft lip may be just a small notch in the lip. It may also be a complete split in the lip that goes all the way to the base of the nose.; A cleft palate can be on one or both sides of the roof of the mouth. It may go the full length of the palate.; Other symptoms include:; Problems that may be present because of a cleft lip or palate are:; Change in nose shape (how much the shape changes varies); Poorly aligned teeth; Failure to gain weight; Feeding problems; Flow of milk through nasal passages during feeding; Poor growth; Repeated ear infections; Speech difficulties,"There are many causes of cleft lip and palate. Problems with genes passed down from 1 or both parents, drugs, viruses, or other toxins can all cause these birth defects. Cleft lip and palate may occur along with other syndromes or birth defects.; A cleft lip and palate can:; Babies are more likely to be born with a cleft lip and palate if they have a family history of these conditions or other birth defects.; Affect the appearance of the face; Lead to problems with feeding and speech; Lead to ear infections"
001052,Gingivostomatitis,,"The symptoms can be mild or severe and may include:; Bad breath; Fever; General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise); Sores on the inside of the cheeks or gums; Very sore mouth with no desire to eat","Gingivostomatitis is common among children. It may occur after infection with the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which also causes cold sores.; The condition may also occur after infection with a coxsackie virus.; It may occur in people with poor oral hygiene."
001053,Glossitis,Tongue inflammation; Tongue infection; Smooth tongue; Glossodynia; Burning tongue syndrome,"Symptoms of glossitis may come on quickly or develop over time. They include:; Rare symptoms or problems include:; Problems chewing, swallowing, or speaking; Smooth surface of the tongue; Sore, tender, or swollen tongue; Pale or bright red color to the tongue; Blocked airway; Problems speaking, chewing, or swallowing","Glossitis is often a symptom of other conditions, such as:; At times, glossitis may be passed down in families.; Allergic reactions to oral care products, foods, or medicines; Dry mouth due to SjÃ¶gren syndrome; Infection from bacteria, yeast or viruses (including oral herpes); Injury (such as from burns, rough teeth, or bad-fitting dentures); Skin conditions that affect the mouth; Irritants such as tobacco, alcohol, hot foods, spices, or other irritants; Hormonal factors; Certain vitamin deficiencies"
001054,Labyrinthitis,Bacterial labyrinthitis; Serous labyrinthitis; Neuronitis - vestibular; Vestibular neuronitis; Viral neurolabyrinthitis; Vestibular neuritis; Labyrinthitis - vertigo: Labyrinthitis - dizziness; Labyrinthitis - vertigo; Labyrinthitis - hearing loss,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Feeling like you are spinning, even when you are still (vertigo).; Your eyes moving on their own, making it hard to focus them.; Dizziness.; Hearing loss in one ear.; Loss of balance -- you may fall toward one side.; Nausea and vomiting.; Ringing or other noises in your ears (tinnitus).","Labyrinthitis is usually caused by a virus and sometimes by bacteria. Having a cold or flu can trigger the condition. Less often, an ear infection may lead to labyrinthitis. Other causes include allergies or certain medicines that are bad for the inner ear.; Your inner ear is important for both hearing and balance. When you have labyrinthitis, the parts of your inner ear become irritated and swollen. This can make you lose your balance and cause hearing loss.; These factors raise your risk for labyrinthitis:; Drinking large amounts of alcohol; Fatigue; History of allergies; Recent viral illness, respiratory infection, or ear infection; Smoking; Stress; Using certain prescription or nonprescription medicines (such as aspirin)"
001055,Dental cavities,Caries; Tooth decay; Cavities - tooth,"There may be no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include:; Tooth pain or achy feeling, particularly after sweet or hot or cold foods and drinks; Visible pits or holes in the teeth","Tooth decay is a very common disorder. It most often occurs in children and young adults, but it can affect anyone. Tooth decay is a common cause of tooth loss in younger people.; Bacteria are normally found in your mouth. These bacteria change foods, especially sugar and starch, into acids. Bacteria, acid, food pieces, and saliva combine in the mouth to form a sticky substance called plaque. Plaque sticks to the teeth. It is most common on the back molars, just above the gum line on all teeth, and at the edges of fillings.; Plaque that is not removed from the teeth turns into a substance called tartar, or calculus. Plaque and tartar irritate the gums, resulting in gingivitis and periodontitis.; Plaque begins to build up on teeth within 20 minutes after eating. If it is not removed, it will harden and turn into tartar (calculus).; The acids in plaque damage the enamel covering your teeth. It also creates holes in the tooth called cavities. Cavities usually do not hurt, unless they grow very large and affect nerves or cause a tooth fracture. An untreated cavity can lead to an infection in the tooth called a tooth abscess. Untreated tooth decay also destroys the inside of the tooth (pulp). This requires more extensive treatment, or possibly removal of the tooth.; Carbohydrates (sugars and starches) increase the risk of tooth decay. Sticky foods are more harmful than non-sticky foods because they remain on the teeth. Frequent snacking increases the time that acids are in contact with the surface of the tooth."
001056,Gingivitis,Gum disease; Periodontal disease,"Symptoms of gingivitis include:; Bleeding gums (when brushing or flossing); Bright red or reddish-purple gums; Gums that are tender when touched, but otherwise painless; Mouth sores; Swollen gums; Shiny appearance to gums; Bad breath","Gingivitis is an early form of periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is inflammation and infection that destroys the tissues that support the teeth. This can include the gums, the periodontal ligaments, and bone.; Gingivitis is due to the short-term effects of plaque deposits on your teeth. Plaque is a sticky material made up of bacteria, mucus, and food debris that builds up on the teeth both above, and below the gums. It is also a major cause of tooth decay.; If you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar (or calculus) that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. An excess of bacteria in the mouth, and the toxins they produce cause the gums to become swollen, and tender. This is called an inflammatory response, which is part of the body's natural immune response to invading organisms.; These things raise your risk for gingivitis:; Many people have some amount of gingivitis. It often develops during puberty or early adulthood because of hormonal changes. It may last a long time or come back often, depending on the health of your teeth and gums.; Certain infections and body-wide (systemic) diseases; Poor dental hygiene; Pregnancy (hormonal changes increase the sensitivity of the gums); Uncontrolled diabetes; Smoking; Misaligned teeth, rough edges of fillings, and ill-fitting or unclean mouth appliances (such as braces, dentures, bridges, and crowns); Use of certain medicines, including phenytoin, bismuth, and some birth control pills"
001057,Impacted tooth,Tooth - unemerged; Unemerged tooth; Dental impaction; Unerupted tooth,There may be no symptoms of a fully impacted tooth. Symptoms of a partially impacted tooth may include:; Bad breath; Difficulty opening the mouth (occasionally); Pain or tenderness of the gums or jaw bone; Prolonged headache or jaw ache; Redness and swelling of the gums around the impacted tooth; Swollen lymph nodes of the neck (occasionally); Unpleasant taste when biting down on or near the area; Visible gap where a tooth did not emerge,"Teeth start to pass through the gums (emerge) during infancy. This happens again when permanent teeth replace the primary (baby) teeth.; If a tooth does not come in, or emerges only partially, it is considered to be impacted. This most commonly happens with the wisdom teeth (the third set of molars). They are the last teeth to erupt. They usually come in between the ages of 17 and 21.; An impacted tooth remains stuck in gum tissue or bone for various reasons. The area may be overcrowded, leaving no room for the teeth to emerge. For example, the jaw may be too small to fit the wisdom teeth. Teeth may also become twisted, tilted, or displaced as they try to emerge. This results in impacted teeth.; Impacted wisdom teeth are very common. They are often painless and do not cause problems. However, some professionals believe an impacted tooth pushes on the next tooth, which pushes the next tooth. Eventually, this can cause a misaligned bite. A partially emerged tooth can trap food, plaque, and other debris in the soft tissue around it, which can lead to inflammation and tenderness of the gums and unpleasant mouth odor. This is called pericoronitis. The retained debris may also lead to the decay on the wisdom tooth or the neighboring tooth, or even bone loss."
001058,Malocclusion of teeth,Crowded teeth; Misaligned teeth; Crossbite; Overbite; Underbite; Open bite,"Symptoms of malocclusion are:; Abnormal alignment of teeth; Abnormal appearance of the face; Difficulty or discomfort when biting or chewing; Speech difficulties (rare), including lisp; Mouth breathing (breathing through the mouth without closing the lips); Inability to bite into food correctly (open bite)","Occlusion refers to the alignment of teeth and the way that the upper and lower teeth fit together (bite). The upper teeth should fit slightly over the lower teeth. The points of the molars should fit the grooves of the opposite molar.; The upper teeth keep you from biting your cheeks and lips, and your lower teeth protect your tongue.; Malocclusion is most often hereditary. This means it is passed down through families. It may be caused by a difference between the size of the upper and lower jaws or between the jaw and tooth size. It causes tooth overcrowding or abnormal bite patterns. The shape of the jaws or birth defects such as cleft lip and palate may also be reasons for malocclusion.; Other causes include:; There are different categories of malocclusion:; Childhood habits such as thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifier use beyond age 3, and prolonged use of a bottle; Extra teeth, lost teeth, impacted teeth, or abnormally shaped teeth; Ill-fitting dental fillings, crowns, dental appliances, retainers, or braces; Misalignment of jaw fractures after a severe injury; Tumors of the mouth and jaw; Class 1 malocclusion is the most common. The bite is normal, but the upper teeth slightly overlap the lower teeth.; Class 2 malocclusion, called retrognathism or overbite, occurs when the upper jaw and teeth severely overlap the bottom jaw and teeth.; Class 3 malocclusion, called prognathism or underbite, occurs when the lower jaw protrudes or juts forward, causing the lower jaw and teeth to overlap the upper jaw and teeth."
001059,Periodontitis,Pyorrhea - gum disease; Inflammation of gums - involving bone,"Symptoms of periodontitis include:; Note: Early symptoms are similar to gingivitis (inflammation of the gums).; Bad breath odor (halitosis); Gums that are bright red or reddish-purple; Gums that look shiny; Gums that bleed easily (when flossing or brushing); Gums that are tender when touched but are painless otherwise; Gums that have receded; Loose teeth; Swollen gums; Gaps between the teeth and gums; Shifting teeth; Yellow, brown green or white hard deposits on your teeth; Tooth sensitivity","Periodontitis is a chronic infection of the gums that occurs when gum inflammation (gingivitis) is not treated. The infection worsens over time, causing breakdown and loss of the ligaments, soft tissues, and bone (supporting structures) of your teeth. This loss of support causes the teeth to become loose and eventually fall out. Periodontitis is the primary cause of tooth loss in adults. This disorder is uncommon in young children, but it increases during the teen years.; Plaque and tartar build up on the teeth. Inflammation results from this buildup and causes a normal âsulcusâ to deepen into an abnormal ""pocket,"" or gap between the gums and the teeth below the gum line. This pocket collects more plaque and transforms into a hard material called tartar. The bacteria in the plaque and tartar get trapped in the pockets and receive less oxygen. These anaerobes trigger the bodyâs inflammatory response, which leads to the natural destruction of the support for your teeth. Periodontal disease is a painless, chronic inflammatory disease, which if not treated, often leads to tooth mobility and tooth loss"
001060,Tooth abscess,Periapical abscess; Dental abscess; Tooth infection; Abscess - tooth; Dentoalveolar abscess; Odontogenic abscess,"The main symptom is a severe toothache. The pain is continuous. It does not stop. It can be described as gnawing, sharp, shooting, or throbbing.; Other symptoms may include:; Bitter taste in the mouth; Breath odor; General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill-feeling; Fever; Pain when chewing; Sensitivity of the teeth to hot or cold; Swelling of the gum over the infected tooth, which may look like a pimple; Swollen glands of the neck; Swollen area of the upper or lower jaw, which is a very serious symptom","A tooth abscess may form if there is tooth decay. It may also occur when a tooth is broken, chipped, or injured in other ways. Openings in the tooth enamel allow bacteria to infect the center of the tooth (the pulp). Infection may spread from the root of the tooth to the bones supporting the tooth.; Infection results in a buildup of pus and tissue swelling within the tooth. This causes a ""toothache"". The toothache may stop if pressure is relieved. But the infection will remain active and continue to spread. This will cause more pain and can destroy tissue."
001061,Acoustic trauma,Injury - inner ear; Trauma - inner ear; Ear injury,"Symptoms include:; Partial hearing loss that most often involves repeated long-term exposures to loud or high-pitched sounds. The hearing loss may slowly get worse.; Noises, ringing in the ear (tinnitus).",Acoustic trauma is a common cause of sensory hearing loss. Damage to the hearing mechanisms within the inner ear may be caused by:; Explosion near the ear; Firing a gun near the ear; Long-term exposure to loud noises (such as loud music or machinery); Any very loud noise near the ear

They may be caused by blunt force or be the result of a wound.; Common causes of injury to the face include:; Car and motorcycle crashes; Wounds; Sports injuries; Violence"
001063,Traumatic injury of the bladder and urethra,Injury - bladder and urethra; Bruised bladder; Urethral injury; Bladder injury; Pelvic fracture; Urethral disruption; Bladder perforation,"Some common symptoms are:; Shock or internal bleeding may occur after a bladder injury. This is a medical emergency. Symptoms include:; If there is no or little urine released, there may be an increased risk for urinary tract infections (UTI) or kidney damage.; Lower abdominal pain; Abdominal tenderness; Bruising at the site of injury; Blood in the urine; Bloody urethral discharge; Difficulty beginning to urinate or inability to empty the bladder; Leakage of urine; Painful urination; Pelvic pain; Small, weak urine stream; Abdominal distention or bloating; Decreased alertness, drowsiness, coma; Increased heart rate; Decrease in blood pressure; Pale skin; Sweating; Skin that is cool to the touch","Types of bladder injuries include:; The amount of injury to the bladder depends on:; Injury to the bladder due to trauma is not very common. The bladder is located within the bones of the pelvis. This protects it from most outside forces. Injury may occur if there is a blow to the pelvis severe enough to break the bones. In this case, bone fragments may pierce the bladder wall. Less than 1 in 10 pelvic fractures lead to bladder injury.; Other causes of bladder or urethra injury include:; Injury to the bladder or urethra may cause urine to leak into the abdomen. This may lead to infection.; Blunt trauma (such as a blow to the body); Penetrating wounds (such as bullet or stab wounds); How full the bladder was at the time of injury; What caused the injury; Surgeries of the pelvis or groin (such as hernia repair and removal of the uterus).; Tears, cuts, bruises, and other injuries to the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body. This is more common in men than women.; Straddle injuries. This injury may occur if there is direct force that injures the area behind the scrotum.; Deceleration injury. This injury may occur during a motor vehicle accident. Your bladder can get injured if it is full and you are wearing a seatbelt."
001064,Ear barotrauma,Barotitis media; Barotrauma; Ear popping - barotrauma; Pressure-related ear pain; Eustachian tube dysfunction - barotrauma; Barotitis; Ear squeeze,"Common symptoms include:; Other symptoms may develop if the condition is very bad or goes on for a long time, such as:; Dizziness; Ear discomfort or pain in one or both ears; Hearing loss (slight); Sensation of fullness or stuffiness in the ears; Ear pain; Feeling of pressure in the ears (as if underwater); Moderate to severe hearing loss; Nosebleed","The air pressure in the middle ear is most often the same as the air pressure outside of the body. The eustachian tube is a connection between the middle ear and the back of the nose and upper throat.; Swallowing or yawning opens the eustachian tube and allows air to flow into or out of the middle ear. This helps equalize pressure on either side of the ear drum. If the eustachian tube is blocked, the air pressure in the middle ear is different than the pressure on the outside of the eardrum. This can cause barotrauma.; Many people have barotrauma at some time. The problem often occurs with altitude changes, such as flying, scuba diving, or driving in the mountains. If you have a congested nose from allergies, colds, or an upper respiratory infection, you are more likely to develop barotrauma.; Blockage of the eustachian tube could also be present before birth (congenital). It may also be caused by swelling in the throat."
001065,Injury - kidney and ureter,Kidney damage; Toxic injury of the kidney; Kidney injury; Traumatic injury of the kidney; Fractured kidney; Inflammatory injury of the kidney; Bruised kidney; Ureteral injury; Pre-renal failure - injury; Post-renal failure - injury; Kidney obstruction - injury,"Emergency symptoms may include:; Long-term (chronic) symptoms may include:; If only one kidney is affected and the other kidney is healthy, you may not have any symptoms.; Abdominal pain and swelling; Severe flank pain and back pain; Blood in the urine; Drowsiness, decreased alertness, including coma; Decreased urine output or inability to urinate; Fever; Increased heart rate; Nausea, vomiting; Skin that is pale or cool to touch; Sweating; Malnutrition; High blood pressure; Kidney failure","The kidneys are located in the flank at either side of the spine. The flank is the back of the upper abdomen. They are protected by the spine, lower rib cage, and strong muscles of the back. This location protects the kidneys from many outside forces. The kidneys are also surrounded by a layer of fat. The fat helps to cushion them.; The kidneys have a large blood supply. Any injury to them, can lead to severe bleeding. The many layers of padding help prevent kidney injury.; Kidneys may be injured by damage to the blood vessels that supply or drain them, including:; Kidney injuries may also be caused by:; The ureters are the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Ureteral injuries may be caused by:; Aneurysm; Arterial blockage; Arteriovenous fistula; Renal vein thrombosis (clotting); Trauma; Angiomyolipoma, a noncancerous tumor, if the tumor is very large; Autoimmune disorders; Bladder outlet obstruction; Cancer of the kidney, pelvic organs (ovaries or uterus in women), or colon; Diabetes; Buildup of body waste products such as uric acid (which can occur with gout or treatment of bone marrow, lymph node, or other disorders); Exposure to toxic substances such as lead, cleaning products, solvents, fuels, certain antibiotics, or long-term use of pain medicines (analgesic nephropathy); High blood pressure and other medical conditions that affect the kidneys; Inflammation caused by immune responses to medicines, infection, or other disorders; Medical procedures such as kidney biopsy, or nephrostomy tube placement; Ureteropelvic junction obstruction; Ureteral obstruction; Kidney stones; Complications from medical procedures; Diseases such as retroperitoneal fibrosis, retroperitoneal sarcomas, or cancers that spread to the lymph nodes near the ureters; Kidney stones; Radiation to the belly area; Trauma"
001066,Spinal cord trauma,Spinal cord injury; Compression of spinal cord; SCI; Cord compression,"Symptoms vary, depending on the location of the injury. SCI causes weakness and loss of feeling at, and below the injury. The severity of the symptoms depends on whether the entire cord is injured (complete) or only partially injured (incomplete). An injury to the upper (cervical) spinal cord will result in weakness or paralysis of the arms and legs. An injury to the middle (thoracic) spinal cord will result in weakness of the legs only.; An injury below the first lumbar vertebra does not cause SCI because the spinal cord turns into a group of nerve roots called the cauda equina. But such an injury may cause cauda equina syndrome, which is an injury to these nerve roots. Many SCIs and cauda equina syndrome cases are emergencies and need surgery right away.; Injuries of the spinal cord at any level may cause:; CERVICAL (NECK) INJURIES; When SCIs are in the neck area, symptoms can affect the arms, legs, and middle of the body. The symptoms:; THORACIC (CHEST LEVEL) INJURIES; When SCIs are at chest level, symptoms can affect the legs. Injuries to the cervical or high thoracic spinal cord may also result in:; LUMBAR OR SACRAL (LOWER BACK) INJURIES; When SCIs are at the lower back level, symptoms can affect one or both legs. Muscles that control the bowels and bladder can also be affected. Spine injuries can damage the spinal cord if they are at the upper portion of the lumbar spine or the lumbar and sacral nerve roots (cauda equina) if they are at the lower lumbar spine.; Increased muscle tone (spasticity); Loss of normal bowel and bladder control (may include constipation, incontinence, bladder spasms); Numbness; Sensory changes; Pain; Weakness, paralysis; Difficulty breathing because of weakness of the abdominal, diaphragm, or intercostal (rib) muscles; May occur on one or both sides of the body; Can include severe breathing problems from paralysis of the breathing muscles if the injury is high up in the neck; Blood pressure problems (too high and too low); Abnormal sweating; Trouble maintaining normal temperature","The spinal cord contains nerve fibers and cells. These nerve fibers carry messages between your brain and body. The spinal cord is located in the spinal canal of your spine in your neck, chest, and back down to the first lumbar vertebra.; Spinal cord injury (SCI) can be caused by any of the following:; A minor injury can damage the spinal cord. Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, infection, cancer, or osteoporosis can weaken the spine, which normally protects the spinal cord. Injury can also occur if the spinal canal protecting the spinal cord has become too narrow (spinal stenosis). This occurs due to osteoarthritis of spine joints, usually in older people.; Direct injury or damage to the spinal cord can occur due to:; Bleeding, fluid buildup, infection, and swelling can occur inside the spinal canal. This can press on the spinal cord and damage it.; Most high impact SCIs, such as from MVCs or sports injuries, are seen in healthy people.; Most low impact SCIs, such as a slip and fall, occur in older individuals with spinal stenosis. Most of these people were not aware they had spinal stenosis.; Risk factors include:; Assault; Falls; Gunshot wounds; Industrial accidents; Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs); Diving; Sports injuries; Bruises if the bones have been weakened, loosened, or fractured; Disc herniation (when the disc pushes against the spinal cord); Fragments of bone (such as from broken vertebrae, which are the spine bones) in the spinal cord; Fragments of metal (such as from a motor vehicle collision or gunshot); Compression from twisting of the head, neck or back during an accident such as a slip and fall, or intense chiropractic manipulation; Tight spinal canal (spinal stenosis) that squeezes the spinal cord; When the spine is out of alignment; Participating in risky physical activities; Riding in or on high-speed vehicles; Diving into shallow water"
001068,CSF leak,Intracranial hypotension; Cerebrospinal fluid leak,"Symptoms may include:; A headache that is worse when you sit up and improves when you lie down. It may be associated with light sensitivity, nausea, and neck stiffness.; Drainage of CSF from the ear (rarely).; Drainage of CSF from the nose (rarely).","Any tear or hole in the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (dura) can allow the fluid that surrounds those organs to leak. When it leaks out, the pressure around the brain and spinal cord drops.; Causes of leakage through the dura include:; Sometimes, no cause can be found. This is called a spontaneous CSF leak.; Certain head, brain, or spinal surgeries; Head or spine injury; Placement of tubes for epidural anesthesia or pain medicines; Spinal tap (lumbar puncture)"
001069,Basal ganglia dysfunction,Extrapyramidal syndrome; Antipsychotics - extrapyramidal,"Damage to the basal ganglia cells may cause problems controlling speech, movement, and posture. This combination of symptoms is called parkinsonism.; A person with basal ganglia dysfunction may have trouble starting, stopping, or sustaining movement. Depending on which area of the brain is affected, there may also be problems with memory and other thought processes.; In general, symptoms vary and may include:; Movement changes, such as involuntary or slowed movements; Increased muscle tone; Muscle spasms and muscle rigidity; Problems finding words; Tremor; Uncontrollable, repeated movements, speech, or cries (tics); Walking difficulty","Any condition that can cause brain injury can damage the basal ganglia. Such conditions include:; A common cause of the symptoms of basal ganglia dysfunction is chronic use of medicines called antipsychotics, used to treat schizophrenia.; Many brain disorders are associated with basal ganglia dysfunction. They include:; Carbon monoxide poisoning; Medicine or illegal drug overdose; Head injury; Infection; Liver disease; Metabolic problems; Multiple sclerosis (MS); Poisoning with copper, manganese, or other heavy metals; Stroke; Tumors; Dystonia (muscle tone problems); Huntington disease (nerve cells in certain parts of the brain waste away, or degenerate); Multiple system atrophy (widespread nervous system disorder); Parkinson disease; Progressive supranuclear palsy (movement disorder from damage to certain nerve cells in the brain); Wilson disease (disorder causing too much copper in the body's tissues)"
001070,Kneecap dislocation,Dislocation - kneecap; Patellar dislocation or instability,"Symptoms of kneecap dislocation include:; The first few times this occurs, you will feel pain and may be unable to walk. If you continue to have dislocations, your knee may not hurt as much and you may not be as disabled. This is not a reason to avoid treatment. Kneecap dislocation damages your knee joint. It can lead to cartilage injuries and increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis at a younger age. Repeat dislocations will make the condition worse and harder to treat.; Knee appears to be deformed; Knee is bent and cannot be straightened out; Kneecap (patella) dislocates to the outside of the knee; Knee pain and tenderness; Knee swelling; ""Sloppy"" kneecap -- you can move the kneecap too much from right to left (hypermobile patella)","Kneecap dislocation often occurs after a sudden change in direction when your leg is planted. This puts your kneecap under stress. This can occur when playing certain sports, such as basketball.; Dislocation may also occur as result of direct trauma. When the kneecap is dislocated, it can slip sideways to the outside of the knee."
001072,Achilles tendinitis,Tendinitis of the heel; Heel pain - Achilles,Symptoms include pain in the heel and along the length of the tendon when walking or running. The area may feel painful and stiff in the morning.; The tendon may be painful to touch or move. The area may be swollen and warm. You may have trouble standing up on your toes. You may also have trouble finding shoes that fit comfortably due to pain in the back of your heel.,"There are two large muscles in the calf. These create the power needed to push off with the foot or go up on the toes. The large Achilles tendon connects these muscles to the heel.; Heel pain is most often due to overuse of the foot. Rarely, it is caused by an injury.; Tendinitis due to overuse is most common in younger people. It can occur in walkers, runners, or other athletes.; Achilles tendinitis may be more likely to occur if:; Tendinitis from arthritis is more common in middle-aged and older adults. A bone spur or growth may form in the back of the heel bone. This may irritate the Achilles tendon and cause pain and swelling. Flat feet will put more tension on the tendon.; There is a sudden increase in the amount or intensity of an activity.; Your calf muscles are very tight (not stretched out).; You run on hard surfaces, such as concrete.; You run too often.; You jump a lot (such as when playing basketball).; You do not wear shoes that give your feet proper support.; Your foot suddenly turns in or out."
001073,Bursitis of the heel,Insertional heel pain; Retrocalcaneal bursitis,"Symptoms include:; Pain at the back of the heel, especially with walking, running, or when the area is touched; Pain may get worse when standing on tiptoes; Red, warm skin over the back of the heel","A bursa acts as a cushion and lubricant between tendons or muscles sliding over bone. There are bursas around most large joints in the body, including the ankle.; The retrocalcaneal bursa is located in the back of the ankle by the heel. It is under the large Achilles tendon that connects the calf muscles to the heel bone.; Repeated or too much use of the ankle can cause this bursa to become irritated and inflamed. It may be caused by too much walking, running, or jumping.; This condition is very often linked to Achilles tendinitis. Sometimes retrocalcaneal bursitis may be mistaken for Achilles tendinitis.; Risks for this condition include:; Starting a very intense workout schedule; Suddenly increasing activity level without the right conditioning; Increase or decrease in activity level; History of arthritis that is caused by inflammation"
001074,Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury,Cruciate ligament injury - anterior; ACL tear; Knee injury - anterior cruciate ligament (ACL),"Early symptoms:; Those who have only a mild injury may notice that the knee feels unstable or seems to ""give way"" when using it.; A ""popping"" sound at the time of injury; ObviousÂ knee swelling within 6 hours of injury; Pain, especially when you try to put weight on the injured leg; Difficulty in continuing with your sport; Feeling of instability","An ACL injury can occur if you:; Basketball, football, soccer, and skiing are common sports linked to ACL tears.; ACL injuries often occur with other injuries. For example, an ACL tear often occurs along with tears to the MCL and the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee (meniscus).; Most ACL tears occur in the middle of the ligament, or the ligament is pulled off the thigh bone. These injuries form a gap between the torn edges, and do not heal on their own.; Get hit very hard on the side of your knee, such as during a football tackle; Overextend your knee joint; Quickly stop moving and change direction while running, landing from a jump, or turning"
001082,Histoplasmosis,Fungal infection - histoplasmosis; Ohio River Valley fever; Fibrosing mediastinitis,"Most people have no symptoms, or only have a mild, flu-like illness.; If symptoms do occur, they may include:; The infection may be active for a short period of time, and then the symptoms go away. Sometimes, the lung infection may become chronic. Symptoms include:; In a small number of people, especially in those with a weakened immune system, histoplasmosis spreads throughout the body. This is called disseminated histoplasmosis. In response to the infection irritation and swelling (inflammation) occur. Symptoms may include:; Fever and chills; Cough and chest pain that gets worse when breathing in; Joint pain; Mouth sores; Red skin bumps, most often on the lower legs; Chest pain and shortness of breath; Cough, possibly coughing up blood; Fever and sweating; Chest pain from inflammation of the sac-like covering around the heart (pericarditis); Headache and neck stiffness from swelling of the membranes covering of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis); High fever","Histoplasmosis occurs throughout the world. In the United States, it is most common in the southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and central states, especially in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.; Histoplasma fungus grows as a mold in the soil. You may get sick when you breathe in spores produced by the fungus. Soil that contains bird or bat droppings may have larger amounts of this fungus. The threat is greatest after an old building is torn down, or in caves.; This infection can occur in people with a healthy immune system. But, having a weakened immune system increases the risk of getting or reactivating this disease. Very young or very old people, or those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or an organ transplant have more severe symptoms.; People withÂ long-term (chronic) lung disease (such as emphysema and bronchiectasis) are also at higher risk for a more severe infection."

Symptoms may include:; Breathing noises that may change with position and improve during sleep; Breathing problems that get worse with coughing, crying, feeding, or upper respiratory infections (such as cold); High-pitched breathing; Rattling or noisy breaths","Tracheomalacia in a newborn occurs when the cartilage in the windpipe has not developed properly. Instead of being rigid, the walls of the trachea are floppy. Because the windpipe is the main airway, breathing problems begin soon after birth.; Congenital tracheomalacia is very uncommon."
001085,Paraquat poisoning,Paraquat lung,"Symptoms of paraquat poisoning include:; Burns and pain in the throat; Choking; Coma (lack of responsiveness); Difficulty breathing; Nosebleed; Seizures; Shock (extremely low blood pressure); Shortness of breath; Stomach pain; Vomiting, including vomiting blood","In the United States, paraquat is classified as ""restricted commercial use."" People must obtain a license to use the product.; Breathing in paraquat may cause lung damage and can lead to a disease called paraquat lung. Paraquat causes damage to the body when it touches the lining of the mouth, stomach, or intestines. You can get sick if paraquat touches a cut on your skin. Paraquat may also damage the kidneys, liver, and esophagus (the tube that food goes down from your mouth to your stomach).; If paraquat is swallowed, death can quickly occur. Death may occur from a hole in the esophagus, or from severe inflammation of the area that surrounds the major blood vessels and airways in the middle of the chest (mediastinum).; Long-term exposure to paraquat may cause scarring of the lungs called pulmonary fibrosis. This makes it hard to breathe."
001086,Mediastinal tumor,Thymoma - mediastinal; Lymphoma - mediastinal,Almost one half of mediastinal tumors cause no symptoms and are found on a chest x-ray done for another reason. Symptoms that do occur are due to pressure on (compression of) local structures and may include:; Chest pain; Fever and chills; Cough; Coughing up blood (hemoptysis); Hoarseness; Night sweats; Shortness of breath,"The mediastinum is the part of the chest that lies between the sternum and the spinal column, and between the lungs. This area contains the heart, large blood vessels, windpipe (trachea), thymus gland, esophagus, and connective tissues. The mediastinum is divided into three sections:; Mediastinal tumors are rare.; The most common location for tumors in the mediastinum depends on the age of the person. In children, tumors are more common in the posterior mediastinum. These tumors often begin in the nerves and are noncancerous (benign).; Most mediastinal tumors in adults occur in the anterior mediastinum. They are usually cancerous (malignant) lymphomas, germ cell tumors, or thymomas (cancers of the thymus). These tumors are most common in middle aged and older adults.; Anterior (front); Middle; Posterior (back)"
001087,Acute bronchitis,,"Some symptoms of acute bronchitis are:; Even after acute bronchitis has cleared, you may have a dry, nagging cough that lasts for 1 to 4 weeks.; Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have pneumonia or bronchitis. If you have pneumonia, you are more likely to have a high fever and chills, feel sicker, or feel more short of breath.; Chest discomfort; Cough that produces mucus -- the mucus may be clear or yellow-green; Fatigue; Fever -- usually low-grade; Shortness of breath that gets worse with activity; Wheezing, in people with asthma","When acute bronchitis occurs, it almost always comes after having a cold or flu-like illness. The bronchitis infection is usually caused by a virus. At first, it affects your nose, sinuses, and throat. Then it spreads to the airways that lead to your lungs.; Sometimes, bacteria also infect your airways. This is more common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).; Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition. To be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, you must have a cough with mucus on most days for at least 3 months."

001089,Byssinosis,Cotton worker's lung; Cotton bract disease; Mill fever; Brown lung disease; Monday fever,Symptoms may include any of the following:; Symptoms are worse at the beginning of the work week and improve later in the week. Symptoms are also less severe when the person is away from the workplace.; Chest tightness; Cough; Wheezing; Shortness of breath,Inhaling the dust produced by raw cotton can cause byssinosis. It is most common in people who work in the textile industry.; Those who are sensitive to the dust can have an asthma-like condition after being exposed.; Methods of prevention in the United States have reduced the number of cases. Byssinosis is still common in developing countries. Smoking increases riskÂ of developing this disease. Being exposed to the dust many times can lead toÂ long-term (chronic) lung disease.
001090,Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula,Arteriovenous malformation - pulmonary,"Many people have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include:; Bloody sputum; Difficulty breathing; Difficulty exercising; Nosebleeds; Shortness of breath with exertion; Chest painÂ; Blue skin (cyanosis); Clubbing of the fingers","Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas are usually the result of abnormal development of the blood vessels of the lung. Most occur in people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). These people often have abnormal blood vessels in many other parts of the body.; Fistulas also can be a complication of liver disease or lung injury, although these causes are much less common."
001091,Pulmonary atresia,Pulmonary atresia - intact ventricular septum; PA/IVS; Congenital heart disease - pulmonary atresia; Cyanotic heart disease - pulmonary atresia; Valve - disorder pulmonary atresia,"Symptoms most often occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days.; Symptoms may include:; Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood; Fast breathing; Fatigue; Poor eating habits (babies may get tired while nursing or sweat during feedings); Shortness of breath","As with most congenital heart diseases, there is no known cause of pulmonary atresia. The condition is linked with another type of congenital heart defect called a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).; Pulmonary atresia may occur with or without a ventricular septal defect (VSD).; Although both conditions are called pulmonary atresia, they are, in fact, different defects. This article discusses pulmonary atresia without a VSD.; People with PA/IVS may also have a poorly developed tricuspid valve. They may also have an underdeveloped or very thick right ventricle, and abnormal blood vessels feeding the heart. Less commonly, structures in the left ventricle, aortic valve, and right atrium are involved.; If the person does not have a VSD, the condition is called pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS).; If the person has both problems, the condition is called pulmonary atresia with VSD. This is an extreme form of tetralogy of Fallot."
001092,Tracheal rupture,Torn tracheal mucosa; Bronchial rupture,"People with trauma who develop a tracheal or bronchial rupture often have other injuries.; Symptoms may include:; Coughing up blood; Bubbles of air that can be felt underneath the skin of the chest, neck, arms, and trunk (subcutaneous emphysema); Difficulty breathing","The injury may be caused by:; Injuries to the trachea or bronchi also may occur during medical procedures (for example,Â bronchoscopy and placement of a breathing tube).

They often occur in pregnant women and in people with liver disease. They can appear in both children and adults. They get their name because the mark looks similar to a red spider.; They appear most often on the face, neck, upper part of the trunk, arms, and fingers."
001096,Pulmonic valve stenosis,Valvular pulmonary stenosis; Heart valve pulmonary stenosis; Pulmonary stenosis; Stenosis - pulmonary valve; Balloon valvuloplasty - pulmonary,"Many cases of pulmonic stenosis are mild and do not cause symptoms. The problem is most often found in infants when a heart murmur is heard during a routine heart exam.; When the valve narrowing (stenosis) is moderate to severe, the symptoms include:; Symptoms may get worse with exercise or activity.; Abdominal distention; Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) in some people; Poor appetite; Chest pain; Fainting; Fatigue; Poor weight gain or failure to thrive in infants with a severe blockage; Shortness of breath; Sudden death","Narrowing of the pulmonary valve is most often present at birth (congenital). It is caused by a problem that occurs as the baby develops in the womb before birth. The cause is unknown, but genes may play a role.; Narrowing that occurs in the valve itself is called valvular pulmonic stenosis. There may also be narrowing just before or after the valve.; The defect may occur alone or with other heart defects that are present at birth. The condition can be mild or severe.; Pulmonic stenosis is a rare disorder. In some cases, the problem runs in families."
001097,SVC obstruction,Superior vena cava obstruction; Superior vena cava syndrome,"Symptoms occur when something blocks the blood flowing back to the heart. Symptoms may begin suddenly or gradually, and may worsen when you bend over or lie down.; Early signs include:; The swelling may be worse or more prominent when lying down than when upright. It may be worse in the early morning hours and may go away by mid-morning.; The most common symptoms are shortness of breath (dyspnea) and swelling of the face, neck, trunk, and arms.; Other possible symptoms include:; Swelling around the eye; Swelling of the face; Swelling of the whites of the eyes; Distended veins in the neck; Decreased alertness; Dizziness, fainting; Headache; Reddish face or cheeks; Reddish palms; Reddish mucous membranes (inside the nose, mouth, and other places); Redness changing to blueness later; Sensation of head or ear fullness; Vision changes",SVC obstruction is a rare condition.; It is most often caused by cancer or a tumor in the mediastinum (the area of the chest under the breastbone and between the lungs).; Other types of cancer that can lead to this condition include:; SVC obstruction can also be caused by noncancerous conditions that cause scarring. These conditions include:; Other causes of SVC obstruction include:; Catheters placed in the large veins of the upper arm and neck may cause blood clots in the SVC.; Breast cancer; Lymphoma; Metastatic lung cancer (lung cancer that spreads); Testicular cancer; Thyroid cancer; Thymus tumor; Histoplasmosis (a type of fungal infection); Inflammation of a vein (thrombophlebitis); Lung infections (such as tuberculosis); Aortic aneurysm (a widening of the artery that leaves the heart); Blood clots in the SVC; Constrictive pericarditis (tightening of the thin lining of the heart); Effects of radiation therapy for certain medical conditions; Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter)
001098,Endocarditis,Valve infection; Staphylococcus aureus - endocarditis; Enterococcus - endocarditis; Streptococcus viridans - endocarditis; Candida - endocarditis,"Symptoms of endocarditis may develop slowly or suddenly.; Fever, chills, and sweating are frequent symptoms. These sometimes can:; You may also have fatigue, weakness, weight loss, loss of appetite, and aches and pains in the muscles or joints.; Other signs can include:; Be present for days before any other symptoms appear; Come and go, or be more noticeable at nighttime; Small areas of bleeding under the nails (splinter hemorrhages); Red, painless skin spots on the palms and soles (Janeway lesions); Red, painful nodes in the pads of the fingers and toes (Osler nodes); Shortness of breath with activity; Swelling of feet, legs, abdomen","Endocarditis can involve the heart muscle, heart valves, or lining of the heart.

001099,Ventricular septal defect,VSD; Interventricular septal defect; Congenital heart defect - VSD,"People with VSDs may not have symptoms. However, if the hole is large, the baby often has symptoms related to heart failure.; The most common symptoms include:; Shortness of breath; Fast breathing; Hard breathing; Paleness; Failure to gain weight; Fast heart rate; Sweating while feeding; Frequent respiratory infections","Before a baby is born, the right and left ventricles of the heart are not separate. As the fetus grows, a septum (wall) forms to separate these 2 ventricles. If the wall does not completely form, a hole remains. This hole is known as a ventricular septal defect, or a VSD. The hole can occur in different locations along the septal wall. There can be a single hole or multiple holes.; Ventricular septal defect is a common congenital heart defect. The baby may have no symptoms and the hole can close over time as the wall continues to grow after birth. If the hole is large, too much blood will be pumped to the lungs. This can lead to heart failure. If the hole is small, it may not be detected for years and only discovered in adulthood.; The cause of VSD is not yet known. This defect often occurs along with other congenital heart defects.; In adults, VSDs can be rare, but serious, complication of heart attacks. These holes do not result from a birth defect."
001100,Ectopic heartbeat,PVB (premature ventricular beat); Premature beats; PVC (premature ventricular complex/contraction); Extrasystole; Premature supraventricular contractions; PAC; Premature atrial contraction; Abnormal heartbeat,"Symptoms include:; Note: There may be no symptoms.; Feeling your heartbeat (palpitations); Feeling like your heart stopped or skipped a beat; Feeling of occasional, forceful beats","Ectopic heartbeats are sometimes seen with:; Ectopic beats may be caused or made worse by smoking, alcohol use, caffeine, stimulant medicines, and some street drugs.; Ectopic heartbeats are rare in children without heart disease that was present at birth (congenital). Most extra heartbeats in children are PACs. These are often benign.; In adults, ectopic heartbeats are common. They are most often due to PACs or PVCs. Your health care provider should look into the cause when they are frequent. Treatment is directed at symptoms and the underlying cause.; Changes in the blood, such as a low potassium level (hypokalemia); Decrease in blood supply to the heart; When the heart is enlarged or structurally abnormal"
001101,Arrhythmias,Abnormal heart rhythms; Bradycardia; Tachycardia; Fibrillation,"When you have an arrhythmia, your heartbeat may be:; An arrhythmia may be present all of the time or it may come and go. You may or may not feel symptoms when the arrhythmia is present. Or, you may only notice symptoms when you are more active.; Symptoms can be very mild, or they may be severe or even life threatening.; Common symptoms that may occur when the arrhythmia is present could include:; Too slow (bradycardia); Too quick (tachycardia); Irregular, uneven, possibly with extra or skipped beats; Chest pain; Fainting; Lightheadedness, dizziness; Paleness; Palpitations (feeling your heart beat fast or irregularly); Shortness of breath; Sweating","Normally, your heart works as a pump that brings blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.; To help this happen, your heart has an electrical system that makes sure it contracts (squeezes) in an orderly way.; Arrhythmias are caused by problems with the heart's electrical conduction system.; Some common causes of abnormal heartbeats are:; Arrhythmias may also be caused by some substances or drugs, including:; Some of the more common abnormal heart rhythms are:; The electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in an area of the heart called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). This is your heart's natural pacemaker.; The signal leaves the SA node and travels through the heart along a set electrical pathway.; Different nerve messages signal your heart to beat slower or faster.; Abnormal extra signals may occur.; Electrical signals may be blocked or slowed.; Electrical signals travel in new or different pathways through the heart.; Abnormal levels of potassium, magnesium, or other substances in the body; Heart attack, or a damaged heart muscle from a past heart attack; Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital); Heart failure or an enlarged heart; Overactive thyroid gland; Alcohol or stimulant drugs; Certain medicines; Cigarette smoking (nicotine); Atrial fibrillation or flutter; Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT); Heart block or atrioventricular block; Multifocal atrial tachycardia; Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; Sick sinus syndrome; Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia; Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome"
001102,Arterial embolism,,You may not have any symptoms.; Symptoms may begin quickly or slowly depending on the size of the embolus and how much it blocks the blood flow.; Symptoms of an arterial embolism in the arms or legs may include:; Later symptoms:; Symptoms of a clot in an organ vary with the organ involved but may include:; Cold arm or leg; Decreased or no pulse in an arm or leg; Lack of movement in the arm or leg; Pain in the affected area; Numbness and tingling in the arm or leg; Pale color of the arm or leg (pallor); Weakness of an arm or leg; Blisters of the skin fed by the affected artery; Shedding (sloughing) of skin; Skin erosion (ulcer); Tissue death (necrosis; skin is dark and damaged); Pain in the part of the body that is involved; Temporarily decreased organ function,"An ""embolus"" is a blood clot or a piece of atherosclerotic plaque that acts like a clot. The word ""emboli"" means there is more than one clot or piece of plaque. When the clot travels from the site where it formed to another location in the body, it is called an embolism.; An arterial embolism may be caused by one or more clots. The clots can get stuck in an artery and block blood flow. The blockage starves tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death (necrosis).; Arterial emboli often occur in the legs and feet. Emboli that occur in the brain cause a stroke. Ones that occur in the heart cause a heart attack. Other sites include the kidneys, intestines, and eyes.; Risk factors for arterial embolism include:; Another condition that poses a high risk for embolization (especially to the brain) is mitral stenosis. Endocarditis (infection of the inside of the heart) can also cause arterial emboli.; A common source for an embolus is from areas of hardening (atherosclerosis causing plaque) in the aorta and other large blood vessels. These clots can break loose and flow down to the abdominal organs, legs and feet.; Paradoxical embolization can take place when a clot in a vein enters the right side of the heart and passes through a hole into the left side of the heart. The clot can then move to an artery and block blood flow to the brain (stroke) or other organs.; If a clot travels and lodges in the arteries supplying blood flow to the lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus.; Abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation; Injury or damage to an artery wall; Conditions that increase blood clotting"
001103,Pericarditis - constrictive,Constrictive pericarditis,"When you have constrictive pericarditis, the inflammation causes the covering of the heart to become thick and rigid. This makes it hard for the heart to expand properly when it beats. As a result, the heart chambers don't fill up with enough blood. Blood backs up behind the heart, causing heart swelling and other symptoms of heart failure.; Symptoms of chronic constrictive pericarditis include:; Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) that develops slowly and gets worse; Fatigue; Long-term swelling (edema) of the legs and ankles; Swollen abdomen; Weakness","Most of the time, constrictive pericarditis occurs due to things that cause inflammation to develop around the heart, such as:; Less common causes include:; The condition may also develop without a clear cause.; It is rare in children.; Heart surgery; Radiation therapy to the chest; Tuberculosis; Abnormal fluid buildup in the covering of the heart. This may occur because of infection or as a complication of surgery.; Mesothelioma"
001104,Cyanotic heart disease,Right-to-left cardiac shunt; Right-to-left circulatory shunt,"Some heart defects cause major problems right after birth.; The main symptom of cyanosis is a bluish color of the lips, fingers, and toes that is caused by the low oxygen content in the blood. It may occur while the child is resting or only when the child is active.; Some children have breathing problems (dyspnea). They may get into a squatting position after physical activity to relieve breathlessness.; Others have spells, in which their bodies are suddenly starved of oxygen. During these spells, symptoms may include:; Infants may get tired or sweat while feeding and may not gain as much weight as they should.; Fainting (syncope) and chest pain may occur.; Other symptoms depend on the type of cyanotic heart disease, and may include:; Anxiety; Breathing too quickly (hyperventilation); Sudden increase in bluish color to the skin; Feeding problems or reduced appetite, leading to poor growth; Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood; Puffy eyes or face; Tiredness all the time","Normally, blood returns from the body and flows through the heart and lungs.; Heart defects that children are born with can change the way blood flows through the heart and lungs. These defects can cause less blood to flow to the lungs. They can also result in blue and red blood mixing together. This causes poorly oxygenated blood to be pumped out to the body. As a result:; Some of these heart defects involve the heart valves. These defects force blue blood to mix with red blood through abnormal heart channels. Heart valves are found between the heart and the large blood vessels that bring blood to and from the heart. These valves open up enough for blood to flow through. Then they close, keeping blood from flowing backward.; Heart valve defects that can cause cyanosis include:; Other heart defects may include abnormalities in valve development or in the location and connections between blood vessels. Some examples include:; Certain medical conditions in the mother can increase the risk of certain cyanotic heart diseases in the infant. Some examples include:; Blood that is low in oxygen returns from the body to the right side of the heart.; The right side of the heart then pumps the blood to the lungs, where it picks up more oxygen and becomes red.; The oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the left side of the heart. From there, it is pumped to the rest of the body.; The blood that is pumped out to the body is lower in oxygen.; Less oxygen delivered to the body can make the skin look blue (cyanosis).; Tricuspid valve (the valve between the 2 chambers on the right side of the heart) may be absent or unable to open wide enough.; Pulmonary valve (the valve between the heart and the lungs) may be absent or unable to open wide enough.; Aortic valve (the valve between the heart and the blood vessel to the rest of the body) is unable to open wide enough.; Mitral valve (the valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of the heart) may be absent or unable to open wide enough. This is very rare and a poorly formed left ventricle may also be present.; Coarctation or complete interruption of the aorta; Ebstein anomaly; Hypoplastic left heart syndrome; Tetralogy of Fallot; Total anomalous pulmonary venous return; Transposition of the great arteries; Truncus arteriosus; Chemical exposure; Genetic and chromosomal syndromes, such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Noonan syndrome; Infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy; Poorly controlled blood sugar level in women who have diabetes during pregnancy; Medicines prescribed by your health care provider or bought on your own and used during pregnancy; Street drugs used during pregnancy"
001105,Cardiomyopathy,,,"There are many types of cardiomyopathy, with different causes. Some of the more common ones are:; Dilated cardiomyopathy (also called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy if there is no known cause) is a condition in which the heart becomes weak and the chambers get large. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood out to the body. It can be caused by many medical problems.; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. This makes it harder for blood to leave the heart. This type of cardiomyopathy is most often passed down through families.; Ischemic cardiomyopathy is caused by a narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart with blood. It makes the heart walls thin so they do not pump well.; Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a group of disorders. The heart chambers are unable to fill with blood because the heart muscle is stiff. The most common causes of this type of cardiomyopathy are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause.; Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs during pregnancy or in the first 5 months afterward."
001106,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,HLHS; Congenital heart - hypoplastic left heart; Cyanotic heart disease - hypoplastic left heart,"At first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may appear normal. Symptoms may occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:; In healthy newborns, bluish color in the hands and feet is a response to cold (this reaction is called peripheral cyanosis).; A bluish color in the chest or abdomen, lips, and tongue is abnormal (called central cyanosis). It is a sign that there is not enough oxygen in the blood. Central cyanosis often increases with crying.; Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood; Cold hands and feet (extremities); Lethargy; Poor pulse; Poor suckling and feeding; Pounding heart; Rapid breathing; Shortness of breath","Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females.; As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10% of babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects. It is also associated with some genetic diseases such as Turner syndrome, Jacobsen syndrome, trisomy 13 and 18.; The problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:; This causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.; In babies with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for a while, but this extra workload eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.; The only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and the left side of the heart, or between the arteries and pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two of these connections:; Both connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.; In babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood leaving the right side of the heart through the pulmonary artery travels through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. If the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the baby may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body. Babies with known hypoplastic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosus open.; Because there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood returning to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Babies with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).; Aorta (the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body); Entrance and exit of the ventricle; Mitral and aortic valves; Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium); Ductus arteriosus (a small blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)"

001108,Thrombophlebitis,Phlebitis; Deep vein thrombosis - thrombophlebitis; Thrombophilia - thrombophlebitis,Thrombophlebitis often causes the following symptoms:; Swelling in the part of the body affected; Pain in the part of the body affected; Skin redness (not always present); Warmth and tenderness over the vein,"Thrombophlebitis may affect deeper, larger veins or veins near the skin surface. Most of the time, it occurs in the pelvis and legs.; Blood clots may form when something slows or changes the flow of blood in the veins. Risk factors include:; Blood is more likely to clot in someone who has certain problems or disorders, such as:; A pacemaker catheter that has been passed through the vein in the groin; Bed rest or sitting in one position for too long, such as plane travel; Family history of blood clots, which may imply the presence of inherited disorders that lead to increased risk of clots. Common ones include deficiency or lack of antithrombin 3, protein C, and protein S, factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin abnormalities; Fractures in the pelvis or legs; Giving birth within the last 6 months; Pregnancy; Obesity; Recent surgery (most commonly hip, knee, or female pelvic surgery); Too many blood cells being made by the bone marrow, causing the blood to be thicker than normal (polycythemia vera); Having an indwelling (long-term) catheter in a blood vessel; Cancer; Certain autoimmune disorders, such as lupus; Cigarette smoking; Conditions that make it more likely to develop blood clots; Taking estrogens or birth control pills (this risk is even higher with smoking)"
001109,Varicose veins,Varicosity,"Symptoms of varicose veins include:; If flow of blood through the veins becomes poor enough, symptoms may include:; Fullness, heaviness, aching, and sometimes pain in the legs; Visible, swollen veins; Very small veins that you can see on the surface of the skin, called spider veins.; Thigh or calf cramps (often at night); Mild swelling of feet or ankles; Itching near the varicose veins; Restless leg symptoms; Leg swelling; Leg or calf pain after sitting or standing for long periods; Skin color changes of the legs or ankles; Dry, irritated, scaly skin that can crack easily; Skin sores (ulcers) that do not heal easily; Thickening and hardening of the skin in the legs and ankles (this can happen over time)","Normally, one-way valves in your leg veins keep blood moving up toward the heart. When the valves do not work properly, they allow blood to back up into the vein. The vein swells from the blood that collects there, which causes varicose veins over time.; Varicose veins are common, and affect more women than men. They do not cause problems for most people. However, if the flow of blood through veins becomes poor enough, problems such as leg swelling and pain, blood clots, and skin changes may be present.; Risk factors include:; Older age; Being female (hormonal changes from puberty, pregnancy, and menopause can lead to varicose veins, and taking birth control pills or hormone replacement can increase your risk); Being born with defective valves in the veins; Obesity; Pregnancy; History of blood clots in your legs; Standing or sitting for long periods of time; Family history of varicose veins"
001110,Tricuspid atresia,Tri atresia; Valve disorder - tricuspid atresia; Congenital heart - tricuspid atresia; Cyanotic heart disease - tricuspid atresia,Symptoms include:; Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood; Fast breathing; Fatigue; Poor growth; Shortness of breath,"Tricuspid atresia is an uncommon form of congenital heart disease. It affects about 5 in every 100,000 live births. One in five people with this condition will also have other heart problems.; Normally, blood flows from the body into the right atrium, then through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and on to the lungs. If the tricuspid valve does not open, the blood cannot flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Because of the problem with the tricuspid valve, blood ultimately cannot enter the lungs. This is where it must go to pick up oxygen (becomes oxygenated).; Instead, the blood passes through a hole between the right and left atrium. In the left atrium, it mixes with oxygen-rich blood returning from the lungs. This mix of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood is then pumped out into the body from the left ventricle. This causes the oxygen level in the blood to be lower than normal.; In people with tricuspid atresia, the lungs receive blood either through a hole between the right and left atria (described above), or through maintenance of a fetal vessel called the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus connects the pulmonary artery (artery to the lungs) to the aorta (main artery to the body). It is present when a baby is born, but normally closes by itself shortly after birth."
001111,Truncus arteriosus,Truncus,Symptoms include:; Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood; Delayed growth or growth failure; Fatigue; Lethargy; Poor feeding; Rapid breathing (tachypnea); Shortness of breath (dyspnea); Widening of the finger tips (clubbing),"In normal circulation, the pulmonary artery comes out of the right ventricle and the aorta comes out of the left ventricle, which are separate from each other.; With truncus arteriosus, a single artery comes out of the ventricles. There is most often also a large hole between the 2 ventricles (ventricular septal defect). As a result, the blue (without oxygen) and red (oxygen-rich) blood mix.; Some of this mixed blood goes to the lungs, and some goes to the rest of the body. Often, more blood than usual ends up going to the lungs.; If this condition is not treated, two problems occur:; Too much blood circulation in the lungs may cause extra fluid to build up in and around them. This makes it hard to breathe.; If left untreated and more than normal blood flows to the lungs for a long time, the blood vessels to the lungs become permanently damaged. Over time, it becomes very hard for the heart to force blood through them. This is called pulmonary hypertension, which can be life threatening."
001113,Patent foramen ovale,PFO; Congenital heart defect - PFO,Infants with a PFO and no other heart defects do not have symptoms. Some adults with PFOs also suffer from migraine headaches.,"A foramen ovale allows blood to go around the lungs. A baby's lungs are not used when it grows in the womb, so the hole does not cause problems in an unborn infant.; The opening is supposed to close soon after birth, but sometimes it does not. In about 1 out of 4 people, the opening never closes. If it does not close, it is called a PFO.; The cause of a PFO is unknown. There are no known risk factors.Â It can be found along with other heart abnormalities such as atrial septal aneurysms or Chiari network."
001114,Congenital heart disease,,"Symptoms depend on the condition. Although CHD is present at birth, the symptoms may not appear right away.; Defects such as coarctation of the aorta may not cause problems for years. Other problems, such as a small VSD, ASD, or PDA may never cause any problems.","CHD can describe a number of different problems affecting the heart. It is the most common type of birth defect. CHD causes more deaths in the first year of life than any other birth defects.; CHD is often divided into two types: cyanotic (blue skin color caused by a lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic. The following lists cover the most common CHDs:; Cyanotic:; Non-cyanotic:; These problems may occur alone or together. Most children with CHD do not have other types of birth defects. However, heart defects may be part of genetic and chromosomal syndromes. Some of these syndromes may be passed down through families.; Examples include:; Often, no cause for the heart disease can be found. CHDs continue to be investigated and researched. Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems.; Poorly controlled blood sugar in women who have diabetes during pregnancy has also been linked to an increased rate of congenital heart defects.; Ebstein anomaly; Hypoplastic left heart; Pulmonary atresia; Tetralogy of Fallot; Total anomalous pulmonary venous return; Transposition of the great vessels; Tricuspid atresia; Truncus arteriosus; Aortic stenosis; Bicuspid aortic valve; Atrial septal defect (ASD); Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect); Coarctation of the aorta; Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA); Pulmonic stenosis; Ventricular septal defect (VSD); DiGeorge syndrome; Down syndrome; Marfan syndrome; Noonan syndrome; Edwards syndrome; Trisomy 13; Turner syndrome"
001115,Total anomalous pulmonary venous return,TAPVR; Total veins; Congenital heart defect - TAPVR; Cyanotic heart disease - TAPVR,"The infant may appear very sick and may have the following symptoms:; Note: Sometimes, no symptoms may be present in infancy or early childhood.; Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood; Frequent respiratory infections; Lethargy; Poor feeding; Poor growth; Rapid breathing","The cause of total anomalous pulmonary venous return is unknown.; In normal circulation, blood is sent from the right ventricle to pick up oxygen in the lungs. It then returns through the pulmonary (lung) veins to the left side of the heart, which sends blood out through the aorta and around the body.; In TAPVR, oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the right atrium or to a vein flowing into the right atrium, instead of the left side of heart. In other words, blood simply circles to and from the lungs and never gets out to the body.; For the infant to live, an atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (passage between the left and right atria) must exist to allow oxygenated blood to flow to the left side of the heart and the rest of the body.; How severe this condition is depends on whether the pulmonary veins are blocked or obstructed as they drain. Obstructed TAPVR causes symptoms early in life and can be deadly very quickly if it is not found and corrected with surgery."
001116,Williams syndrome,Williams-Beuren syndrome; WBS; Beuren syndrome; 7q11.23 deletion syndrome; Elfin facies syndrome,"Symptoms of Williams syndrome are:; The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show:; Feeding problems, including colic, reflux, and vomiting; Inward bend of the small finger; Sunken chest; Heart disease or blood vessel problems; Developmental delay, mild to moderate intellectual disability, learning disorders; Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing; Easily distracted, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music; Short height, compared to the rest of the person's biologic relatives; A flattened nasal bridge with small, upturned nose; Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip; Prominent lips with an open mouth; Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye; Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth","Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of 25 to 27 genes on chromosome number 7.; One of the missing genes is the gene that produces elastin. This is a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition.; In most cases, the gene changes occur on their own, either in the sperm or egg that a baby develops from.; However, once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it."
001117,Lymphatic obstruction,Lymphedema,"The main symptom is persistent (chronic) swelling, usually of the arm or leg.","The most common reason for lymphatic obstruction is the removal or enlargement of the lymph nodes.; Other causes of lymphatic obstruction include:; A common cause of lymphedema is removal of the breast (mastectomy) and underarm lymph tissue for breast cancer treatment. This causes lymphedema of the arm in some people, because the lymphatic drainage of the arm passes through the armpit (axilla).; Rare forms of lymphedema that are present from birth (congenital) may result from problems in the development of the lymphatic vessels.; Infections with parasites, such as filariasis; Injury; Radiation therapy; Skin infections, such as cellulitis (more common in obese people); Surgery; Tumors"
001119,Thoracic aortic aneurysm,Aortic aneurysm - thoracic; Syphilitic aneurysm; Aneurysm - thoracic aortic,"Aneurysms develop slowly over many years. Most people have no symptoms until the aneurysm begins to leak or expand.; Symptoms often begin suddenly when:; If the aneurysm presses on nearby structures, the following symptoms may occur:; Other symptoms may include:; The aneurysm grows quickly.; The aneurysm tears open (called a rupture).; Blood leaks along the wall of the aorta (aortic dissection).; Hoarseness; Swallowing problems; High-pitched breathing (stridor); Swelling in the neck; Chest or upper back pain; Clammy skin; Nausea and vomiting; Rapid heart rate; Sense of impending doom","The most common cause of a thoracic aortic aneurysm is hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). This condition is more common in people with high cholesterol, long-term high blood pressure, or who smoke.; Other risk factors for a thoracic aneurysm include:; Changes caused by age; Connective tissue disorders such as Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; Inflammation of the aorta; Injury from falls or motor vehicle accidents; Syphilis"
001122,Aneurysm,Aneurysm - splenic artery; Aneurysm - popliteal artery; Aneurysm - mesenteric artery,"The symptoms depend on where the aneurysm is located. If the aneurysm occurs near the body's surface, pain and swelling with a throbbing lump is often seen.; Aneurysms in the body or brain often cause no symptoms. Aneurysms in the brain may expand without breaking open (rupturing). The expanded aneurysm may press on nerves and cause double vision, dizziness, or headaches. Some aneurysms may cause ringing in the ears.; If an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur. When a brain aneurysm ruptures, there is a sudden severe headache that some people say is the ""worst headache of my life."" The risk of neurologic injury, coma, or death after a rupture is high.","It is often not clear exactly what causes aneurysms. Some aneurysms are present at birth (congenital). Defects in some parts of the artery wall may be a cause.; Common locations for aneurysms include:; Certain factors or conditions may increase the risk for aneurysms including:; Inherited disorders that may increase the risk include:; Major artery from the heart such as the thoracic or abdominal aorta; Brain (cerebral aneurysm); Behind the knee (popliteal artery aneurysm); Intestine (mesenteric artery aneurysm); Artery in the spleen (splenic artery aneurysm); High blood pressure (thoracic, abdominal and cerebral aneurysms); High cholesterol; Cigarette smoking; Illicit drug use (cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine); Pregnancy (often linked to splenic artery aneurysms); Family history (sibling, parent, or child); Fibromuscular dysplasia (abnormal cell growth in artery walls); Marfan syndromeÂ; Polycystic kidney disease; Coarctation of the aorta; Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM)"
001123,Aortic arch syndrome,Subclavian artery occlusive syndrome; Carotid artery occlusion syndrome; Subclavian steal syndrome; Vertebral-basilar artery occlusive syndrome; Takayasu disease; Pulseless disease,"Symptoms vary according to which artery or other structure that has been affected. Symptoms may include:; Blood pressure changes; Breathing problems; Dizziness, blurred vision, weakness, and other brain and nervous system (neurological) changes; Numbness of an arm; Reduced pulse; Swallowing problems; Transient ischemic attacks (TIA)","Aortic arch syndrome problems can be due to trauma, blood clots, or malformations that develop before birth. These defects result in abnormal blood flow to the head, neck, or arms.; In children, there are many types of aortic arch syndromes, including:; An inflammatory disease called Takayasu syndrome may result in narrowing (stenosis) of the vessels of the aortic arch. This typically occurs in women and girls. This disease is seen more often in people of Asian descent.; Congenital absence of a branch of the aorta; Isolation of the subclavian arteries; Vascular rings"
001124,Blood clots,Clot; Emboli; Thrombi; Thromboembolus; Hypercoagulable state,,"Situations in which a blood clot is more likely to form in veins include:; Blood clots are also more likely to form after an injury. People with cancer, obesity, and liver or kidney disease are also prone to blood clots.; Smoking also increases the risk of forming blood clots.; Conditions that are passed down through families (inherited) may make you more likely to form abnormal blood clots. Inherited conditions that affect clotting are:; Other rare conditions, such as protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III deficiencies.; A blood clot may block an artery or vein in an organ, affecting the:; Being on long-term bed rest; Sitting for long periods, such as in a plane or car; During and after pregnancy; Taking birth control pills or estrogen hormones (especially in women who smoke); Long-term use of an intravenous catheter; After surgery; Factor V Leiden mutation; Prothrombin G20210A mutation; Heart (angina or a heart attack); Intestines (mesenteric ischemia or mesenteric venous thrombosis); Kidneys (renal vein thrombosis); Leg or arm arteries; Legs (deep vein thrombosis); Lungs (pulmonary embolism); Neck or brain (stroke)"
001125,Colitis,,Symptoms can include:; Abdominal pain and bloatingÂ thatÂ may be constant or come and go; Bloody stoolsÂ; Constant urge to have a bowel movement (tenesmus); Dehydration; Diarrhea; Fever,"Most of the time, the cause of colitis is not known.; Causes of colitis include:; Infections caused by a virus or a parasite; Food poisoning due to bacteria; Crohn disease; Ulcerative colitis; Lack of blood flow to the colon (ischemic colitis); Past radiation to the colon (radiation colitis and strictures); Necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns; Pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infectionÂ (now called Clostridiodes difficile)"
001126,MSG symptom complex,Hot dog headache; Glutamate-induced asthma; MSG (monosodium glutamate) syndrome; Chinese restaurant syndrome; Kwok's syndrome,"Symptoms, if they occur, are usually mild and go away in a short time:; Flushing; Headache; Muscle aches; Numbness or burning in or around the mouth; Heart palpitations; Tingling; Drowsiness","Reports of reactions to MSG originated in 1968 in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Since then, reports of reactions to MSG have come from people claiming to experience symptoms after consuming food containing MSG. However, studies on MSG in foods have failed to find a conclusive link between MSG and the symptoms some people describe.; The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did a study of the issue and found no evidence that MSG in food caused symptoms. The report did find minor reactions in people who consumed 3 or more grams of MSG alone without food. Most foods with MSG have less than 0.5 grams of the additive.; MSG is rated as ""generally considered safe"" by the FDA."
001127,Crigler-Najjar syndrome,Glucuronyl transferase deficiency (type I Crigler-Najjar); Arias syndrome (type II Crigler-Najjar),"Symptoms may include:; Confusion and changes in thinking; Yellow skin (jaundice) and yellow in the whites of the eyes (icterus), which begin a few days after birth and get worse over time; Lethargy; Poor feeding; Vomiting","An enzyme converts bilirubin into a form that can easily be removed from the body. Crigler-Najjar syndrome occurs when this enzyme does not work correctly. Without this enzyme, bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to:; Type I Crigler-Najjar is the form of the disease that starts early in life. Type II Crigler-Najjar syndrome may start later in life.; The syndrome runs in families (inherited). A child must receive a copy of the variant gene from both parents to develop the severe form of the condition. Parents who are carriers (with just one variant gene) have about one half the enzyme activity of a normal adult, but do not have symptoms.; Jaundice (yellow discoloration of skin and eyes); Damage to the brain, muscles, and nerves"
001129,Gastrointestinal fistula,Entero-enteral fistula; Enterocutaneous fistula; Fistula - gastrointestinal; Crohn disease - fistula,"Depending on where the leak is, these fistulas may cause diarrhea, and poor absorption of nutrients. Your body may not have as much water and fluids as it needs.; Some fistulas may not cause symptoms.; Other fistulas cause intestinal contents to leak through an opening in the skin.","Most gastrointestinal fistulas occur after surgery. Other causes include:; Blockage in the intestine; Infection (such as diverticulitis); Crohn disease; Radiation to the abdomen (most often given as part of cancer treatment); Injury, such as deep wounds from stabbing or gunshot; Swallowing caustic substances (such as lye)"
001130,Anal fissure,Fissure in ano; Anorectal fissure; Anal ulcer,An anal fissure can be seen as a crack in the anal skin when the area is stretched slightly. The fissure is almost always in the middle. Anal fissures may cause painful bowel movements and bleeding. There may be blood on the outside of the stool or on the toilet paper (or baby wipes) after a bowel movement.; Symptoms may begin suddenly or develop slowly over time.,"Anal fissures are very common in infants, but they may occur at any age.; In adults, fissures may be caused by passing large, hard stools, or having diarrhea for a long time. Other factors may include:; The condition affects males and females equally. Anal fissures are also common in women after childbirth and in people with Crohn disease.; Decreased blood flow to the area; Too much tension in the sphincter muscles that control the anus"
001131,Duodenal atresia,,"Symptoms of duodenal atresia include:; Upper abdominal swelling (sometimes); Early vomiting of large amounts, which may be greenish (containing bile); Continued vomiting even when infant has not been fed for several hours; No bowel movements after first few meconium stools","The cause of duodenal atresia is not known. It is thought to result from problems during an embryo's development. The duodenum does not change from a solid to a tube-like structure, as it normally would.; Many infants with duodenal atresia also have Down syndrome. Duodenal atresia is often associated with other birth defects."
001132,Rectal prolapse,Procidentia; Rectal intussusception,"The main symptom is a reddish-colored mass that sticks out from the opening of the anus, especially after a bowel movement. This reddish mass is actually the inner lining of the rectum. It may bleed slightly and can be uncomfortable and painful.","The exact cause of rectal prolapse is unclear. Possible causes may include any of the following:; A prolapse can be partial or complete:; Rectal prolapse occurs most often in children under age 6 years. Health problems that may lead to prolapse include:; In adults, it is usually found with constipation, or with a muscle or nerve problem in the pelvic or genital area.; An enlarged opening due to relaxed muscles in the pelvic floor, which is formed of muscles around the rectum; Loose muscles of the anal sphincter; An abnormally long colon; Downward movement of the abdominal cavity between the rectum and uterus; Prolapse of the small intestine; Constipation; Diarrhea; Chronic coughing and sneezing; With a partial prolapse, the inner lining of the rectum bulges partly from the anus.; With a complete prolapse, the entire rectum bulges through the anus.; Cystic fibrosis; Intestinal worm infections; Long-term diarrhea; Other health problems present at birth"
001134,Gastroesophageal reflux in infants,Reflux - infants,"Symptoms may include:; Cough, especially after eating; Excessive crying as if in pain; Excessive vomiting during the first few weeks of life; worse after eating; Extremely forceful vomiting; Not feeding well; Refusing to eat; Slow growth; Weight loss; Wheezing or other breathing problems","When a person eats, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. The esophagus is called the food pipe or swallowing tube.; A ring of muscle fibers prevents food at the top of the stomach from moving up into the esophagus. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES. If this muscle does not close well, food can leak back into the esophagus. This is called gastroesophageal reflux.; A small amount of gastroesophageal reflux is normal in young infants. However, ongoing reflux with frequent vomiting can irritate the esophagus and make the infant fussy. Severe reflux that causes weight loss or breathing problems is not normal."
001135,Diaphragmatic hernia,Hernia - diaphragmatic; Congenital hernia of the diaphragm (CDH),Severe breathing problems usually develop shortly after the baby is born. This is due in part to poor movement of the diaphragm muscle and crowding of the lung tissue. Problems with breathing and oxygen levels are often due to underdeveloped lung tissue and blood vessels as well.; Other symptoms include:; Bluish colored skin due to lack of oxygen; Rapid breathing (tachypnea); Fast heart rate (tachycardia),"A diaphragmatic hernia is a rare defect. It occurs while the baby is developing in the womb. The diaphragm is not fully developed. Due to this, organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, spleen, part of the liver, and the kidney may take up part of the chest cavity.; CDH most often involves only one side of the diaphragm. It is more common on the left side. Often, the lung tissue and blood vessels in the area do not develop normally either. It is not clear if the diaphragmatic hernia causes the underdeveloped lung tissue and blood vessels, or the other way around.; Forty percent of babies with this condition have other problems as well. Having a parent or sibling with the condition increases the risk."
001136,Femoral hernia,Groin hernia,"You may see a bulge in the upper thigh, just below the groin.; Most femoral hernias cause no symptoms. You may have some groin discomfort. It may be worse when you stand, lift heavy objects, or strain.; Sometimes, the first symptoms are:; This may mean that the intestine within the hernia is blocked. This is an emergency.; Sudden groin or thigh pain; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting","Most of the time, there is no clear cause of a hernia. Some hernias may be present at birth (congenital), but are not noticed until later in life.; Some factors that contribute to the development of a hernia include:; Femoral hernias tend to occur more often in women than in men.; Chronic constipation; Chronic cough; Heavy lifting; Obesity; Straining to urinate because of an enlarged prostate"
001137,Hiatal hernia,Hernia - hiatal,"Symptoms may include:; A hiatal hernia by itself rarely causes symptoms. Pain and discomfort are due to the upward flow of stomach acid, air, or bile.; Chest pain; Heartburn, worse when bending over or lying down; Swallowing difficulty","The exact cause of hiatal hernia is not known. The condition may be due to weakness of the supporting tissue. Your risk for the problem goes up with age, obesity, and smoking. Hiatal hernias are very common. The problem occurs often in people over 50 years of age.; This condition may be linked to reflux (backflow) of gastric acid from the stomach into the esophagus.; Children with this condition are most often born with it (congenital). In infants, it often occurs with gastroesophageal reflux."
001139,Proctitis,Inflammation - rectum; Rectal inflammation,"Symptoms include:; Bloody stools; Constipation; Rectal bleeding; Rectal discharge, pus; Rectal pain or discomfort; Tenesmus (pain with bowel movement)","There are many causes of proctitis. They can be grouped as follows:; Proctitis caused by an STD is common in people who have anal intercourse. STDs that can cause proctitis include gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, and lymphogranuloma venereum.; Infections that are not sexually transmitted are less common than STD proctitis. One type of proctitis not from an STD is an infection in children that is caused by the same bacteria as strep throat.; Autoimmune proctitis is linked to diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease. If the inflammation is in the rectum only, it may come and go or move upward into the large intestine.; Proctitis may also be caused by some medicines, radiotherapy to prostate or pelvis or inserting harmful substances into the rectum.; Risk factors include:; Inflammatory bowel disease; Autoimmune disease; Harmful substances; Non-sexually transmitted infection; Sexually transmitted disease (STD); Autoimmune disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease; High-risk sexual practices, such as anal sex"
001140,Hirschsprung disease,Congenital megacolon; Hirschsprung's disease,Symptoms that may be present in newborns and infants include:; Symptoms in older children:; Difficulty with bowel movements; Failure to pass meconium shortly after birth; Failure to pass a first stool within 24 to 48 hours after birth; Infrequent but explosive stools; Jaundice; Poor feeding; Poor weight gain; Vomiting; Watery diarrhea (in the newborn); Constipation that gradually gets worse; Fecal impaction; Malnutrition; Slow growth; Swollen belly,"Muscle contractions in the gut help digested foods and liquids move through the intestine. This is called peristalsis. Nerves between the muscle layers trigger the contractions.; In people with Hirschsprung disease, the nerves are missing from a part of the bowel. Areas without these nerves cannot push material through. This causes a blockage. Intestinal contents build up behind the blockage. The bowel and abdomen swell as a result.; Hirschsprung disease causes about 25% of all newborn intestinal blockages. It occurs 5 times more often in males than in females. Hirschsprung disease is sometimes linked to other inherited or congenital conditions, such as Down syndrome."
001141,Liver spots,Sun-induced skin changes - liver spots; Senile or solar lentigo or lentigines; Skin spots - aging; Age spots,Liver spots appear as a patch or area of skin color change that is:; Flat; Light brown to black; Painless,"Liver spots are changes in skin color that occur in older skin. The coloring may be due to aging, exposure to the sun or other sources of ultraviolet light, or causes that are not known.; Liver spots are very common after age 40. They occur most often on areas that have had the greatest sun exposure, such as the:; Backs of the hands; Face; Forearms; Forehead; Shoulders"
001142,Annular pancreas,,"Newborns may not feed well. They may spit up more than normal, not drink enough breast milk or formula, and cry.; Adult symptoms may include:; Abdominal pain; Fullness after eating; Nausea or vomiting","Annular pancreas is problem present at birth (congenital defect). Symptoms occur when the ring of pancreas squeezes and narrows the small intestine so that food cannot pass easily or at all.; Newborns may have symptoms of complete blockage of the intestine. However, up to one half of people with this condition do not have symptoms until adulthood. There are also cases that are not detected because the symptoms are mild.; Conditions that may be associated with annular pancreas include:; Down syndrome; Excess amniotic fluid during pregnancy (polyhydramnios); Other congenital gastrointestinal problems; Pancreatitis"
001143,Barrett esophagus,Barrett's esophagus; GERD - Barrett; Reflux - Barrett,BE itself does not cause symptoms. The acid reflux that causes BE often leads to symptoms of heartburn. Many people with this condition do not have any symptoms.,"When you eat, food passes from your throat to your stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus keeps stomach contents from moving backward.; If these muscles do not close tightly, harsh stomach acid can leak into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). It may cause tissue damage over time. The lining becomes similar to that of the intestine.; BE occurs more often in men than women. People who have had GERD for a long time are more likely to have this condition."
001145,Biliary atresia,Jaundice newborns - biliary atresia; Newborn jaundice - biliary atresia; Extrahepatic ductopenia; Progressive obliterative cholangiopathy,"Symptoms usually start to occur between 2 to 8 weeks. Jaundice (a yellow color to the skin and mucus membranes) develops slowly 2 to 3 weeks after birth. The infant may gain weight normally for the first month. After that point, the baby will lose weight and become irritable, and will have worsening jaundice.; Other symptoms may include:; Dark urine; Swollen belly; Foul-smelling and floating stools; Pale or clay-colored stools; Slow growth","Biliary atresia occurs when the bile ducts inside or outside the liver are abnormally narrow, blocked, or absent. The bile ducts carry a digestive fluid from liver to small bowel to break down fats and filter out waste from the body.; The cause of the disease is not clear. It may be due to:; It more commonly affects people of East Asian and African-American descent.; The bile ducts help remove waste from the liver and carry salts that help the small intestine break down (digest) fat.; In babies with biliary atresia, bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder is blocked. This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver, which can be deadly.; Viral infection after birth; Exposure to toxic substances; Multiple genetic factors; Perinatal injury; Some medicines such as carbamazepine"
001147,Imperforate anus,Anorectal malformation; Anal atresia,"Symptoms of the problem may include:; Anal opening very near the vagina opening in girls; First stool is not passed within 24 to 48 hours after birth; Missing or moved opening to the anus; Stool passes out of the vagina, base of penis, scrotum, or urethra; Swollen belly area","Imperforate anus may occur in several forms:; It is caused by abnormal development of the fetus. Many forms of imperforate anus occur with other birth defects.; The rectum may end in a pouch that does not connect with the colon.; The rectum may have openings to other structures. These may include the urethra, bladder, base of the penis or scrotum in boys, or vagina in girls.; There may be narrowing (stenosis) of the anus or no anus."
001148,Necrotizing enterocolitis,,"Symptoms may come on slowly or suddenly, and may include:; Abdominal bloating; Blood in the stool; Diarrhea; Feeding problems; Lack of energy; Unstable body temperature; Unstable breathing, heart rate, or blood pressure; Vomiting","NEC occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies. This problem nearly always develops in an infant who is ill or premature. It is likely to occur while the infant is still in the hospital.; The exact cause of this disorder is unknown. A drop in blood flow to the bowel can damage the tissue. Bacteria in the intestine may also add to the problem. Also, premature infants have an undeveloped immune response to factors such as bacteria or low blood flow. An imbalance in immune regulation appears to be involved in NEC.; Babies at higher risk for the condition include:; Premature infants; Infants who are fed formula rather than human milk. (Human milk contains growth factors, antibodies and immune cells which may help prevent the problem.); Infants in a nursery where an outbreak has occurred; Infants who have received blood exchange transfusions or have been seriously ill"
001149,Enteritis,,The symptoms may begin hours to days after you become infected. Symptoms may include:; Abdominal pain; Diarrhea -- acute and severe; Loss of appetite; Vomiting; Blood in the stool,"Enteritis is most often caused by eating or drinking things that are contaminated with bacteria or viruses. The germs settle in the small intestine and cause inflammation and swelling.; Enteritis may also be caused by:; The inflammation can also involve the stomach (gastritis) and large intestine (colitis).; Risk factors include:; Types of enteritis include:; An autoimmune condition, such as Crohn disease; Certain medicines, including NSAIDS (such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium) and cocaine; Damage from radiation therapy; Celiac disease; Tropical sprue; Whipple disease; Recent stomach flu among household members; Recent travel; Exposure to unclean water; Bacterial gastroenteritis; Campylobacter enteritis; E coli enteritis; Food poisoning; Radiation enteritis; Salmonella enteritis; Shigella enteritis; Staph aureus food poisoning; Non-bacterial infections such as viruses and protozoa"
001150,Gastritis,,"Many people with gastritis do not have any symptoms.; Symptoms you may notice are:; If gastritis is causing bleeding from the lining of the stomach, symptoms may include:; Loss of appetite; Nausea and vomiting; Pain in the upper part of the belly or abdomen; Black stools; Vomiting blood or coffee-ground-like material","The most common causes of gastritis are:; Less common causes are:; Trauma or a severe, sudden illness such as major surgery, kidney failure, or being placed on a breathing machine may cause gastritis.; Certain medicines, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen and other similar drugs; Heavy alcohol drinking; Infection of the stomach with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori; Autoimmune disorders (such as pernicious anemia); Backflow of bile into the stomach (bile reflux); Cocaine use; Eating or drinking caustic or corrosive substances (such as poisons); Extreme stress; Viral infection, such as cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus (more often occurs in people with a weak immune system)"
001151,Small intestinal ischemia and infarction,Intestinal necrosis; Ischemic bowel - small intestine; Dead bowel - small intestine; Dead gut - small intestine; Infarcted bowel - small intestine; Atherosclerosis - small intestine; Hardening of the arteries - small intestine,"The main symptom of intestinal ischemia is pain in abdomen. The pain is severe, even though the area is not very tender when touched. Other symptoms include:; Diarrhea; Fever; Vomiting; Blood in the stool","There are several possible causes of intestinal ischemia and infarction.; Hernia -- If the intestine moves into the wrong place or becomes tangled, it can cut off the blood flow.; Adhesions -- The intestine may become trapped in scar tissue (adhesions) from past surgery. This can lead to loss of blood flow if left untreated.; Embolus -- Blood clots can block one of the arteries supplying the intestine. People who have had a heart attack or who have heartÂ arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, are at risk for this problem.; Narrowing of the arteries -- The arteries that supply blood to the intestine may become narrowed or blocked from cholesterol buildup. When this happens in the arteries to the heart, it causes a heart attack. When it happens in the arteries to the intestine, it causes intestinal ischemia.; Narrowing of the veins -- The veins carrying blood away from the intestine may become blocked by blood clots. This blocks blood flow in the intestine. This is more common in people with liver disease, cancer, or blood clotting disorders.; Low blood pressure -- Very low blood pressure in people who already have narrowing of the intestinal arteries may also cause loss of blood flow to the intestine. This often occurs in people with other serious medical problems."
001152,Pinworms,Enterobiasis; Oxyuriasis; Threadworm; Seatworm; Enterobius vermicularis; E vermicularis; Helminthic infection,"Symptoms of pinworm infection include:; Difficulty sleeping due to the itching that occurs during the night; Intense itching around the anus; Irritability due to itching and interrupted sleep; Irritated or infected skin around the anus, from constant scratching; Irritation or discomfort of the vagina in young girls (if an adult worm enters the vagina rather than the anus); Loss of appetite and weight (uncommon, but can occur in severe infections)","Pinworms are the most common worm infection in the United States. School-age children are most often affected.; Pinworm eggs are spread directly from person to person. They can also be spread by touching bedding, food, or other items that are contaminated with the eggs.; Typically, children are infected by touching pinworm eggs without knowing it and then putting their fingers in their mouth. They swallow the eggs, which eventually hatch in the small intestine. The worms mature in the colon.; Female worms then move to the child's anal area, especially at night, and deposit more eggs. This may cause intense itching. The area may even become infected. When the child scratches the anal area, the eggs can get under the child's fingernails. These eggs can be transferred to other children, family members, and items in the house."
001153,Esophagitis,Inflammation - esophagus; Erosive esophagitis; Ulcerative esophagitis; Eosinophilic esophagitis,The infection or irritation may cause the food pipe to become inflamed. Sores called ulcers may form.; Symptoms may include:; Cough; Difficulty swallowing; Painful swallowing; Heartburn (acid reflux); Hoarseness; Sore throat,"Esophagitis is often caused by stomach fluid that flows back into the food pipe. The fluid contains acid, which irritates the esophageal lining. This problem is called gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). An autoimmune disorder called eosinophilic esophagitis also causes this condition.; The following increase your risk for this condition:; People who have a weakened immune system may develop infections. Infections may lead to swelling of the food pipe. Infection may be due to:; Alcohol use; Cigarette smoking; Surgery or radiation to the chest (for example, treatment for lung cancer); Taking certain medicines such as alendronate, doxycycline, ibandronate, risedronate, tetracycline, potassium tablets, and vitamin C, without drinking plenty of water; Vomiting; Lying down after eating a large meal; Obesity; Fungi or yeast (most often Candida); Viruses, such as herpes or cytomegalovirus"
001154,Hepatitis,,"Hepatitis may start and get better quickly. It may also become a long-term condition. In some cases, hepatitis may lead to liver damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer or even death.; There are several factors that can affect how severe the condition is. These may include the cause of the liver damage and any illnesses you have. Hepatitis A, for example, is most often short-term and does not lead to chronic liver problems.; The symptoms of hepatitis include:; You may not have symptoms when first infected with hepatitis B or C. You can still develop liver failure later. If you have any risk factors for either type of hepatitis, ask your health care provider whether you should be tested for them.; Pain or bloating in the belly area; Dark urine and pale or clay-colored stools; Fatigue; Low grade fever; Itching; Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes); Loss of appetite; Nausea and vomiting; Weight loss","Hepatitis can be caused by:; Liver disease can also be caused by inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis or hemochromatosis, a condition that involves having too much iron in your body.; Other causes include Wilson disease, a disorder in which the body retains too much copper and ingestion of toxic mushrooms.; Immune cells in the body attacking the liver (autoimmune hepatitis); Infections from viruses (such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C), bacteria, or parasites; Liver damage from alcohol or poison; Medicines, such as an overdose of acetaminophen; Fatty liver"
001156,Mesenteric artery ischemia,Mesenteric vascular disease; Ischemic colitis; Ischemic bowel - mesenteric; Dead bowel - mesenteric; Dead gut - mesenteric; Atherosclerosis - mesenteric artery; Hardening of the arteries - mesenteric artery; Ischemic necrosis - mesenteric artery,Symptoms caused by gradual hardening of the mesenteric arteries include:; Symptoms of sudden (acute) mesenteric artery ischemia due to a traveling blood clot include:; Abdominal pain after eating; Diarrhea; Sudden severe abdominal pain or bloating; Diarrhea; Vomiting; Fever; Nausea,"The arteries that supply blood to the intestines run directly from the aorta. The aorta is the main artery from the heart.; Hardening of the arteries occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. This is more common in smokers and in people with high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol.; This narrows the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the intestines. Like every other part of the body, blood brings oxygen to the intestines. When the oxygen supply is reduced, symptoms may occur.; The blood supply to the intestines may be suddenly blocked by a blood clot (embolus). The clots most often come from the heart or aorta. These clots are more commonly seen in people with abnormal heart rhythm."
001157,Mesenteric venous thrombosis,MVT,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Abdominal pain, which may get worse after eating and over time; Bloating; Constipation; Bloody diarrhea; Fever; Septic shock; Lower gastrointestinal bleeding; Vomiting and nausea","MVT is a clot that blocks blood flow in a mesenteric vein. There areÂ two such veins through which blood leaves the intestine. The condition stops the normal blood circulation of the intestine and can result in damage to the intestine.; The exact cause of MVT is unknown. However, there are many diseases that can lead to MVT. Many of the diseases cause swelling (inflammation) of the tissues surrounding the veins, and include:; People who have disorders that make the blood more likely to stick together (clot) have a higher risk for MVT and include:; Birth control pills and estrogen medicines also increase risk.; MVT is more common in men than women. It mainly affects middle aged or older adults.; Appendicitis; Cancer of the abdomen; Diverticulitis; Liver disease with cirrhosis; High blood pressure in the blood vessels of the liver; Abdominal surgery or trauma; Pancreatitis; Inflammatory bowel disordersÂ (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis); Heart failure; Protein C or S deficiencies; Polycythemia vera; Essential thrombocythemia"
001158,Plummer-Vinson syndrome,Paterson-Kelly syndrome; Sideropenic dysphagia; Esophageal web,Symptoms may include:; Difficulty swallowing; Weakness,The cause of Plummer-Vinson syndrome is unknown. Genetic factors and a lack of certain nutrients (nutritional deficiencies) may play a role. It is a rare disorder that can be linked to cancers of the esophagus and throat. It is more common in women.
001160,Menkes disease,Steely hair disease; Menkes kinky hair syndrome; Kinky hair disease; Copper transport disease; Trichopoliodystrophy; X-linked copper deficiency,"Common symptoms of Menkes disease in infants are:; Brittle, kinky, steely, sparse, or tangled hair; Pudgy, rosy cheeks, sagging facial skin; Feeding difficulties; Irritability; Decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), floppiness; Low body temperature; Intellectual disability and developmental delay; Seizures; Skeletal changes","Menkes disease is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene. The defect makes it hard for the body to properly distribute (transport) copper throughout the body. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper, while it builds up in the small intestine and kidneys. A low copper level can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function.; Menkes syndrome is usually inherited, which means it runs in families. The gene is on the X-chromosome, so if a mother carries the defective gene, each of her sons has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of developing the disease, and 50% of her daughters will be a carrier of the disease. This kind of gene inheritance is called X-linked recessive.; In some people, the disease is not inherited from their parents. Instead, the gene defect occurs at the time the baby is conceived."
001161,Metabolic neuropathies,Neuropathy - metabolic,"These symptoms occur because nerves cannot send proper signals to and from your brain:; These symptoms often start in the toes and feet and move up the legs, eventually affecting the hands and arms.; Difficulty feeling in any area of the body; Difficulty using the arms or hands; Difficulty using the legs or feet; Difficulty walking; Pain, burning feeling, a pins and needles feeling or shooting pains in any area of the body (nerve pain); Weakness in the face, arms, legs, or other areas of the body; Dysautonomia, which affects the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system, resulting in symptoms such as rapid heart rate, exercise intolerance, low blood pressure when standing, abnormal sweat patterns, stomach problems, abnormal functioning of the pupils of the eye, and poor erection","Nerve damage can be caused by many different things. Metabolic neuropathy may be caused by:; Diabetes is one of the most common causes of metabolic neuropathies. People who are at the highest risk for nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy) from diabetes include those who have:; Other common causes of metabolic neuropathies include:; Some metabolic disorders are passed down through families (inherited), while others develop due to various diseases.; A problem with the body's ability to use energy, often due to a lack of enough nutrients (nutritional deficiency); Dangerous substances (toxins) that build up in the body; Damage to the kidneys or eyes; Poorly controlled blood sugar; The longer one has diabetes, the more likely they are to get neuropathy; Alcohol use disorder (alcoholic neuropathy); Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia); Kidney failure; Inherited conditions, such as porphyria; Severe infection throughout the body (sepsis); Thyroid disease; Liver disease; Vitamin deficiencies (including vitamins B12, B6, E, and B1)"
001162,Methylmalonic acidemia,,"Babies may appear normal at birth, but develop symptoms once they start eating more protein, which can cause the condition to get worse. The disease can cause seizures and stroke.; Symptoms include:; Brain disease that gets worse (progressive encephalopathy); Dehydration; Developmental delays; Failure to thrive; Lethargy; Seizures; Vomiting",The disease is most often diagnosed in the first year of life. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means the defective gene must be passed onto the child from both parents.; A newborn with this rare condition may die before it is ever diagnosed. Methylmalonic acidemia affects boys and girls equally.
001163,Premature ovarian failure,Ovarian hypofunction; Ovarian insufficiency,"Women with premature ovarian failure may develop symptoms of menopause, which include:; This condition may also make it hard for a woman to become pregnant.; Hot flashes; Irregular or absent periods; Mood swings; Night sweats; Vaginal dryness","Premature ovarian failure may be caused by genetic factors such as chromosome abnormalities. It may also occur with certain autoimmune disorders that disrupt the normal function of the ovaries. Most often there is no obvious cause, although a family history of the condition may play a role.; Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can also cause premature ovarian failure."
001165,Ovarian overproduction of androgens,,"High levels of androgens in a female can cause:; These changes may also occur:; Acne; Changes in female body shape; Decrease in breast size; Increase in body hair in a male pattern, such as on the face, chin, and abdomen (called hirsutism); Lack of menstrual periods (amenorrhea); Oily skin; Increase in the size of the clitoris; Deepening of the voice; Increase in muscle mass; Thinning hair and hair loss at the front of the scalp on both sides of the head","In healthy women, the ovaries and adrenal glands produce about 40% to 50% of the body's testosterone. Tumors of the ovaries and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can both causeÂ too muchÂ androgen production.; Cushing disease is a problem with the pituitary gland thatÂ leads toÂ excess amounts of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may cause masculine body changes in women. Tumors in the adrenal glands can also cause too much production of androgens and can lead to male body characteristics in women."
001166,Phenylketonuria,PKU; Neonatal phenylketonuria,"Phenylalanine plays a role in the body's production of melanin. The pigment is responsible for skin and hair color. Therefore, infants with the condition often have lighter skin, hair, and eyes than brothers or sisters without the disease.; Other symptoms may include:; If PKU is untreated, or if foods containing phenylalanine are eaten, the breath, skin, ear wax, and urine may have a ""mousy"" or ""musty"" odor. This odor is due to a buildup of phenylalanine substances in the body.; Delayed mental and social skills; Head size much smaller than normal; Hyperactivity; Jerking movements of the arms or legs; Mental disability; Seizures; Skin rashes; Tremors","PKU is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.; Babies with PKU are missing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. It is needed to break down the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is found in foods that contain protein.; Without the enzyme, levels of phenylalanine build up in the body. This buildup can harm the central nervous system and cause brain damage."
001168,Precocious puberty,Pubertas praecox,"In girls, precocious puberty is when any of the following develop before age 8:; In boys, precocious puberty is when any of the following develop before age 9:; Armpit or pubic hair; Beginning to grow faster; Breasts; First period (menstruation); Mature outer genitals; Armpit or pubic hair; Growth of the testes and penis; Facial hair, often first on the upper lip; Muscle growth; Voice change (deepening)","Puberty usually begins between ages 8 and 13 for girls and ages 9 and 14 for boys.; The exact age a child enters puberty depends on a number of factors, including family history, nutrition, and sex.; Most often there is no clear cause for precocious puberty. Some cases are due to changes in the brain, genetic problems or certain tumors that release hormones. These conditions include:; Disorders of the testicles, ovaries, or adrenal glands; Tumor of the hypothalamus (hypothalamic hamartoma); Tumors that release a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)"
001172,Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor,Sertoli-stromal cell tumor; Arrhenoblastoma; Androblastoma; Ovarian cancer - Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor,"The Sertoli cells are normally located in the male reproductive glands (the testes). They feed sperm cells. The Leydig cells, also located in the testes, release a male sex hormone.; These cells are also found in a woman's ovaries, and in very rare cases lead to cancer. SLCT starts in the female ovaries, mostly in one ovary. The cancer cells release a male sex hormone. As a result, the woman may develop symptoms such as:; Pain in the lower belly (pelvic area) is another symptom. It occurs due to the tumor pressing on nearby structures.; A deep voice; Enlarged clitoris; Facial hair; Loss in breast size; Stopping of menstrual periods",The exact cause of this tumor is not known. Changes (alterations) in genes may play a role.; SLCT occur most often in young women 20 to 30 years old. But the tumor can occur at any age.
001173,Female pattern baldness,Alopecia in women; Baldness - female; Hair loss in women; Androgenetic alopecia in women; Hereditary balding or thinning in women,"Hair thinning is different from that of male pattern baldness. In female pattern baldness:; Itching or skin sores on the scalp are generally not seen.; Hair thins mainly on the top and crown of the scalp. It usually starts with a widening through the center hair part. This pattern of hair loss is known as Christmas tree pattern.; The front hairline remains unaffected except for normal recession, which happens to everyone as time passes.; The hair loss rarely progresses to total or near total baldness, as it may in men.; If the cause is increased androgens, hair on the head is thinner while hair on the face is coarser.","Each strand of hair sits in a tiny hole in the skin called a follicle. In general, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair. Eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair. The follicles remain alive, which suggests that it is still possible to grow new hair.; The reason for female pattern baldness is not well understood, but may be related to:; Aging; Changes in the levels of androgens (hormones that can stimulate male features); Family history of male or female pattern baldness; Heavy loss of blood during menstrual periods; Certain medicines, such as estrogenic oral contraceptives"
001174,Gigantism,Pituitary giant; Overproduction of growth hormone; Growth hormone - excess production,"The child will grow in height, as well as in the muscles and organs. This excessive growth makes the child extremely large for his or her age.; Other symptoms include:; Delayed puberty; Double vision or difficulty with side (peripheral) vision; Very prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and a prominent jaw; Gaps between the teeth; Headache; Increased sweating; Irregular periods (menstruation); Joint pain; Large hands and feet with thick fingers and toes; Release of breast milk; Sleep problems such as obstructive sleep apnea; Thickening of the facial features; Weakness; Voice changes","Gigantism is very rare. The most common cause of too much GH release is a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland. Other causes include:; If excess GH occurs after normal bone growth has stopped (end of puberty), the condition is known as acromegaly.; Genetic disease that affects the skin color (pigmentation) and causes benign tumors of the skin, heart, and endocrine (hormone) system (Carney complex); Genetic disease that affects the bones and skin pigmentation (McCune-Albright syndrome); Genetic disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) or type 4; Genetic disease that forms pituitary tumors; Disease in which tumors form on the nerves of the brain and spine (neurofibromatosis)"
001175,Sheehan syndrome,Postpartum hypopituitarism; Postpartum pituitary insufficiency; Hypopituitarism syndrome; Sheehan's syndrome,"Symptoms of Sheehan syndrome may include:; Note: Other than not being able to breastfeed, symptoms may not develop for several years after the delivery.; Inability to breastfeed (breast milk never ""comes in""); Fatigue; Lack of menstrual bleeding; Loss of pubic and armpit (axillary) hair; Low blood pressure","Severe bleeding during childbirth can cause tissue in the pituitary gland to die. This gland does not work properly as a result.; The pituitary gland is at the base of the brain. It makes hormones that stimulate growth, production of breast milk, reproductive functions, the thyroid, and the adrenal glands. A lack of these hormones can lead to a variety of symptoms. Conditions that increase the risk of bleeding during childbirth and Sheehan syndrome include multiple pregnancy (twins or triplets) and problems with the placenta. The placenta is the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed the fetus.; The condition is rare today due to advances in obstetric care."
001176,Growth hormone deficiency - children,Pituitary dwarfism; Acquired growth hormone deficiency; Isolated growth hormone deficiency; Congenital growth hormone deficiency; Panhypopituitarism; Short stature - growth hormone deficiency,"Slow growth may first be noticed in infancy and continue through childhood. Your child's health care provider will most often draw your child's growth curve on a growth chart. Children with growth hormone deficiency have a slow or flat rate of growth. The slow growth may not show up until a child is 2 or 3 years old.; The child will be much shorter than most children of the same age and sex. The child will still have normal body proportions, but may be chubby. The child's face often looks younger than other children of the same age. The child will have normal intelligence in most cases.; In older children, puberty may come late or may not come at all, depending on the cause.","The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain. This gland controls the body's balance of hormones. It also makes growth hormone. This hormone causes a child to grow.; Growth hormone deficiency may be present at birth. Growth hormone deficiency may be the result of a medical condition. Severe brain injury may also cause growth hormone deficiency.; Children with physical defects of the face and skull, such as cleft lip or cleft palate, may have decreased growth hormone level.; Most of the time, the cause of growth hormone deficiency is unknown."
001177,Male pattern baldness,Alopecia in men; Baldness - male; Hair loss in men; Androgenetic alopecia,"The typical pattern of male baldness begins at the hairline in the front of the head. The hairline gradually moves backward (recedes) and forms an ""M"" shape. A circular area on the back of the head (vertex) often thins and expands in size over time. Eventually the hair becomes finer, shorter, and thinner, and creates a U-shaped (or horseshoe) pattern of hair around the sides of the head and a bald area on the back of the head.","Male pattern baldness is related to your genes and male sex hormones. It usually follows a pattern of receding hairline and hair thinning on the crown.; Each strand of hair sits in a tiny hole (cavity) in the skin called a follicle. Generally, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair. Eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair. The follicles remain alive, which suggests that it is still possible to grow new hair."
001178,Simple goiter,Goiter - simple; Endemic goiter; Colloidal goiter; Nontoxic goiter,"The main symptom is an enlarged thyroid gland. The size may range from a single small nodule to a large mass at the front of the neck.; Some people with a simple goiter may have symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland.; In rare cases, an enlarged thyroid can put pressure on the windpipe (trachea) and food tube (esophagus). This can lead to:; Breathing difficulties (with very large goiters), especially when lying flat on the back or when reaching up with your arms; Cough; Hoarseness; Swallowing difficulties, especially with solid food; Pain in the area of the thyroid","The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system. It is located at the front of the neck just above where your collarbones meet. The gland makes the hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called metabolism.; Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter. The body needs iodine to produce thyroid hormone. If you do not have enough iodine in your diet, the thyroid gets larger to try and capture all the iodine it can, so it can make the right amount of thyroid hormone. So, a goiter can be a sign the thyroid is not able to make enough thyroid hormone. The use of iodized salt in the United States prevents a lack of iodine in the diet for people who use it.; Other causes of goiter include:; Simple goiters are more common in:; The body's immune system attacking the thyroid gland (autoimmune problem); Certain medicines (lithium, amiodarone); Infections (rare); Cigarette smoking; Eating very large amounts of certain foods (soy, peanuts, or vegetables in the broccoli and cabbage family); Toxic nodular goiter, an enlarged thyroid gland that has a small growth or many growths called nodules, which produce too much thyroid hormone; People over age 40; People with a family history of goiter; People who are born and raised in areas with iodine deficiency; Women"
001179,High potassium level,Hyperkalemia; Potassium - high; High blood potassium,"There are often no symptoms with a high level of potassium. When symptoms do occur, they may include:; Chest pain; Difficulty breathing; Nausea or vomiting; Palpitations (irregular or abnormal-feeling heartbeats); Slow, weak, or irregular pulse; Sudden collapse, when the heartbeat gets too slow or even stops","Potassium is needed for cells to function properly. You get potassium through food. Your kidneys remove excess potassium through the urine to keep a proper balance of this mineral in your body.; If your kidneys are not working well, they may not be able to remove the proper amount of potassium. As a result, potassium can build up in the blood. This buildup can also be due to:; Addison disease -- Disease in which the adrenal glands do not make enough hormones, reducing the kidneys' ability to remove potassium from the body; Burns over large areas of the body; Certain blood pressure lowering drugs, most often angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs); Damage to muscle and other cells from certain illicit street drugs, alcohol abuse, untreated seizures, surgery, crush injuries and falls, certain chemotherapies, or certain infections; Disorders that cause red blood cells to burst (hemolytic anemia); Severe bleeding from the stomach or intestines; Taking extra potassium, such as salt substitutes or supplements; Tumors"
001181,Acidosis,,"Metabolic acidosis symptoms depend on the underlying disease or condition. Metabolic acidosis itself causes rapid and deep breathing as your body tries to compensate for it. Confusion or lethargy may also occur. Severe metabolic acidosis can lead to shock or death. In some situations, metabolic acidosis can be a mild, ongoing (chronic) condition.; Respiratory acidosis symptoms can include:; Confusion; Fatigue; Lethargy; Shortness of breath; Sleepiness","The kidneys and lungs maintain the balance (proper pH level) of chemicals called acids and bases in the body. Acidosis occurs when acid builds up or when bicarbonate (a base) is lost. Acidosis is classified as either respiratory or metabolic acidosis.; Respiratory acidosis develops when there is too much carbon dioxide (an acid) in the body. This type of acidosis is usually caused when the body is unable to remove enough carbon dioxide through breathing. Other names for respiratory acidosis are hypercapnic acidosis and carbon dioxide acidosis. Causes of respiratory acidosis include:; Metabolic acidosis develops when too much acid is produced in the body. It can also occur when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body. There are several types of metabolic acidosis:; Lactic acidosis is a buildup of lactic acid. Lactic acid is mainly produced in muscle cells and red blood cells. It forms when the body breaks down carbohydrates to use for energy when oxygen levels are low. This can be caused by:; Compensated acidosis occurs when the body returns the acid-base balance to near normal in cases of acidosis, but bicarbonate and carbon dioxide levels remain abnormal.; Chest deformities, such as kyphosis; Chest injuries; Chest muscle weakness; Long-term (chronic) lung disease; Neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or muscular dystrophy; Overuse of sedative drugs, causing decreased respiration; Acute lung disease, such as severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with severe medical illness; Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled diabetes (usually type 1 diabetes).; Hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea.; Kidney disease (uremia, distal renal tubular acidosis or proximal renal tubular acidosis).; Lactic acidosis.; Poisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol.; Severe dehydration.; Cancer; Carbon monoxide poisoning; Drinking too much alcohol; Exercising vigorously for a very long time; Liver failure; Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia); Medicines, such as salicylates, metformin, anti-retrovirals; MELAS (a very rare genetic mitochondrial disorder that affects energy production); Prolonged lack of oxygen from shock, heart failure, or severe anemia; Seizures; Sepsis -- severe illness due to infection with bacteria or other germs; Severe asthma"

It affects mostly males. Some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races.; Some cases of ALD occur when the gene changes on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited.; The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body.; There are three major categories of disease:; Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8); Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life; Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones"
001183,Alkalosis,,"Symptoms of alkalosis can include any of the following:; Confusion (can progress to stupor or coma); Hand tremor; Lightheadedness; Muscle twitching; Nausea, vomiting; Numbness or tingling in the face, hands, or feet; Prolonged muscle spasms (tetany)","The kidneys and lungs maintain the proper balance (proper pH level) of chemicals called acids and bases in the body. Decreased carbon dioxide (an acid) level or increased bicarbonate (a base) level makes the body too alkaline, a condition called alkalosis. There are different types of alkalosis. These are described below.; Respiratory alkalosis is caused by a low carbon dioxide level in the blood. This can be due to:; Metabolic alkalosis is caused by too much bicarbonate in the blood. It can also occur due to certain kidney diseases.; Hypochloremic alkalosis is caused by an extreme lack or loss of chloride, such as from prolonged vomiting.; Hypokalemic alkalosis is caused by the kidneys' response to an extreme lack or loss of potassium. This can occur from taking certain water pills (diuretics).; Compensated alkalosis occurs when the body returns the acid-base balance to near normal in cases of alkalosis, but bicarbonate and carbon dioxide levels remain abnormal.; Fever; Being at a high altitude; Lack of oxygen; Liver disease; Lung disease, which causes you to breathe faster (hyperventilate); Aspirin poisoning"

About 10% of cases are passed down through families.
001187,Fluid imbalance,Water imbalance; Fluid imbalance - dehydration; Fluid buildup; Fluid overload; Volume overload; Loss of fluids; Edema - fluid imbalance; Hyponatremia - fluid imbalance; Hypernatremia - fluid imbalance; Hypokalemia - fluid imbalance; Hyperkalemia - fluid imbalance,,"Your body is constantly losing water through breathing, sweating, and urinating. If you do not take in enough fluids or water, you become dehydrated.; Your body may also have a hard time getting rid of fluids. As a result, excess fluid builds up in the body. This is called fluid overload (volume overload). This can lead to edema (excess fluid in the skin and tissues).; Many medical problems can cause fluid imbalance:; Often, in people with fluid imbalance, a high or low blood level of sodium or potassium is present as well.; Medicines can also affect fluid balance. The most common are water pills (diuretics) to treat blood pressure, heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease.; After surgery, the body often retains large amounts of fluid for several days, causing swelling of the body.; In people with heart failure, fluid collects in the lungs, liver, blood vessels, and body tissues because the heart does a poor job of pumping it to the kidneys.; When the kidneys do not work well because of long-term (chronic) kidney disease, the body cannot get rid of unneeded fluids.; The body may lose too much fluid due to diarrhea, vomiting, severe blood loss, or high fever.; Lack of a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) can cause the kidneys to get rid of too much fluid. This results in extreme thirst, dehydration, and chemical imbalance of the blood."

The condition is often discovered when blood tests are done for another medical reason.; Parathyroid adenomas are the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands), which leads to an increased blood calcium level. Symptoms may include any of the following:; Confusion; Constipation; Lack of energy (lethargy); Muscle pain; Nausea or decreased appetite; Urinating more often at night; Weak bones or fractures","The parathyroid glands in the neck help regulate calcium absorption, use, and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones.; Parathyroid adenomas are common. Most parathyroid adenomas do not have an identified cause. Sometimes a genetic problem is the cause. This is more common if the diagnosis is made when you are young.; Parathyroid adenomas may occur in people without a family history of the disease, or as part of 3 inherited syndromes:; In people with an inherited syndrome, a changed (variant) gene is passed down through the family. You only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the condition.; Conditions that stimulate the parathyroid glands to get bigger can also cause an adenoma. These include:; Women over age 60 have the highest risk for developing this condition. Radiation to the head or neck also increases the risk.; Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I; Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) IIA; Isolated familial hyperparathyroidism; In MEN I, problems in the parathyroid glands occur, as well as tumors in the pituitary gland and pancreas.; In MEN IIA, overactivity of the parathyroid glands occurs, along with tumors in the adrenal or thyroid gland.; Genetic disorders; Taking the medicine lithium; Chronic kidney disease"

It is important for healthy bones.; Parathyroid hyperplasia may occur in people without a family history of the disease, or as part of 3 inherited syndromes:; In people with an inherited syndrome, a changed (variant) gene is passed down through the family. You only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the condition.; Parathyroid hyperplasia that isn't part of an inherited syndrome is much more common. It occurs due to other medical conditions. The most common conditions that can cause parathyroid hyperplasia are chronic kidney disease and chronic vitamin D deficiency. In both cases, the parathyroid glands become enlarged because vitamin D and calcium levels are too low.; Multiple endocrine neoplasia I (MEN I); MEN IIA; Isolated familial hyperparathyroidism; In MEN I, problems in the parathyroid glands occur, as well as tumors in the pituitary gland and pancreas.; In MEN IIA, overactivity of the parathyroid glands occurs, along with tumors in the adrenal or thyroid gland."

The chance a woman can get pregnant begins to decrease around age 35 (and especially after age 40). The age when fertility starts to decline varies from woman to woman.; Infertility problems and miscarriage rates increase significantly after 35 years of age. There are now options for early egg retrieval and storage for women in their 20's. This may help ensure a successful pregnancy if childbearing is delayed until after age 35. This is an expensive option. However, women who know they will need to delay childbearing may consider it.; A fertilized egg or embryo does not survive once it attaches to the lining of the womb (uterus).; The fertilized egg does not attach to the lining of the uterus.; The eggs cannot move from the ovaries to the womb.; The ovaries have problems producing healthy eggs.; Autoimmune disorders, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS); Birth defects that affect the reproductive tract; Cancer or tumor; Clotting disorders; Diabetes; Drinking too much alcohol; Exercising too much; Eating disorders or poor nutrition; Growths (such as fibroids or polyps) in the uterus and cervix; Medicines such as chemotherapy drugs; Failure to ovulate; Being overweight or underweight; Older age; Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); Pelvic infection resulting in scarring or swelling of fallopian tubes (hydrosalpinx) or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID); Scarring from sexually transmitted infection, abdominal surgery or endometriosis; Smoking; Surgery to prevent pregnancy (tubal ligation) or failure of tubal ligation reversal (reanastomosis); Thyroid disease; Decreased number of sperm; Blockage that prevents the sperm from being released; Defects in the sperm; Birth defects; Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation; Exposure to high heat for prolonged periods; Heavy use of alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine; Benign pituitary tumor (causing high blood level of prolactin); Diabetes (uncontrolled); Hypogonadism causing low levels of the male hormone testosterone; Impotence; Infection; Medicines such as cimetidine, spironolactone, and nitrofurantoin; Obesity; Older age; Retrograde ejaculation; Scarring from sexually transmitted infections (STIs), injury, or surgery; Smoking; Toxins in the environment; Vasectomy or failure of vasectomy reversal; History of testicular infection from mumps"
001193,Neonatal hypothyroidism,Cretinism; Congenital hypothyroidism,"Most affected infants have few or no symptoms. This is because their thyroid hormone level is only slightly low. Infants with severe hypothyroidism often have a unique appearance, including:; This appearance often develops as the disease gets worse.; The child may also have:; Dull look; Puffy face; Thick tongue that sticks out; Poor feeding, choking episodes; Constipation; Dry, brittle hair; Hoarse cry; Jaundice (skin and whites of the eyes look yellow); Lack of muscle tone (floppy infant); Low hairline; Short height; Sleepiness; Sluggishness","The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system. It is located at the front of the neck, just above where the collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called metabolism.; Hypothyroidism in the newborn may be caused by:; A thyroid gland that is not fully developed is the most common defect. Girls are affected twice as often as boys.; A missing or poorly developed thyroid gland; A pituitary gland that does not stimulate the thyroid gland; Thyroid hormones that are poorly formed or do not work; Medicines the mother took during pregnancy; Lack of iodine in the mother's diet during pregnancy; Antibodies made by the mother's body that block the baby's thyroid function"
001195,Hypogonadism,Gonadal deficiency; Testicular failure; Ovarian failure; Testosterone - hypogonadism,"Girls who have hypogonadism will not begin menstruating. Hypogonadism can affect their breast development and height. If hypogonadism occurs after puberty, symptoms in women include:; In boys, hypogonadism affects muscle, beard, genital and voice development. It also leads to growth problems. In men the symptoms are:; If a pituitary or other brain tumor is present (central hypogonadism), there may be:; The most common tumors affecting the pituitary are craniopharyngioma in children and prolactinoma adenomas in adults.; Hot flashes; Energy and mood changes; Menstruation becomes irregular or stops; Breast enlargement; Muscle loss; Decreased interest in sex (low libido); Headaches or vision loss; Milky breast discharge (from a prolactinoma, a tumor that produces the hormone prolactin); Symptoms of other hormonal deficiencies (such as hypothyroidism)","The cause of hypogonadism can be primary (testes or ovaries) or secondary (problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus). In primary hypogonadism, the ovaries or testes themselves do not function properly. Causes of primary hypogonadism include:; The most common genetic disorders that cause primary hypogonadism are Turner syndrome (in women) and Klinefelter syndrome (in men).; If you already have other autoimmune disorders you may be at higher risk for autoimmune damage to the gonads. These can include disorders that affect the liver, adrenal glands, and thyroid glands, as well as type 1 diabetes.; In central hypogonadism, the centers in the brain that control the gonads (hypothalamus and pituitary) do not function properly. Causes of central hypogonadism include:; A genetic cause of central hypogonadism is Kallmann syndrome. Many people with this condition also have a decreased sense of smell.; Menopause is the most common reason for hypogonadism. It is normal in all women and occurs on average around age 50. Testosterone levels decrease in men as they age, as well.

This means that a child must receive a non-working gene from each parent to develop the disorder.; There are many different types of enzyme-related defects of the red blood cell that can cause hemolytic anemia. PKD is the second most common cause, after glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.; PKD is found in people of all ethnic backgrounds. But, certain populations, such as the Amish, are more likely to develop the condition."
001198,Krabbe disease,Globoid cell leukodystrophy; Galactosylcerebrosidase deficiency; Galactosylceramidase deficiency,"Symptoms of early-onset Krabbe disease are:; With late onset Krabbe disease, vision problems may appear first, followed by walking difficulties and rigid muscles. Symptoms vary from person to person. Other symptoms may also occur.; Changing muscle tone from floppy to rigid; Hearing loss that leads to deafness; Failure to thrive; Feeding difficulties; Irritability and sensitivity to loud sounds; Severe seizures (may begin at a very early age); Unexplained fevers; Vision loss that leads to blindness; Vomiting","A defect in the GALC gene causes Krabbe disease. People with this gene defect do not make enough of a substance (enzyme) called galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase (galactosylceramidase).; The body needs this enzyme to make myelin. Myelin surrounds and protects nerve fibers. Without this enzyme, myelin breaks down, brain cells die, and nerves in the brain and other body areas do not work properly.; Krabbe disease can develop at various ages:; Krabbe disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry the nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. It is an autosomal recessive disorder.; This condition is very rare. It is most common among people of Scandinavian descent.; Early-onset Krabbe disease appears in the first months of life. Most children with this form of the disease die before they reach age 2.; Late-onset Krabbe disease begins in late childhood or early adolescence."
001199,Homocystinuria,Cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency; CBS deficiency; HCY,"Newborn infants appear healthy.

This means that the child must inherit a non-working copy of the gene from each parent to be seriously affected.; People with homocystinuria have several physical features in common with Marfan syndrome, including skeletal and eye changes."
001200,Alkaptonuria,AKU; Alkaptonuria; Homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency; Alkaptonuric ochronosis,"Urine in an infant's diaper may darken and can turn almost black after several hours. However, many people with this condition may not know they have it. The disease is most often discoveredÂ in mid-adulthood (around age 40), when joint and other problems occur.; Symptoms may include:; Arthritis (especially of the spine) that gets worse over time; Darkening of the ear; Dark spots on the white of the eye and cornea","A defect in the HGD gene causes alkaptonuria.; The gene defect makes the body unable to properly break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. As a result, a substance called homogentisic acid builds up in the skin and other body tissues. The acid leaves the body through the urine. The urine turns brownish-black when it mixes with air.; Alkaptonuria is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease."
001201,Hartnup disorder,,"Most people show no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they most often appear in childhood and may include:; Diarrhea; Mood changes; Nervous system (neurologic) problems, such as abnormal muscle tone and uncoordinated movements; Red, scaly skin rash, usually when skin is exposed to sunlight; Sensitivity to light (photosensitivity); Short stature",Hartnup disorder is a metabolic condition involving amino acids. It is an inherited condition. This condition occurs due to non-working copies of the SLC6A19 gene. A child must inherit a copy of the variant gene from both parents to be seriously affected.; The condition most often appears between ages 3 to 9 years.
001202,Hypothalamic dysfunction,Hypothalamic syndromes,"Symptoms are usually due to the hormones or brain signals that are missing. In children, there may be growth problems, either too much or too little growth. In other children, puberty occurs too early or too late.; Tumor symptoms may include headache or loss of vision.; If the thyroid is affected, there may be symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). Symptoms may include feeling cold all the time, constipation, fatigue, or weight gain, among others.; If the adrenal glands are affected, there may be symptoms of low adrenal function. Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, poor appetite, weight loss, and lack of interest in activities.","The hypothalamus helps keep the body's internal functions in balance. It helps regulate:; Another important function of the hypothalamus is to control the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland at the base of the brain. It lies just below the hypothalamus.

This means it can be passed down through families. The affected gene is on the X chromosome. Boys are most often affected because they inherit the X chromosome from their mothers. Their mothers do not have symptoms of the disease, but they carry a nonworking copy of the gene.; MPS II is caused by a lack of the enzyme iduronate sulfatase. Without this enzyme, chains of sugar molecules build up in various body tissues, causing damage.; The early-onset, severe form of the disease begins shortly after age 2. A late-onset, mild form causes less severe symptoms to appear later in life."
001204,Mucopolysaccharidosis type I,Alpha-L-iduronate deficiency; Mucopolysaccharidosis type I; Severe MPS I; Attenuated MPS I; MPS I H; MPS I S; Hurler syndrome; Scheie syndrome; Hurler-Scheie syndrome; MPS 1 H/S; Lysosomal storage disease - mucopolysaccharidosis type I,"Symptoms of MPS I most often appear from ages 3 to 8 years. Children with severe MPS I develop symptoms earlier than those with the less severe form.; Some of the symptoms include:; Abnormal bones in the spine; Inability to fully open the fingers (claw hand); Cloudy corneas; Deafness; Halted growth; Heart valve problems; Joint disease, including stiffness; Intellectual disability that gets worse over time in severe MPS I; Thick, coarse facial features with low nasal bridge","MPS I is inherited, which means that your parents typically pass the disease on to you. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.; People with MPS I do not make an enzyme called lysosomal alpha-L-iduronidase. This enzyme helps break down long chains of sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans. These molecules are found throughout the body, often in mucus and in fluid around the joints.; Without the enzyme, glycosaminoglycans build up and damage organs, including the heart. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. The mild form is called attenuated MPS I and the severe form is called severe MPS I."
001205,Metachromatic leukodystrophy,MLD; Arylsulfatase A deficiency; Leukodystrophy - metachromatic; ARSA deficiency,"Symptoms of MLD may include any of the following:; Abnormally high or decreased muscle tone, or abnormal muscle movements, any of which may cause problems walking or frequent falls; Behavior problems, personality changes, irritability; Decreased mental function; Difficulty swallowing; Inability to perform normal tasks; Incontinence; Poor school performance; Seizures; Speech difficulties, slurring","MLD is usually caused by the lack of an important enzyme called arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Because this enzyme is missing, chemicals called sulfatides build up in the body and damage the nervous system, kidneys, gallbladder, and other organs. In particular, the chemicals damage the protective sheaths that surround nerve cells.; The disease is passed down through families (inherited). You must get a copy of the defective gene from both of your parents to have the disease. Parents can each have the defective gene, but not have MLD. A person with one defective gene is called a ""carrier.""; Children who inherit only one defective gene from one parent will be a carrier, but usually will not develop MLD. When two carriers have a child, there is a 1 in 4 chance that the child will get both genes and have MLD.; There are three forms of MLD. The forms are based on when the symptoms begin:; Late infantile MLD symptoms usually begin by ages 1 to 2.; Juvenile MLD symptoms usually begin between ages 4 and 12.; Adult (and late-stage juvenile MLD) symptoms may occur between age 14 and adulthood (over age 16), but may begin as late as the 40s or 50s."

They include:; Abnormal development of bones, including the spine; Bell-shaped chest with ribs flared out at the bottom; Cloudy cornea; Coarse facial features; Enlarged liver; Heart murmur; Hernia in the groin; Hypermobile joints; Knock-knees; Large head; Loss of nerve function below the neck; Short stature with a particularly short trunk; Widely spaced teeth","MPS IV is an inherited disorder. This means it is typically passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an autosomal recessive trait.; There are two forms of MPS IV: type A and type B.; The body needs these enzymes to break down long strands of sugar molecules called keratan sulfate. In both types, abnormally large amounts of glycosaminoglycans build up in the body. This can damage bodily organs.; Type A is caused by a defect in the GALNS gene. People with type A do not have an enzyme called N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase.; Type B is caused by a defect in the GLB1 gene. People with type B do not produce enough of an enzyme called beta-galactosidase."
001207,Niemann-Pick disease,NPD; Sphingomyelinase deficiency; Lipid storage disorder - Niemann-Pick disease; Lysosomal storage disease - Niemann-Pick,"Symptoms vary. Other health conditions may cause similar symptoms. The early stages of the disease may only cause a few symptoms. A person may never have all symptoms.; Type A usually begins in the first few months of life. Symptoms may include:; Type B symptoms are usually milder. They occur in late childhood or the teenage years. Abdominal swelling may occur in young children. There is almost no brain and nervous system involvement, such as loss of motor skills. Some children may have repeated respiratory infections.; Types C and C1 usually affects school-age children. However, it may occur any time between early infancy to adulthood. Symptoms may include:; Abdominal (belly area) swelling within 3 to 6 months; Cherry red spot at the back of the eye (on the retina); Feeding difficulties; Loss of early motor skills (gets worse over time); Difficulty moving limbs that may lead to unsteady gait, clumsiness, walking problems; Enlarged spleen; Enlarged liver; Jaundice at (or shortly after) birth; Learning difficulties and intellectual decline; Seizures; Slurred, irregular speech; Sudden loss of muscle tone that may lead to falls; Tremors; Trouble moving the eyes up and down","NPD types A and B occur when cells in the body do not have an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). This substance helps break down (metabolize) a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell in the body.; If ASM is missing or does not work properly, sphingomyelin builds up inside cells. This kills your cells and makes it hard for organs to work properly.; Type A occurs in all races and ethnicities. It is more common in the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish population.; Type C occurs when the body cannot properly break down cholesterol and other fats (lipids). This leads to too much cholesterol in the liver and spleen and too much of other lipids in the brain. Type C is most common among Puerto Ricans of Spanish descent.; Type C1 is a variant of type C. It involves a defect that interferes with how cholesterol moves between brain cells. This type has only been seen in French Canadian people in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia."

They often start with severe abdominal pain followed by vomiting and constipation. Being out in the sun can cause pain, sensations of heat, blistering, and skin redness and swelling. Blisters heal slowly, often with scarring or skin color changes. The scarring may be disfiguring. Urine may turn red or brown after an attack.; Other symptoms include:; Attacks can sometimes be life threatening, producing:; Abdominal pain or cramping (only in some forms of the disease); Sensitivity to light that can cause rashes, blistering, and scarring of the skin (photodermatitis); Problems with the nervous system and muscles (seizures, mental disturbances, nerve damage); Muscle pain; Muscle weakness or paralysis; Numbness or tingling; Pain in the arms or legs; Pain in the back; Personality changes or psychosis; Low blood pressure; Severe electrolyte imbalances; Shock","Normally, the body makes heme in a multi-step process. Porphyrins are made during several steps of this process. People with porphyria are lacking certain enzymes needed for this process. This causes abnormal amounts of porphyrins or related chemicals to build up in the body.; There are many different forms of porphyria. The most common type is porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT).; Drugs, infection, alcohol, and hormones such as estrogen may trigger attacks of certain types of porphyria.; Porphyria is inherited. This means the disorder is passed down through families."

A decline in learning ability typically occurs between ages 2 and 6. The child may have normal growth during the first few years, but final height is below average. Delayed development is followed by worsening mental status.; Other symptoms may include:; Behavioral problems, including hyperactivity; Coarse facial features with heavy eyebrows that meet in the middle of the face above the nose; Chronic diarrhea; Enlarged liver and spleen; Sleep difficulties; Stiff joints that may not extend fully; Vision problems and hearing loss; Walking problems","MPS III is an inherited disorder. This means it is typically passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an autosomal recessive trait.; MPS III occurs when the enzymes needed to break down the heparan sulfate sugar chain are missing or defective.; There are four main types of MPS III. The type a person has depends on which enzyme is affected.; Type A is caused by a defect in the SGSH gene and is the most severe form. People with this type do not have a normal form of the enzyme called heparan N-sulfatase.; Type B is caused by a defect in the NAGLU gene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase.; Type C is caused by a defect in the HGSNAT gene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase.; Type D is caused by a defect in the GNS gene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase."

If the tumors block the flow of spinal fluid, headaches and sleepiness may result from fluid collecting in the brain (hydrocephalus).; Some people can have seizures as a result of brain tumors. Other people may develop precocious puberty from a change in pituitary gland function.; Euphoric ""high"" sensations; Failure to thrive (lack of normal growth in children); Headache; Hyperactivity; Loss of body fat and appetite (cachexia)","The exact cause of hypothalamic tumors is not known. It is likely that they result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.; In children, most hypothalamic tumors are gliomas. Gliomas are a common type of brain tumor that result from the abnormal growth of glial cells, which support nerve cells. Gliomas can occur at any age. They are often more aggressive in adults than in children.; In adults, tumors in the hypothalamus are more likely cancer that has spread from another organ.; People with neurofibromatosis (a hereditary condition) are at increased risk for this type of tumor. People who have undergone radiation therapy are at increased risk of developing tumors in general."
001212,Diabetes and eye disease,Retinopathy - diabetic; Photocoagulation - retina; Diabetic retinopathy,"Most often, diabetic retinopathy has no symptoms until the damage to your eyes is severe. This is because damage to much of the retina can occur before your vision is affected.; Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy include:; Many people with early diabetic retinopathy have no symptoms before bleeding occurs in the eye. This is why everyone with diabetes should have regular eye exams.; Blurred vision and slow vision loss over time; Floaters; Shadows or missing areas of vision; Trouble seeing at night","Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage from diabetes to blood vessels of the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals, which are sent to the brain.; Diabetic retinopathy is a main cause of decreased vision or blindness in Americans ages 20 to 74 years. People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at risk for this condition. Some people who have type 2 diabetes that develops slowly already have eye damage when they are first diagnosed.; The chance of developing retinopathy and having a more severe form is higher when:; If you already have damage to the blood vessels in your eye, some types of exercise can make the problem worse. Check with your health care provider before starting an exercise program.; Other eye problems that can occur in people with diabetes include:; High blood sugar or rapid changes in blood sugar level often cause blurred vision that is usually brief and temporary. This is because the lens in the middle of the eye cannot change shape when it has too much sugar and water in the lens. This is not the same problem as diabetic retinopathy.; You have had diabetes for a long time.; Your blood sugar (glucose) has been poorly controlled.; You also smoke or you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol.; Cataract -- Cloudiness of the eye lens.; Glaucoma -- Increased pressure in the eye that can lead to blindness.; Macular edema -- Blurry vision due to fluid leaking into the area of the retina that provides sharp central vision.; Retinal detachment -- Scarring that may cause part of the retina to pull away from the back of your eyeball."
001213,Thyroid cancer,Tumor - thyroid; Cancer - thyroid; Nodule - thyroid cancer; Papillary thyroid carcinoma; Medullary thyroid carcinoma; Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma; Follicular thyroid cancer,"Symptoms vary depending on the type of thyroid cancer, but may include:; Cough; Difficulty swallowing; Enlargement of the thyroid gland; Hoarseness or changing voice; Neck swelling; Thyroid lump (nodule)","Thyroid cancer can occur in people of any age.; Radiation to the thyroid increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Exposure may occur from:; Other risk factors are a family history of thyroid cancer and chronic goiter (enlarged thyroid). Being overweight or having obesity may be a risk factor for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.; There are several types of thyroid cancer:; Radiation therapy to the neck (especially in childhood); Radiation exposure from nuclear plant disasters; Anaplastic carcinoma (also called giant and spindle cell cancer) is the most dangerous form of thyroid cancer. It is rare, and spreads quickly.; Follicular carcinoma is more likely to come back and spread.; Medullary carcinoma is a cancer of non-thyroid hormone-producing cells that are normally present in the thyroid gland. This form of thyroid cancer tends to occur in families.; Papillary carcinoma is the most common type, and it usually affects women of childbearing age. It spreads slowly and is the least dangerous type of thyroid cancer."
001214,Diabetes,Diabetes - type 1; Diabetes - type 2; Diabetes - gestational; Type 1 diabetes; Type 2 diabetes; Gestational diabetes; Diabetes mellitus,"A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:; Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.; Symptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop over a short period, usually weeks to months. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.; After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include:; Blurry vision; Excess thirst; Fatigue; Frequent urination; Hunger; Weight loss; Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, cataracts, and blindness; Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot; Damage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction; Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure; Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections; Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke","Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both.; To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed:; People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:; There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:; Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes.; If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease.; A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.; An organ in the upper abdomen, below and behind the stomach, called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.; Their pancreas does not make enough insulin; Their cells do not respond to insulin normally (also called insulin resistance); Both of the above; Type 1 diabetes is less common, accounting for 5% to 10% of people with diabetes in the United States. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin are damaged by an immune process and stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause of the immune process is unknown.; Type 2 diabetes is more common, accounting for 90% to 95% of people with diabetes in the United States. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.; There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Examples include LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a variant of type 1 diabetes), MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young), and diabetes due to other illnesses."
001215,Hyperparathyroidism,Parathyroid-related hypercalcemia; Osteoporosis - hyperparathyroidism; Bone thinning - hyperparathyroidism; Osteopenia - hyperparathyroidism; High calcium level - hyperparathyroidism; Chronic kidney disease - hyperparathyroidism; Kidney failure - hyperparathyroidism; Overactive parathyroid; Vitamin D deficiency - hyperparathyroidism,"Hyperparathyroidism is often diagnosed by common blood tests before symptoms occur.; Symptoms are mostly caused by damage to organs from high calcium level in the blood, or by the loss of calcium from the bones. Symptoms can include:; Bone pain or tenderness; Depression and forgetfulness; Feeling tired, ill, and weak; Fragile bones of the limbs and spine that can break easily; Increased amount of urine produced and needing to urinate more often; Kidney stones; Nausea and loss of appetite","There are 4 tiny parathyroid glands in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland.; The parathyroid glands help regulate calcium absorption, use and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones.; When the blood calcium level is too low, the body responds by making more PTH. This causes the calcium level in the blood to rise.; If one or more of the parathyroid glands grow larger, it may lead to too much PTH. Most often, the cause is a benign tumor of the parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenoma). These benign tumors are common and happen without a known cause.; Medical conditions that cause low blood calcium or increased phosphate can also lead to hyperparathyroidism. Common conditions include:; The disease is most common in people over age 60, but it can also occur in younger adults. Hyperparathyroidism in childhood is very unusual.; Women are more likely to be affected than men.; Radiation to the head and neck increases the risk.; Some genetic syndromes (multiple endocrine neoplasia I) make it more likely to have hyperparathyroidism.; In very rare cases, hyperparathyroidism is caused by parathyroid cancer.; Conditions that make it hard for the body to remove phosphate; Kidney damage or failure; Not enough calcium in the diet; Too much calcium lost in the urine; Vitamin D disorders (may occur in children who do not eat a variety of foods, and in older adults who do not get enough sunlight on their skin or who have poor absorption of vitamin D from food such as after bariatric surgery); Problems absorbing nutrients from food"
001216,Macroamylasemia,,Macroamylasemia does not cause symptoms.,"Macroamylase is a substance that consists of an enzyme, called amylase, attached to a protein. Because it is large, macroamylase is filtered very slowly from the blood by the kidneys.; Most people with macroamylasemia do not have a serious disease that is causing it, but the condition has been associated with:; Celiac disease; Lymphoma; HIV infection; Monoclonal gammopathy; Rheumatoid arthritis; Ulcerative colitis"
001217,McCune-Albright syndrome,Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia,"The main symptom of McCune-Albright syndrome is early puberty in girls. Menstrual periods may begin in early childhood, long before the breasts or pubic hair develop (which normally occur first). The average age that symptoms appear is 3 years old. However, puberty and menstrual bleeding have occurred as early as 4 to 6 months in girls.; Early sexual development may also occur in boys, but not as often as in girls.; Other symptoms include:; Bone fractures; Deformities of the bones in the face; Gigantism; Irregular, large patchy cafÃ© au lait spots","McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by changes in the GNAS gene. A small number, but not all, of the person's cells contain this faulty gene (mosaicism).; This disease is not inherited."
001218,Absent menstrual periods - primary,Primary amenorrhea; No periods - primary; Absent periods - primary; Absent menses - primary; Absence of periods - primary,A female with amenorrhea will have no menstrual flow. She may haveÂ other signs of puberty.,"Most girls begin their periods between ages 9 and 18. The average is around 12 years old. If no periods have occurred when a girl is older than 15, further testing may be needed. The need is more urgent if she has gone through other normal changes that occur during puberty.; Being born with incompletely formed genital or pelvic organs can lead to a lack of menstrual periods. Some of these defects include:; Hormones play a big role in a woman's menstrual cycle. Hormone problems can occur when:; Either of these problems may be due to:; In many cases, the cause of primary amenorrhea is not known.; Blockages or narrowing of the cervix; Hymen that has no opening; Missing uterus or vagina; Vaginal septum (a wall that divides the vagina into 2 sections); Changes occur to the parts of the brain where hormones that help manage the menstrual cycle are produced.; The ovaries are not working correctly.; Anorexia (loss of appetite) with low body mass index (BMI); Chronic or long-term illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis or heart disease; Genetic defects or disorders; Infections that occurred before or after the woman's birth; Other birth defects; Poor nutrition; Tumors"
001219,Absent menstrual periods - secondary,Amenorrhea - secondary; No periods - secondary; Absent periods - secondary; Absent menses - secondary; Absence of periods - secondary,"In addition to having no menstrual periods, other symptoms can include:; If amenorrhea is caused by a pituitary tumor, there may be other symptoms related to the tumor, such as vision loss and headache.; Breast size changes; Weight gain or weight loss; Discharge from the breast or change in breast size; Acne and increased hair growth in a male pattern; Vaginal dryness; Voice changes","Secondary amenorrhea can occur due to natural changes in the body. For example, the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy. Breastfeeding and menopause are also common, but natural causes.; Women who take birth control pills or who receive hormone shots such as Depo-Provera may not have any monthly bleeding. When they stop taking these hormones, their periods may not return for more than 6 months.; You are more likely to have absent periods if you:; Other causes include:; Also, procedures such as a dilation and curettage (D and C) can cause scar tissue to form. This tissue may cause a woman to stop menstruating. This is called Asherman syndrome. Scarring may also be caused by some severe pelvic infections.; Are obese; Exercise too much and for long periods of time; Have low body fat (less than 15% to 17%); Have severe anxiety or emotional distress; Lose a lot of weight suddenly (for example, from strict or extreme diets or after gastric bypass surgery); Drugs for cancer treatment; Medicines to treat schizophrenia or psychosis; Overactive thyroid gland; Pituitary tumors; Polycystic ovarian syndrome; Reduced function of the ovaries; Premature ovarian failure"
001220,Muscle disorder,Myopathic changes; Myopathy; Muscle problem,The main symptom is weakness.; Other symptoms include cramps and stiffness.,
001221,Volkmann contracture,Ischemic contracture - Volkmann; Compartment syndrome - Volkmann ischemic contracture; Volkmann's contracture,"Symptoms of Volkmann contracture affect the forearm, wrist, and hand. Symptoms may include:; Decreased sensation; Paleness of the skin; Muscle weakness and loss (atrophy); Deformity of the wrist, hand, and fingers that causes the hand to have a claw-like appearance","Volkmann contracture occurs when there is a lack of blood flow (ischemia) to the forearm. This occurs when there is increased pressure due to swelling, a condition calledÂ compartment syndrome.; Injury to the arm, including a crush injury or fracture, can lead to swelling that presses on blood vessels and decreases blood flow to the arm. A prolonged decrease in blood flow injures the nerves and muscles, causing them to become stiff (scarred) and shortened.; When the muscle shortens, it pulls on the joint at the end of the muscle just as it would if it were normally contracted. But because it is stiff, the joint remains bent and stuck. This condition is called a contracture.; In Volkmann contracture, the muscles of the forearm are severely injured. This leads to contracture deformities of the fingers, hand, and wrist.; There are three levels of severity in Volkmann contracture:; Conditions that can cause increased pressure in the forearm include:; Mild -- contracture of 2 or 3 fingers only, with no or limited loss of feeling.; Moderate -- all fingers are bent (flexed) and the thumb is stuck in the palm; the wrist may be stuck in a bent position, and there is usually loss of some feeling in the hand.; Severe -- all muscles in the forearm that both flex and extend the wrist and fingers are involved; this is a severely disabling condition. There is minimal movement of the fingers and wrist.; Animal bites; A forearm or elbow fracture; Bleeding disorders; Burns; Injection of certain medicines into the forearm; Injury of the blood vessels in the forearm; Surgery on the forearm; Excessive exercise -- this would not cause severe contractures"
001222,Baker cyst,Popliteal cyst; Bulge-knee; Baker's cyst,"In most cases, a person may have no symptoms. A large cyst may cause some discomfort or stiffness. There may be a painless or painful swelling behind the knee.; The cyst may feel like a water-filled balloon. Sometimes, the cyst may break open (rupture), causing pain, swelling, and bruising on the back of the knee and calf.; It is important to know whether pain or swelling is caused by a Baker cyst or a blood clot. A blood clot (deep venous thrombosis)Â can also cause pain, swelling, and bruising on the back of the knee and calf. A blood clot may be dangerous and requires medical attention right away.","A Baker cyst is caused by swelling in the knee. The swelling occurs due to an increase in synovial fluid. This fluid lubricates the knee joint. When pressure builds up, fluid squeezes into the back of the knee.; Baker cyst commonly occurs with:; A tear in the meniscal cartilage of the knee; Cartilage injuries; Knee arthritis (in older adults); Rheumatoid arthritis; Other knee problems that cause knee swelling and synovitis (inflammation of the joint); Gout"

001224,Compartment syndrome,Fracture - compartment syndrome; Surgery - compartment syndrome; Trauma - compartment syndrome; Muscle bruise - compartment syndrome; Fasciotomy - compartment syndrome,"Symptoms of compartment syndrome are not easy to detect. With an acute injury, the symptoms can become severe within a few hours.; Symptoms may include:; Pain that is much higher than expected with the injury; Severe pain that doesn't go away after taking pain medicine or raising the affected area; Decreased sensation, numbness, tingling, weakness of the affected area; Paleness of skin; Swelling or inability to move the affected part","Thick layers of tissue, called fascia, separate groups of muscles in the arms and legs from each other. Inside each layer of fascia is a confined space, called a compartment. The compartment includes the muscle tissue, nerves, and blood vessels. Fascia surrounds these structures, similar to the way in which insulation covers wires.; Fascia do not expand. Any swelling in a compartment will lead to increased pressure in that area. This raised pressure, presses the muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. If this pressure is high enough, blood flow to the compartment will be blocked. This can lead to permanent injury to the muscle and nerves. If the pressure lasts long enough, the muscles may die and the arm or leg will no longer work. Surgery or even amputation may be done to correct the problem.; Acute compartment syndrome may be caused by:; Exertional compartment syndrome can be caused by repetitive activities, such as running. The pressure in a compartment only increases during that activity and goes down after the activity is stopped. This condition is usually less limiting and does not lead to loss of function or limb. However, the pain can limit activity and endurance. There is usually no permanent injury to the limb.; Compartment syndrome is most common in the lower leg and forearm. It can also occur in the hand, foot, thigh, buttocks, and upper arm.; Trauma, such as a crush injury or surgery; Broken bone; Very bruised muscle; Severe sprain; A cast or bandage that is too tight; Loss of blood supply due to the use of a tourniquet or positioning during surgery"
001225,Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA),Hallervorden-Spatz disease; Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration; PKAN; NBIA,"NBIA mainly causes movement problems. Other symptoms may include:; Dementia; Difficulty speaking; Difficulty swallowing; Muscle problems such as rigidity or involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia); Seizures; Tremor; Vision loss, such as from retinitis pigmentosa; Weakness; Writhing movements; Toe walking",Symptoms of NBIA begin in childhood or adulthood.; There are 10 types of NBIA. Each type is caused by a different gene defect. The most common gene defect causes the disorder called PKAN (pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration).; People with all forms of NBIA have a buildup of iron in the basal ganglia. This is an area deep inside the brain. It helps control movement.
001227,TMJ disorders,TMD; Temporomandibular joint disorders; Temporomandibular muscle disorders; Costen's syndrome; Craniomandibular disorder; Temporomandibular disorder,"Symptoms associated with TMJ disorders may be:; Biting or chewing difficulty or discomfort; Clicking, popping, or grating sound when opening or closing the mouth; Dull, aching pain in the face; Earache; Headache; Jaw pain or tenderness of the jaw; Locking of the jaw; Difficulty opening or closing the mouth","There are 2 matching temporomandibular joints on each side of your head. They are located just in front of your ears. The abbreviation ""TMJ"" refers to the name of the joint, but it is often used to mean any disorders or symptoms of this region.; Many TMJ-related symptoms are caused by the effects of physical stress on the structures around the joint. These structures include:; For many people with temporomandibular joint disorders, the cause is unknown. Some causes given for this condition are not well-proven. They include:; Poor posture can also be an important factor in TMJ symptoms. For example, holding your head forward while looking at a computer all day strains the muscles of your face and neck.; Other factors that may make TMJ symptoms worse include poor diet and lack of sleep.; Many people end up having ""trigger points."" These are contracted muscles in your jaw, head, and neck. Trigger points can refer pain to other areas, causing a headache, earache, or toothache.; Other possible causes of TMJ-related symptoms include arthritis, fractures, dislocations, and structural problems present since birth.; Cartilage disk in the joint; Muscles of the jaw, face, and neck; Nearby ligaments, blood vessels, and nerves; Teeth; A bad bite or orthodontic braces.; Stress and tooth grinding. Many people with TMJ problems do not grind their teeth, and many who have been grinding their teeth for a long time do not have problems with their temporomandibular joint. For some people, the stress associated with this disorder may be caused by the pain, as opposed to being the cause of the problem."
001228,Clubfoot,Talipes equinovarus; Talipes,The physical appearance of the foot may vary. One or both feet may be affected.; The foot turns inward and downward at birth and is difficult to place in the correct position. The calf muscle and foot may be slightly smaller than normal.,"Clubfoot is the most common congenital disorder of the legs. It can range from mild and flexible to severe and rigid.; The cause is not known. Most often, it occurs by itself. But the condition may be passed down through families in some cases. Risk factors include a family history of the disorder and being male. Clubfoot can also occur as part of an underlying genetic syndrome, such as trisomy 18.; A related problem, called positional clubfoot, is not true clubfoot. It results from a normal foot positioned abnormally while the baby is in the womb. This problem is easily corrected after birth."
001229,Tendinitis,Calcific tendinitis; Bicipital tendinitis,"Symptoms of tendinitis may vary with activity or cause. Main symptoms may include:; Pain and tenderness along a tendon, usually near a joint; Pain at night; Pain that is worse with movement or activity; Stiffness in the morning","Tendinitis can occur as a result of injury orÂ overuse. Playing sports is a common cause. Tendinitis also can occur with aging as the tendon loses elasticity. Body-wide (systemic) diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, can also lead to tendinitis.; Tendinitis can occur in any tendon. Commonly affected sites include the:; Elbow; Heel (Achilles tendinitis); Knee; Shoulder; Thumb; Wrist"
001230,Bone tumor,Tumor - bone; Bone cancer; Primary bone tumor; Secondary bone tumor; Bone tumor - benign,"Symptoms of a bone tumor may include any of the following:; Some benign tumors have no symptoms.; Bone fracture, especially from slight injury (trauma); Bone pain, may be worse at night; Occasionally a mass and swelling can be felt at the tumor site","The cause of bone tumors is unknown. They often occur in areas of the bone that grow rapidly. Possible causes include:; In most cases, no specific cause is found.; Osteochondromas are the most common noncancerous (benign) bone tumors. They occur most often in young people between the ages of 10 and 20.; Cancers that start in the bones are called primary bone tumors. Bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or colon) are called secondary or metastatic bone tumors. They behave very differently from primary bone tumors.; Cancerous primary bone tumors include:; Cancers that most often spread to the bone are cancers of the:; These forms of cancer usually affect older people.; Bone cancer is more common in people who have a family history of cancers.; Genetic defects passed down through families; Radiation; Injury; Chondrosarcoma; Ewing sarcoma; Fibrosarcoma; Osteosarcoma; Breast; Kidney; Lung; Prostate; Thyroid"
001231,Bunions,Hallux valgus,"Symptoms may include:; You may have problems finding shoes that fit or shoes that do not cause pain.; Red, thickened skin along the inside edge at the base of the big toe.; A bony bump at the first toe joint, with decreased movement in the toe.; Pain over the joint, which pressure from shoes makes worse.; Big toe turned outward toward the other toes and may cross over the second toe. As a result, corns and calluses often develop where the first and second toes overlap.; Difficulty wearing regular shoes.","Bunions are more common in women than men. The problem can run in families. People born with abnormal alignment of the bones in their feet are more likely to form a bunion.; Wearing narrow-toed, high-heeled shoes may lead to the development of a bunion.; The condition may become painful as the bump gets worse. Extra bone and a fluid-filled sac can grow at the base of the big toe."
001232,Corns and calluses,Calluses and corns,"Symptoms may include:; Skin is thick and hardened.; Skin may be flaky and dry.; Hardened, thick skin areas are found on hands, feet, or other areas that may be rubbed or pressed.; The affected areas can be painful and may bleed.","Corns and calluses are caused by pressure or friction on skin. A corn is thickened skin on the top or side of a toe. Most of the time it is caused by bad-fitting shoes. A callus is thickened skin on your hands or the soles of your feet.; The thickening of the skin is a protective reaction. For example, farmers and rowers get calluses on their hands that prevent blisters from forming. People with bunions often develop a callus over the bunion because it rubs against the shoe.; Corns and calluses may be painful but are not serious problems for most people."
001233,Dupuytren contracture,Palmar fascial fibromatosis - Dupuytren; Flexion contracture - Dupuytren; Needle aponeurotomy - Dupuytren; Needle release - Dupuytren; Percutaneous needle fasciotomy - Dupuytren; Fasciotomy- Dupuytren; Enzyme injection - Dupuytren; Collagenase injection - Dupuytren; Fasciotomy - enzymatic - Dupuytren; Dupuytren's contracture,"One or both hands may be affected. The ring finger is affected most often, followed by the little, middle, and index fingers.; A small, nodule or lump develops in the tissue below the skin on the palm side of the hand. Over time, it thickens into a cord-like band. Usually, there is no pain. In rare cases, the tendons or joints become inflamed and painful. Other possible symptoms are itching, pressure, burning, or tension.; This is a condition that is mostly painless, but it is often progressive with time.; As time passes, it becomes difficult to extend or straighten the fingers. In severe cases, straightening them is impossible.","The cause is unknown. You are more likely to develop this condition if you have a family history of it. It does not seem to be caused by occupation or from trauma.; The condition is more common after age 40. Men are affected more often than women. Risk factors are alcohol use, diabetes, and smoking."
001234,Fibrous dysplasia,Inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia; Idiopathic fibrous hyperplasia; McCune-Albright syndrome,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; The bone lesions may stop when the child reaches puberty.; Bone pain; Bone sores (lesions); Hormone (endocrine gland) problems; Fractures or bone deformities; Unusual skin color (pigmentation), which occurs with McCune-Albright syndrome",Fibrous dysplasia usually occurs in childhood. Most people have symptoms by the time they are 30 years old. The disease occurs more often in females.; Fibrous dysplasia is linked to a problem with genes (gene mutation) that control bone-producing cells. The mutation occurs when a baby is developing in the womb. The condition is not passed from parent to child.
001235,Hammer toe,,"The middle joint of the toe is bent. The end part of the toe bends down into a claw-like deformity. At first, you may be able to move and straighten the toe. Over time, you will no longer be able to move the toe. It will be painful.; A corn often forms on the top of the toe. A callus is found on the sole of the foot.; Walking or wearing shoes can be painful.","Hammer toe most often affects the second toe. However, it may also affect the other toes.; The most common cause of hammer toe is wearing short, narrow shoes that are too tight. The toe is forced into a bent position. Muscles and tendons in the toe tighten and become shorter.; Hammer toe is more likely to occur in:; The condition may be present at birth (congenital) or develop over time.; In rare cases, all of the toes are affected. This may be caused by a problem with the nerves or spinal cord.; Women who wear shoes that do not fit well or often wear shoes with high heels; Children who wear shoes they have outgrown"
001236,Illness anxiety disorder,Somatic symptom and related disorders; Hypochondriasis,"People with IAD can't control their fears and worries. They often believe any symptom or sensation is a sign of a serious illness.; They seek out reassurance from family, friends, or health care providers on a regular basis. They feel better for a short time and then begin to worry about the same symptoms or new symptoms.; Symptoms may shift and change, and are often vague. People with IAD often examine their own body.; Some may realize that their fear is unreasonable or unfounded.; IAD is different from somatic symptom disorder. With somatic symptom disorder, the person has physical pain or other symptoms, but the medical cause isn't found.","People with IAD are overly focused on, and always thinking about, their physical health. They have an unrealistic fear of having or developing a serious disease. This disorder occurs equally in men and women.; The way people with IAD think about their physical symptoms can make them more likely to have this condition. As they focus on and worry about physical sensations, a cycle of symptoms and worry begins, which can be hard to stop.; It is important to realize that people with IAD do not purposely create these symptoms. They aren't able to control the symptoms.; People who have a history of physical or sexual abuse are more likely to have IAD. But this doesn't mean that everyone with IAD has a history of abuse."
001237,Ingrown toenail,Onychocryptosis; Unguis incarnates; Surgical nail avulsion; Matrix excision; Ingrown toenail removal,"There may be pain, redness, and swelling around the nail.","An ingrown toenail can result from a number of things. Poorly fitting shoes and toenails that are not properly trimmed are the most common causes. The skin along the edge of a toenail may become red and infected. The great toe is affected most often, but any toenail can become ingrown.; An ingrown toenail may occur when extra pressure is placed on your toe. This pressure is caused by shoes that are too tight or fit poorly. If you walk often or play sports, a shoe that is even a little tight can cause this problem. Deformities of the foot or toes can also place extra pressure on the toe.; Nails that are not trimmed properly can also cause ingrown toenails:; Some people are born with nails that are curved and grow into the skin. Others have toenails that are too large for their toes. Stubbing your toe or other injuries can also lead to an ingrown toenail.; Toenails that are trimmed too short, or if the edges are rounded rather than cut straight across may cause the nail to curl and grow into the skin.; Poor eyesight, inability to reach the toes easily, or having thick nails can make it hard to properly trim nails.; Picking or tearing at the corners of the nails can also cause an ingrown toenail."
001238,Intraductal papilloma,,"Symptoms include:; These findings may be in just one breast or in both breasts.; For the most part, these papillomas do not cause pain.; Breast lump; Nipple discharge, which may be clear or bloodstained",Intraductal papilloma occurs most often in women ages 35 to 55.

This disorder leads to long-term (chronic) and repeated (recurrent) infections. The condition is often discovered very early in childhood. Milder forms may be diagnosed during the teenage years, or even in adulthood.; Risk factors include a family history of recurrent or chronic infections.; About half of CGD cases are passed down through families as a sex-linked recessive trait. This means that boys are more likely to get the disorder than girls. The defective gene is carried on the X chromosome. Boys have 1 X chromosome and 1 Y chromosome. If a boy has an X chromosome with the defective gene, he may inherit this condition. Girls have 2 X chromosomes. If a girl has 1 X chromosome with the defective gene, the other X chromosome may have a working gene to make up for it. A girl must inherit the defective X gene from each parent in order to have the disease."
001240,Kyphosis,Scheuermann disease; Roundback; Hunchback; Postural kyphosis; Neck pain - kyphosis,Pain in the middle or lower back is the most common symptom. Other symptoms may include any of the following:; Round back appearance; Tenderness and stiffness in the spine; Fatigue; Difficulty breathing (in severe cases),"Kyphosis can occur at any age, although it is rare at birth.; A type of kyphosis that occurs in young teens is known as Scheuermann disease. It is caused by the wedging together of several bones of the spine (vertebrae) in a row. The cause of this condition is unknown. Kyphosis can also occur in young teens who have cerebral palsy.; In adults, kyphosis can be caused by:; Other causes of kyphosis include:; Degenerative diseases of the spine (such as arthritis or disk degeneration); Fractures caused by osteoporosis (osteoporotic compression fractures); Injury (trauma); Slipping of one vertebra forward on another (spondylolisthesis); Certain hormone (endocrine) diseases; Connective tissue disorders; Infection (such as tuberculosis); Muscular dystrophy (group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue); Neurofibromatosis (disorder in which nerve tissue tumors form); Paget disease (disorder that involves abnormal bone destruction and regrowth); Polio; Scoliosis (curving of the spine often looks like a C or S when viewed from behind); Spina bifida (birth defect in which the backbone and spinal canal don't close before birth); Tumors"
001241,Scoliosis,Spinal curvature; Infantile scoliosis; Juvenile scoliosis,"Most often, there are no symptoms.; If there are symptoms, they may include:; Backache or low-back pain that goes down the legs; Weakness or tired feeling in the spine after sitting or standing for a long time; Uneven hips or shoulders (one shoulder may be higher than the other); Shoulder pain; Spine curves more to one side; Difficulty with breathing or sitting","Most of the time, the cause of scoliosis is unknown. This is called idiopathic scoliosis. It is the most common type. It is grouped by age.; Scoliosis most often affects girls. Some people are more likely to have curving of the spine. Curving generally gets worse during a growth spurt.; Other types of scoliosis are:; In children age 3 and younger, it is called infantile scoliosis.; In children age 4 through 10, it is called juvenile scoliosis.; In children age 11 through 18, it is called adolescent scoliosis.; Congenital scoliosis: This type of scoliosis is present at birth. It occurs when the baby's ribs or spine bones do not form properly.; Neuromuscular scoliosis: This type is caused by a nervous system problem that affects the muscles. Problems can include cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, and polio."
001242,Tenosynovitis,Inflammation of the tendon sheath,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Fever, swelling, and redness may indicate an infection, especially if a puncture or cut caused these symptoms.; Difficulty moving the joint; Joint swelling in the affected area; Pain and tenderness around the joint; Pain when moving the joint; Redness along the length of the tendon","The synovium is the lining of the protective sheath that covers tendons. Tenosynovitis is inflammation of this sheath. The cause of the inflammation may be unknown, or it may result from:; The wrists, hands, ankles, and feet are commonly affected because the tendons are long across those joints. But, the condition may occur with any tendon sheath.; An infected cut to the hands or wrists that causes infectious tenosynovitis may be an emergency requiring surgery.; Diseases that cause inflammation; Infection; Injury; Overuse; Strain"
001243,Arthritis,Joint inflammation; Joint degeneration,"Arthritis causes joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited movement. Symptoms can include:; Joint pain; Joint swelling; Joint deformity; Reduced ability to move the joint; Redness and warmth of the skin around a joint; Joint stiffness, especially in the morning","Arthritis involves the breakdown of structures of the joint, particularly cartilage. Normal cartilage protects a joint and allows it to move smoothly. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, such as when you walk. Without the normal amount of cartilage, the bones under the cartilage become damaged and rub together. This causes swelling (inflammation), and stiffness.; Other joint structures affected by arthritis include:; Joint inflammation and damage may result from:; In most cases, the joint inflammation goes away after the cause goes away or is treated. Sometimes, it does not. When this happens, you have long-term (chronic) arthritis.; Arthritis may occur in people of any age and sex. Osteoarthritis, which is due to non-inflammatory processes and increases with age, is the most common type.; Other, more common types of inflammatory arthritis include:; The synovium; The bone next to the joint; Ligaments and tendons; Sacs that may be fluid-filled next to bone, ligaments and tendons (bursae); An autoimmune disease (the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue); Broken bone; General ""wear and tear"" on joints; Infection, most often by bacteria or viruses; Crystals such as uric acid or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate; Ankylosing spondylitis; Crystal arthritis, gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease; Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (in children); Bacterial infections; Psoriatic arthritis; Reactive arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis (in adults); Scleroderma; Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)"
001244,Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS),CFS; Fatigue - chronic; Immune dysfunction syndrome; Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME); Myalgic encephalopathy chronic fatigue syndrome (ME-CFS); Systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID),"There are three main, or ""core,"" symptoms in people with ME/CFS:; People with ME/CFS have persistent and profound fatigue and are unable to do activities they were able to do before the illness. This extreme fatigue is:; ME/CFS symptoms can become worse after physical or mental activity. This is called post-exertional malaise (PEM), also known as a crash, relapse, or collapse.; Sleep issues may include problems falling or staying asleep. A full-night's rest does not relieve fatigue and other symptoms.; People with ME/CFS also often experience at least one of the two following symptoms:; Other common symptoms include:; Profound fatigue; Worsening symptoms after physical or mental activity; Sleep problems; New; Lasts at least 6 months; Not due to unusual or intense activity; Not relieved by sleep or bed rest; Severe enough to keep you from participating in certain activities; For example, you may experience a crash after shopping at the grocery store and need to take a nap before driving home. Or you may need someone to come pick you up.; There is no way to predict what will cause a crash or know how long it will take to recover. It can take days, weeks, or longer to recover.; Forgetfulness, concentration problems, problems following details (also called ""brain fog""); Worsening symptoms when standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. You may feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint when standing or sitting up. You also may have vision changes or see spots.; Joint pain without swelling or redness, muscle aches, muscle weakness all over, or headaches that differ from those you have had in the past; Sore throat, sore lymph nodes in the neck or under the arms, chills and night sweats; Digestive problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome; Allergies; Sensitivity to noise, food, odors, or chemicals","The exact cause of ME/CFS is unknown. It may have more than one cause. For example, two or more possible causes may work together to trigger the illness.; Researchers are looking into these possible causes:; Genetics or environmental factors may also play a role in the development of ME/CFS:; Infection -- About 1 out of 10 people who develop certain infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus and Q fever, go on to develop ME/CFS. Other infections have also been studied, but not one cause has been found.; Immune system changes -- ME/CFS may be triggered by changes in the way a person's immune system responds to stress or illness.; Mental or physical stress -- Many people with ME/CFS have been under serious mental or physical stress before becoming ill.; Energy production -- The way that cells within the body get energy is different in people with ME/CFS than in people without the condition. It's unclear how this is linked to developing the illness.; Long COVID or Post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC) -- Some people who have been infected with the COVID-19 virus continue to have symptoms weeks or months later. This is called long COVID. Because symptoms such as extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, and sleep problems are similar to ME/CFS, researchers are looking into a possible connection between the two conditions.; Anyone can get ME/CFS.; While most common in people between 40 and 60 years old, the illness affects children, adolescents, and adults of all ages.; Among adults, women are affected more often than men.; White people are diagnosed more than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, particularly among minorities."
001245,Myositis,Inflammatory myopathies,,
001246,Mucopolysaccharidoses,MPS; Lysosomal storage disease - mucopolysaccharidosis,,
001247,Achondrogenesis,,"Symptoms may include:; Very short trunk, arms, legs, and neck; Head appears large in relation to the trunk; Small lower jaw; Narrow chest","Achondrogenesis is inherited, which means it is passed down through families.; Some types are known to be recessive, meaning both parents carry the defective gene but are not affected by this condition. The chance for a subsequent child to be affected is 25%."
001248,Acrodysostosis,Arkless-Graham; Acrodysplasia; Maroteaux-Malamut,"Symptoms of this disorder include:; Frequent middle ear infections; Growth problems, short arms and legs; Hearing problems; Intellectual disability; The body doesn't respond to certain hormones, even though hormone levels are normal; Distinct facial features","Most people with acrodysostosis have no family history of the disease. However, sometimes the condition is passed down from parent to child. Parents with the condition have a 1 in 2 chance of passing the disorder to their children.; There is a slightly greater risk with fathers who are older."
001249,Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome,"Rubinstein syndrome, RTS","Symptoms include:; Other signs and symptoms may include:; Broadening of the thumbs and big toes; Constipation; Excess hair on body (hirsutism); Heart defects, possibly requiring surgery; Intellectual disability; Seizures; Short stature that is noticeable after birth; Slow development of cognitive skills; Slow development of motor skills accompanied by low muscle tone; Absent or extra kidney, and other problems with kidney or bladder; An underdeveloped bone in the midface; Unsteady or stiff walking gait; Downward-slanted eyes; Low-set ears or malformed ears; Drooping eyelid (ptosis); Cataracts; Coloboma (a defect in the iris of the eye); Microcephaly (excessively small head); Narrow, small, or recessed mouth with crowded teeth; Prominent or ""beaked"" nose; Thick and arched eyebrows with long eyelashes; Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism), or other testicular problems","RTS is a rare condition. Variations in the genes CREBBP or EP300 are seen in some people with this condition.; Some people are missing the gene entirely. This is more typical in people with more severe problems.; Most cases are sporadic (not passed down through families). They are likely due to a new genetic variant that occurs either in the sperm or egg cells, or at the time of conception."
001250,Takayasu arteritis,"Pulseless disease, Large-vessel vasculitis",Symptoms may include:; There may also be signs of inflammation (pericarditis or pleuritis).; Arm weakness or pain with use; Chest pain; Dizziness; Fatigue; Fever; Lightheadedness; Muscle or joint pain; Skin rash; Night sweats; Vision changes; Weight loss; Decreased radial pulses (at the wrist); Difference in blood pressure between the two arms; High blood pressure (hypertension),"The cause of Takayasu arteritis is not known. The disease occurs mainly in children and women between the ages of 20 to 40. It is more common in people of East Asian, Indian or Mexican descent. However, it is now being seen more often in other parts of the world. Several genes that increase the chance of having this problem were recently found.; Takayasu arteritis appears to be an autoimmune condition. This means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in the blood vessel wall. The condition may also involve other organ systems.; This condition has many features that are similar to giant cell arteritis or temporal arteritis in older people."
001251,Necrotizing granuloma,Granuloma,,
001252,Osteitis fibrosa,Osteitis fibrosa cystica; Hyperparathyroidism - osteitis fibrosa; Brown tumor of bone,"Osteitis fibrosa may cause bone pain or tenderness. There may be fractures (breaks) in the arms, legs, or spine, or other bone problems.; Hyperparathyroidism itself may cause any of the following:; Nausea; Constipation; Fatigue; Frequent urination; Weakness","The parathyroid glands are 4 tiny glands in the neck. These glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and is important for healthy bones.; Too much parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism) can lead to increased bone breakdown, which can cause bones to become weaker and more fragile. Many people with hyperparathyroidism eventually develop osteoporosis. Not all bones respond to PTH in the same way. Some develop abnormal areas where the bone is very soft and has almost no calcium in it. This is osteitis fibrosa.; In rare cases, parathyroid cancer causes osteitis fibrosa.; Osteitis fibrosa is now very rare in people who have hyperparathyroidism and good access to medical care. It is more common in people who develop hyperparathyroidism at a young age, or have untreated hyperparathyroidism for a long time."
001253,Perichondritis,,"A painful, swollen, red ear is the most common symptom. At first, the infection will look like a skin infection, but it quickly worsens and involves the perichondrium.; The redness usually surrounds an area of injury, such as a cut or scrape. There may also be fever. In more severe cases, fluid will drain from the wound.","Cartilage is the thick tissue that creates the shape of the nose and the outer ear. All cartilage has a thin layer of tissue around it called the perichondrium. This covering helps provide nutrients to the cartilage.; The most common type of bacteria that causes perichondritis infection is Pseudomonas aeruginosa.; Perichondritis is usually caused by an injury to the ear due to:; Ear piercing through the cartilage is probably the major risk factor today. Surgery, burns, and acupuncture also increase the risk for infection.; Perichondritis can lead to chondritis, which is an infection of the cartilage itself.Â This can cause severe damage to the ear structure.; Ear surgery; Ear piercing (especially piercing of the cartilage); Contact sports; Trauma to the side of the head"
001254,Petrositis,,,
001255,Retroperitoneal inflammation,Retroperitonitis,Symptoms include:; Abdominal pain; Anorexia; Flank pain; Low back pain; Malaise,"Retroperitoneal inflammation and fibrosis is a rare condition. There is no clear cause in about 70% of cases. It most likely develops due to inflammation of the abdominal aortic artery.; Conditions that can rarely lead to this include:; Abdominal radiation therapy for cancer; Cancer -- bladder, breast, colon, lymphoma, prostate, sarcoma; Carcinoid tumor; Crohn disease; Infections -- tuberculosis, histoplasmosis; Certain medicines,Â such as methysergide, ergotamine, pergolide, methyldopa, etanercept and infliximab; Surgery of structures in the retroperitoneum"
001256,Scleroma,Induration; Rhinoscleroma,,
001257,Uvulitis,Swollen uvula,Symptoms may include any of the following:; Fever; Feeling like something is in your throat; Choking or gagging; Coughing; Pain while swallowing; Excessive saliva; Decreased or no appetite,"Uvulitis is mainly caused by an infection with streptococcus bacteria. Other causes are:; Injury can occur due to:; An injury to the back of the throat; An allergic reaction from pollen, dust, pet dander, or foods such as peanuts or eggs; Inhaling or swallowing certain chemicals; Reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus; Smoking; Endoscopy - test that involves inserting a tube through the mouth into the esophagus to view the lining of the esophagus and stomach; Surgery such as tonsil removal; Damage due to acid reflux"
001258,Osgood-Schlatter disease,Osteochondrosis; Knee pain - Osgood-Schlatter,"The main symptom is painful swelling over a bump on the lower leg bone (shinbone). Symptoms occur on one or both legs.; You may have leg pain or knee pain, which gets worse with running, jumping, and climbing stairs.; The area is tender to pressure, and swelling ranges from mild to severe.","Osgood-Schlatter disease is thought to be caused by small injuries to the knee area from overuse before the knee is finished growing.; The quadriceps muscle is a large, strong muscle on the front part of the upper leg. When this muscle squeezes (contracts), it straightens the knee. The quadriceps muscle is an important muscle for running, jumping, and climbing.; When the quadriceps muscle is used a lot in sports activities during a child's growth spurt, this area becomes irritated or swollen and causes pain.; It is common in adolescents who play soccer, basketball, and volleyball, and who participate in gymnastics. Osgood-Schlatter disease affects more boys than girls."
001260,Spondylolisthesis,Low back pain - spondylolisthesis; LBP - spondylolisthesis; Lumbar pain - spondylolisthesis; Degenerative spine - spondylolisthesis,"Symptoms of spondylolisthesis may vary from mild to severe. A person with spondylolisthesis may have no symptoms. Children may not show symptoms until they're 18 years old.; The condition can lead to increased and abnormal lordosis (also called swayback). In later stages, it may result in kyphosis (roundback) as the upper spine falls off the lower spine.; Symptoms may include any of the following:; Lower back pain; Muscle tightness (tight hamstring muscle); Pain, numbness, or tinglingÂ in the thighs and buttocks; Stiffness; Tenderness in the area of the vertebra that is out of place; Weakness in the legs","In children, spondylolisthesis usually occurs between the fifth bone in the lower back (lumbar vertebra) and the first bone in the sacrum (pelvis) area. It is often due to a birth defect in that area of the spine or sudden injury (acute trauma).; In adults, the most common cause is abnormal wear on the cartilage and bones, such as arthritis. The condition mostly affects people over 50 years old. It is more common in women than in men.; Bone disease and fractures can also cause spondylolisthesis. Certain sports activities, such as gymnastics, weightlifting, and football, greatly stress the bones in the lower back. They also require that the athlete constantly overstretch (hyperextend) the spine. This can lead to a stress fracture on one or both sides of the vertebra. A stress fracture can cause a spinal bone to become weak and shift out of place."
001261,High arch,Pes cavus; High foot arch,"Symptoms include:; Shortened foot length; Difficulty fitting shoes; Foot pain with walking, standing, and running (not everyone has this symptom)","High foot arches are much less common than flat feet. They can be caused by a bone (orthopedic) or nerve (neurological) condition.; Unlike flat feet, highly arched feet tend to be painful. This is so because more stress is placed on the section of the foot between the ankle and toes (metatarsals). This condition can make it difficult to fit into shoes. People who have high arches most often need foot support. A high arch may cause disability."
001262,Flat feet,Pes planovalgus; Fallen arches; Pronation of feet; Pes planus,"Most flat feet do not cause pain or other problems.; Children don't often have foot pain, ankle pain, or lower leg pain. They should be evaluated by a health care provider if this occurs.; Symptoms in adults may include tired or achy feet after long periods of standing or playing sports. You also may have pain on the outside of the ankle.; For patients that have had flat foot for a long time, you may develop changes in the appearance and flexibility of your toes also. You can have pain in the deformed toes.","Flat feet are a common condition. The condition is normal in infants and toddlers.; Flat feet occur because the tissues holding the joints in the foot together (called tendons) are loose.; The tissues tighten and form an arch as children grow older. This will take place by the time the child is 2 or 3 years old. Most people have normal arches by the time they are adults. However, the arch may never form in some people.; Some hereditary conditions cause loose tendons and ligaments.; People born with these conditions may have flat feet.; Aging, injuries, or illness may harm the tendons and cause flat feet to develop in a person who has already formed arches. This type of flat foot may occur only on one side.; Rarely, painful flat feet in children may be caused by a condition in which two or more of the bones in the foot grow or fuse together. This condition is called tarsal coalition.; Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome; Marfan Syndrome"
001263,Knock knees,Genu valgum,,"Infants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother's womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart.; By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position).; Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as:; Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed); Osteomyelitis (bone infection); Overweight or obesity; Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D)"
001264,Legg-Calve-Perthes disease,Coxa plana; Perthes disease,"The first symptom is often limping, which is usually painless. Sometimes there may be mild pain that comes and goes.; Other symptoms may include:; Hip stiffness that limits hip movement; Knee pain; Limited range of motion; Thigh or groin pain that does not go away; Shortening of the leg, or legs of unequal length; Muscle loss in the upper thigh","Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs in boys 4 through 11 years old. There are many theories about the cause of this disease, but little is actually known.; Without enough blood to the area, the bone dies. The ball of the hip collapses and becomes flat. Most often, only one hip is affected, although it can occur on both sides.; The blood supply returns over several months, bringing in new bone cells. The new cells gradually replace the dead bone over 2 to 3 years."
001265,Renal and urological disorders,Urological disorders,,
001266,Osmotic diuresis,,,"Osmotic diuresis can be caused by:; High blood sugar (glucose); Use of certain medicines, such as Mannitol"
001267,Ureteropelvic junction obstruction,Ureteropelvic junction obstruction; UP junction obstruction; Obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction,"There may not be any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include:; Back or flank pain especially when consuming diuretics such as alcohol or caffeine; Bloody urine (hematuria); Lump in the abdomen (abdominal mass); Kidney infection; Poor growth in infants (failure to thrive); Urinary tract infection, usually with fever; Vomiting","UPJ obstruction mostly occurs in children. It often happens when a baby is still growing in the womb. This is called a congenital condition (present from birth).; The blockage is caused when there is:; As a result, urine builds up and damages the kidney.; In older children and adults, the problem may be due to scar tissue, infection, earlier treatments for a blockage, or kidney stones.; UPJ obstruction is the most common cause of urinary blockages in children. It is now commonly found before birth with ultrasound tests. In some cases, the condition may not show up until after birth. Surgery may be needed early in life if the problem is severe. Most of the time, surgery is not needed until later. Some cases do not require surgery at all.; A narrowing of area between the ureter and the part of the kidney called the renal pelvis; An abnormal blood vessel crossing over the ureter"
001268,Potter syndrome,Potter phenotype; Potter's syndrome,"Symptoms include:; Widely separated eyes with epicanthal folds, broad nasal bridge, low set ears, and receding chin; Absence of urine output; Difficulty breathing","In Potter syndrome, the primary problem is kidney failure. The kidneys fail to develop properly as the baby is growing in the womb. The kidneys normally produce the amniotic fluid (as urine) that surrounds the unborn baby.; Potter phenotype refers to a typical facial appearance that occurs in a newborn when there is no amniotic fluid. The lack of amniotic fluid is called oligohydramnios. Without amniotic fluid, the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus. The pressure of the uterine wall leads to an unusual facial appearance, including widely separated eyes.; Potter phenotype may also lead to abnormal limbs, or limbs that are held in abnormal positions or contractures.; Oligohydramnios also stops development of the lungs, so the lungs do not work properly at birth."
001269,Prune belly syndrome,Eagle-Barrett syndrome; Triad syndrome,Weak abdominal muscles can cause:; Urinary tract problems can cause difficulty urinating.; Constipation; Delay in sitting and walking; Difficulties coughing,"The exact causes of prune belly syndrome are unknown. The condition affects mostly boys.; While in the womb (uterus), the developing baby's abdomen swells with fluid. Often, the cause is a problem in the urinary tract. The fluid disappears after birth, leading to a wrinkled abdomen that looks like a prune. This appearance is more noticeable due to the lack of abdominal muscles."
001270,Urge incontinence,Overactive bladder; Detrusor instability; Detrusor hyperreflexia; Irritable bladder; Spasmodic bladder; Unstable bladder; Incontinence - urge; Bladder spasms; Urinary incontinence - urge,Symptoms include:; Not being able to control when you pass urine; Having to urinate often during the day and night; Needing to urinate suddenly and urgently,"As your bladder fills with urine from the kidneys, it stretches to make room for the urine. You should feel the first urge to urinate when there is a bit less than 1 cup (240 milliliters) of urine in your bladder. Most people can hold more than 2 cups (480 milliliters) of urine in the bladder.; Two muscles help prevent the flow of urine:; When you urinate, the bladder wall muscle squeezes to force urine out of the bladder. As this happens, the sphincter muscle relaxes to allow the urine to pass through.; All of these systems must work together to control urination:; The bladder may contract too often due to nervous system problems or bladder irritation.; URGE INCONTINENCE; With urge incontinence, you leak urine because the bladder muscles squeeze, or contract, at the wrong times. These contractions often occur no matter how much urine is in the bladder.; Urge incontinence may result from:; In men, urge incontinence also may be due to:; In most cases of urge incontinence, no cause can be found.; Although urge incontinence may occur in anyone at any age, it is more common in women and older adults.; The sphincter is a muscle around the opening of the bladder. It squeezes to prevent urine from leaking into the urethra. This is the tube that urine passes through from your bladder to the outside.; The bladder wall muscle relaxes so the bladder can expand and hold urine.; Your bladder muscles and other parts of your urinary tract; The nerves controlling your urinary system; Your ability to feel and respond to the urge to urinate; Bladder cancer; Bladder inflammation; Something blocking urine from leaving the bladder; Bladder stones; Infection; Brain or nerve problems, such as multiple sclerosis or stroke,Â that affects the bladder muscles; Nerve injury, such as from a spinal cord injury; Bladder changes caused by an enlarged prostate, called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); An enlarged prostate blocking urine from flowing from the bladder"
001271,Urethral stricture,,Symptoms include:; Blood in the semen; Discharge from the urethra; Bloody or dark urine; Strong urge to urinate and frequent urination; Inability to empty bladder (urinary retention); Painful urination or difficulty urinating; Loss of bladder control; Increased frequency or urgency to urinate; Pain in the lower abdomen and pelvic area; Slow urine stream (may develop suddenly or gradually) or spraying of urine; Swelling of the penis,"A urethral stricture may be caused by swelling or scar tissue from surgery. It can also occur after an infection or injury. Rarely, it may be caused by pressure from a growing tumor near the urethra.; Other factors that increase the risk for this condition include:; Strictures that are present at birth (congenital) are rare. The condition is also rare in women.; Sexually transmitted infection (STI); Procedures that place a tube into the urethra (such as a catheter or cystoscope); Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); Injury to the pelvic area; Repeated urethritis"
001272,Acute arterial occlusion - kidney,Acute renal arterial thrombosis; Renal artery embolism; Acute renal artery occlusion; Embolism - renal artery,"You may not have symptoms when one kidney does not function because the second kidney can filter the blood. However, high blood pressure (hypertension) may come on suddenly and be difficult to control.; If your other kidney is not working fully, blockage of the renal artery may cause symptoms of acute kidney failure. Other symptoms of acute arterial occlusion of the renal artery include:; Note: There may be no pain. Pain, if it is present, most often develops suddenly.; Abdominal pain; Abrupt decrease in urine output; Back pain; Blood in the urine; Flank pain or pain in the side; Symptoms of high blood pressure such as headache, change in vision, and swelling","The kidneys need a good blood supply. The main artery to the kidney is called the renal artery. Reduced blood flow through the renal artery can hurt kidney function. A complete blockage of blood flow to the kidney can often result in permanent kidney failure.; Acute arterial occlusion of the renal artery can occur after injury or trauma to the abdomen, side, or back. Blood clots that travel through the bloodstream (emboli) can lodge in the renal artery. Pieces of plaque from the walls of the arteries can come loose (on their own or during a medical procedure that affects an artery). This debris can block the main kidney artery or one of the smaller vessels.; The risk of renal artery blockages increases in people who have certain heart disorders, which make them likely to form blood clots. These include mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation.; A narrowing of the renal artery is called renal artery stenosis. This condition increases the risk of a sudden blockage."
001274,Perirenal abscess,Perinephric abscess,"Symptoms of perirenal abscess include:; Chills; Fever; Pain in the flank (side of the abdomen) or abdomen, which may extend to the groin or down the leg; Sweating","Most perirenal abscesses are caused by a urinary tract infection that starts in the bladder. It then spreads to the kidney, and to the area around the kidney. Surgery in the urinary tract or reproductive system or a bloodstream infection can also lead to a perirenal abscess.; The biggest risk factor for perirenal abscess is kidney stones, by blockage of urine flow. This provides a place for an infection to grow. Bacteria tend to stick to the stones and antibiotics cannot kill the bacteria there.; Stones are found in 20% to 60% of people with perirenal abscess. Other risk factors for perirenal abscess include:; Diabetes; Having an abnormal urinary tract; Trauma to the kidney; IV (intravenous) drug use"
001275,Bladder stones,Stones - bladder; Urinary tract stones; Bladder calculi,"Symptoms occur when the stone irritates the lining of the bladder. The stones may also block the flow of urine from the bladder.; Symptoms can include:; Loss of urine control may also occur with bladder stones.; Abdominal pain, pressure; Abnormally colored or dark-colored urine; Blood in the urine; Difficulty urinating; Frequent urge to urinate; Inability to urinate except in certain positions; Interruption of the urine stream; Pain, discomfort in the penis; Signs of UTI (such as fever, pain when urinating, and need to urinate often)","Bladder stones are most often caused by another urinary system problem, such as:; Almost all bladder stones occur in men. Bladder stones are much less common than kidney stones.; Bladder stones may occur when urine in the bladder is concentrated. Materials in the urine form crystals. These may also result from foreign objects in the bladder.; Bladder diverticulum; Blockage at the base of the bladder; Enlarged prostate (BPH); Neurogenic bladder; Urinary tract infectionÂ (UTI); Incomplete emptying of the bladder; Foreign objects in the bladder"
001276,Penile cancer,Cancer - penis; Squamous cell cancer - penis; Glansectomy; Partial penectomy,"Early symptoms may include:; As the cancer advances, symptoms may include:; Sore, bump, rash, or swelling at the tip or on the shaft of the penis; Foul-smelling discharge beneath the foreskin; Pain and bleeding from the penis (may occur with advanced disease); Lumps in the groin area from spread of the cancer to the groin lymph nodes; Weight loss; Difficulty in passing urine","Cancer of the penis is rare. Its exact cause is unknown. However, certain risk factors include:; The cancer usually affects middle age and older men.; Uncircumcised men who don't keep the area under the foreskin clean. This leads to buildup of smegma, a cheese-like, foul-smelling substance under the foreskin.; History of genital warts, or human papillomavirus (HPV).; Smoking.; Injury to the penis."
001278,Curvature of the penis,Peyronie disease,"You or your health care provider may notice an abnormal hardening of the tissue below the skin, in one area along the shaft of the penis. It may also feel like a hard lump or bump.; During erection, there may be:; A bend in the penis, which most often begins at the area where you feel the scar tissue or hardening; Softening of the portion of the penis beyond the area of scar tissue; Narrowing of the penis; Pain; Problems with penetration or pain during intercourse; Shortening of the penis","In Peyronie disease, fibrous scar tissue develops in the deep tissues of the penis. The cause of this fibrous tissue is often not known. It can occur spontaneously. It can also be due to a previous injury to the penis, even one that occurred many years ago.; Fracture of the penis (injury during intercourse) can lead to this condition. Men are at higher risk for developing curvature of the penis after surgery or radiation treatment for prostate cancer.; Peyronie disease is uncommon. It affects men ages 40 and older.; Curvature of the penis can occur along with Dupuytren contracture. This is a cord-like thickening across the palm of one or both hands. It is a fairly common disorder in white men over age 50. However, only a very small number of people with Dupuytren contracture develop curvature of the penis.; Other risk factors have not been found. However, people with this condition have a certain type of immune cell marker, which indicates that it may be inherited.; Newborns may have a curvature of the penis. This may be part of an abnormality called chordee, which is different from Peyronie disease."
001279,Epididymitis,,"Epididymitis may begin with:; The testicle area will get more sensitive to pressure. It will become painful as the condition progresses.

It is most often caused by a bacterial infection. Infection often begins in the urethra, the prostate, or the bladder. Gonorrhea and chlamydia infections are most often the cause of the problem in young heterosexual men. In children and older men, it is more commonly caused by E coli and similar bacteria. This is also true in men who have sex with men.; Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) can cause epididymitis. Other bacteria (such as Ureaplasma) may also cause the condition.; Amiodarone is a medicine which prevents abnormal heart rhythms. This medicine can also cause epididymitis.; The following increase the risk for epididymitis:; Recent surgery; Past structural problems in the urinary tract; Regular use of a urethral catheter; Sexual intercourse with more than one partner and not using condoms; Enlarged prostate"

Many types of bacteria and viruses can cause this condition.; The most common virus that causes orchitis is mumps. It most often occurs in boys after puberty. Orchitis most often develops 4 to 6 days after the mumps begins.; Orchitis may also occur along with infections of the prostate or epididymis.; Orchitis may be caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. The rate of sexually transmitted orchitis or epididymitis is higher in men ages 19 to 35.; Risk factors for sexually transmitted orchitis include:; Risk factors for orchitis not due to an STI include:; High-risk sexual behaviors; Multiple sexual partners; Personal history of gonorrhea or another STI; Sexual partner with a diagnosed STI; Being older than age 45; Long-term use of a Foley catheter; Not being vaccinated against the mumps virus; Problems of the urinary tract that were present at birth (congenital); Repeated urinary tract infections; Surgery of the urinary tract (genitourinary surgery); BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) - enlarged prostate; Urethral stricture (scarring inside urinary tract that causes narrowing of the passageway)"
001281,Paraphimosis,,The foreskin is pulled back (retracted) behind the rounded tip of the penis (glans) and stays there. The retracted foreskin and glans become swollen. This makes it difficult to return the foreskin to its extended position.; Symptoms include:; Inability to pull the retracted foreskin forward over the head of the penis; Painful swelling at the end of the penis; Pain in the penis,"Causes of paraphimosis include:; Men who have not been circumcised and those who may not have been correctly circumcised are at risk.; Paraphimosis occurs most often inÂ boys and older men.; Injury to the penis.; Failure to return the foreskin to its normal location after urination or washing. This is more common in hospitals and nursing homes.; Infection, which may be due to not washing the area well."
001282,Retrograde ejaculation,Ejaculation retrograde; Dry climax,Symptoms include:; Cloudy urine after orgasm; Little or no semen is released during ejaculation,"Retrograde ejaculation is uncommon. It most often occurs when the opening of the bladder (bladder neck) does not close. This causes semen to go backward into the bladder rather than forward out of the penis.; Retrograde ejaculation may be caused by:; Diabetes; Some medicines, including drugs used to treat high blood pressure and some mood-altering drugs; Medicines or surgery to treat prostate or urethra problems"
001283,Scrotal masses,Testicular mass; Scrotal growth,Symptoms include:; Enlarged scrotum; Painless or painful testicle lump,A scrotal mass can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).; Benign scrotal masses include:; Scrotal masses can be caused by:; Hematocele -- blood collection in the scrotum; Hydrocele -- fluid collection in the scrotum; Spermatocele -- a cyst-like growth in the scrotum that contains fluid and sperm cells; Varicocele -- a varicose vein along the spermatic cord; Epididymal cyst -- a swelling in the duct behind the testes that transports sperm; Scrotal abscess -- a collection of pus within the wall of the scrotum; Abnormal bulge in the groin (inguinal hernia); Diseases such as epididymitis or orchitis; Injury to the scrotum; Testicular torsion; Testicular cancer; Infections

Blood backs up, leading to swelling and widening of the veins. (This is similar to varicose veins in the legs.); Most of the time, varicoceles develop slowly. They are more common in men ages 15 to 25 and are most often seen on the left side of the scrotum.; A varicocele in an older man that appears suddenly may be caused by a kidney tumor, which can block blood flow to a vein."
001285,Epispadias,Congenital defect - epispadias,"Males will have a short, wide penis with an abnormal curve. The urethra most often opens on the top or side of the penis instead of the tip. However, the urethra may be open along the whole length of the penis.; Females have an abnormal clitoris and labia. The urethral opening is often between the clitoris and the labia, but it may be in the belly area. They may have trouble controlling urination (urinary incontinence).","The causes of epispadias are not known. It may occur because the pubic bone does not develop properly.; Epispadias can occur with a rare birth defect called bladder exstrophy. In this birth defect, the bladder is open through the wall of the abdomen. Epispadias can also occur with other birth defects.; The condition occurs more often in boys than girls. It is most often diagnosed at birth or soon afterward."
001286,Hypospadias,,"Symptoms depend on how severe the problem is.; Most often, boys with this condition have the opening of the urethra near the tip of the penis on the underside.; More severe forms of hypospadias occur when the opening is in the middle or base of the penis. Rarely, the opening is located in or behind the scrotum.; This condition may cause the penis to curve down during an erection. Erections are common in infant boys.; Other symptoms include:; Some boys with hypospadias have one or both testicles that have not moved down into the scrotum (undescended testicle).; Problems peeing without it spraying to the side or down (this can make it difficult to urinate while standing); Foreskin that makes the penis looks like it has a ""hood""","Hypospadias occurs in about 1 in 200 newborn boys in the United States.

Factors that may increase a man's risk of developing testicular cancer are:; Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young and middle-aged men. It can also occur in older men, and in rare cases, in younger boys.; White men are more likely than African American and Asian American men to develop this type of cancer.; There is no link between vasectomy and testicular cancer.; There are two main types of testicular cancer:; These cancers grow from germ cells, the cells that make sperm.; Seminoma: This is a slow-growing form of testicular cancer found in men in their 40s and 50s. The cancer is in the testes, but it can spread to the lymph nodes. Lymph node involvement is either treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Seminomas are very sensitive to radiation therapy.; Nonseminoma: This more common type of testicular cancer tends to grow more quickly than seminomas.; Nonseminoma tumors are often made up of more than one type of cell, and are identified according to these different cell types:; A stromal tumor is a rare type of testicular tumor. They are usually not cancerous. The two main types of stromal tumors are Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli cell tumors. Stromal tumors usually occur during childhood.; Abnormal testicle development; Exposure to certain chemicals; Family history of testicular cancer; HIV infection; History of testicular cancer; History of an undescended testicle

001289,Cancer,Carcinoma; Malignant tumor,"Symptoms of cancer depend on the type and location of the cancer. For example, lung cancer can cause coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Colon cancer may cause diarrhea, constipation, or blood in the stool.; Some cancers may not have any symptoms. In certain cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, symptoms often do not start until the disease has reached an advanced stage.; The following symptoms may occur with cancer:; Chills; Fatigue; Fever; Loss of appetite; Malaise; Night sweats; Pain; Weight loss","Cancer grows out of cells in the body. Normal cells multiply when the body needs them, and die when they are damaged or the body doesn't need them.; Cancer occurs when the genetic material of a cell becomes changed. This results in cells growing out of control. Cells divide too quickly and do not die in a normal way.; There are many kinds of cancer. Cancer can develop in almost any organ or tissue, such as the lung, colon, breast, skin, bones, or nerve tissue.; There are many risk factors for cancer, including:; The cause of many cancers remains unknown.; The most common cause of cancer-related death is lung cancer.; In the United States, skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer.; In US men, other than skin cancer, the three most common cancers are:; In US women, other than skin cancer, the three most common cancers are:; Some cancers are more common in certain parts of the world.

HDN occurs when the immune system of the mother sees a baby's RBCs as foreign. Antibodies then develop against the baby's RBCs. These antibodies attack the RBCs in the baby's blood and cause them to break down too early.; HDN may develop when a mother and her unborn baby have different blood types. The types are based on small substances (antigens) on the surface of the blood cells.; There is more than one way in which the unborn baby's blood type may not match the mother's.; A, B, AB, and O are the 4 major blood group antigens or types. This is the most common form of a mismatch. In most cases, this is not very severe.; Rh is short for the ""rhesus"" antigen or blood type. People are either positive or negative for this antigen. If the mother is Rh-negative and the baby in the womb has Rh-positive cells, her antibodies to the Rh antigen can cross the placenta and cause very severe anemia in the baby. It can be prevented in most cases.; There are other, much less common, types of mismatch between minor blood group antigens. Some of these can also cause severe problems."
001299,Leukemia,,,
001300,Erythroplasia of Queyrat,,The main symptoms are a rash and irritation on the tip or shaft of the penis that persists. The area is most often red and does not respond to topical creams.,The condition is most often seen in men who have not been circumcised. It is linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV).
001301,Lymphadenitis,Lymph node infection; Lymph gland infection; Localized lymphadenopathy,"Symptoms may include:; Lymph nodes may feel rubbery if an abscess (pocket of pus) has formed or they have become inflamed.; Red, tender skin over lymph node; Swollen, tender, or hard lymph nodes; Fever","The lymph system (lymphatics) is a network of lymph nodes, lymph ducts, lymph vessels, and organs that produce and move a fluid called lymph from tissues to the bloodstream.; The lymph glands, or lymph nodes, are small structures that filter the lymph fluid. There are many white blood cells in the lymph nodes to help fight infection.; Lymphadenitis occurs when the glands become enlarged by swelling (inflammation), often in response to bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The swollen glands are usually found near the site of an infection, tumor, or inflammation.; Lymphadenitis may occur after skin infections or other infections caused by bacteria such as streptococcus or staphylococcus. Sometimes, it is caused by rare infections such as tuberculosis or cat scratch disease (bartonella)."
001302,Ewing sarcoma,Bone cancer - Ewing sarcoma; Ewing family of tumors; Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET); Bone neoplasm - Ewing sarcoma; Ewing's sarcoma,"There are few symptoms. The most common is pain and sometimes swelling at the site of the tumor.; Because the tumor weakens the bone, children may also break a bone at the site of the tumor after a minor injury.; Fever may also be present.","Ewing sarcoma can occur anytime during childhood and young adulthood. But it usually develops during puberty, when bones are growing rapidly. It is more common in White children than in Black or Asian children.; The tumor may start anywhere in the body. Most often, it starts in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, or the chest. It can also develop in the skull or the flat bones of the trunk.; The tumor often spreads (metastasizes) to the lungs and other bones. At the time of diagnosis, spread is seen in about one third of children with Ewing sarcoma.; In rare cases, Ewing sarcoma occurs in adults."
001303,Hemolytic transfusion reaction,Blood transfusion reaction; Transfusion reaction,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Symptoms of a hemolytic transfusion reaction most often appear during or right after the transfusion. Sometimes, they may develop after several days (delayed transfusion reaction).; Back pain; Bloody urine; Chills; Fainting or dizziness; Fever; Flank pain; Flushing of the skin","Blood is classified into four different types: A, B, AB, and O.; Another way blood cells may be classified is by Rh factors. People who have Rh factors in their blood are called ""Rh positive."" People without these factors are called ""Rh negative."" Rh negative people form antibodies against Rh factor if they receive Rh positive blood.; There are also many other blood-related factors that differ among people, in addition to ABO and Rh.; Your immune system can usually tell its own blood cells from those of another person. If you receive blood that is even partially not compatible with your blood, your body produces antibodies to destroy the donor's blood cells. This process causes the transfusion reaction. Blood that you receive in a transfusion must be compatible with your own blood. This means that your body does not have antibodies against the blood you receive.; Most of the time, a blood transfusion between compatible groups (such as O+ to O+) does not cause a problem. However, minor mismatches in blood factors can cause a reaction. It is usually mild. Blood transfusions between incompatible groups (such as A+ to O-) cause an immune response. This can lead to a serious transfusion reaction. The immune system attacks the donated blood cells, destroying them.; Today, all blood is carefully screened. Transfusion reactions are rare."
001304,Bleeding disorders,Coagulopathy,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; The problems that occur depend on the specific bleeding disorder, and how severe it is.; Bleeding into joints or muscles; Bruising easily; Heavy bleeding; Heavy menstrual bleeding; Nosebleeds that do not stop easily; Excessive bleeding with surgical procedures; Umbilical cord bleeding after birth","Normal blood clotting involves blood particles, called platelets, and as many as 20 different plasma proteins that layer over the platelets. These proteins are known as blood clotting or coagulation factors. These factors interact with other chemicals to form a substance called fibrin that stops bleeding.; Problems can occur when platelets are low in number or do not work properly or when certain coagulation factors are low or missing. Bleeding problems can range from mild to severe.; Some bleeding disorders are present at birth and are passed down through families (inherited). Others develop from:; Bleeding disorders can also result from a problem with the number or function of platelets. These disorders can also be either inherited or develop later (acquired). The side effects of certain drugs often lead to the acquired forms.; Illnesses, such as vitamin K deficiency or severe liver disease; Treatments, such as the use of drugs to stop blood clots (anticoagulants) or the long-term use of antibiotics"
001305,Glanzmann thrombasthenia,Glanzmann's disease; Thrombasthenia - Glanzmann,Symptoms may include any of the following:; Heavy bleeding during and after surgery; Bleeding gums; Bruising easily or pinpoint red spots on the skin; Heavy menstrual bleeding; Nosebleeds that do not stop easily; Prolonged bleeding with minor injuries,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia is caused by the lack of a protein that is normally on the surface of platelets. This substance is needed for platelets to clump together to plug up bleeding spots and begin forming a clot.; The condition is congenital, which means it is present from birth. There are several genetic abnormalities that can cause the condition."
001306,ABO incompatibility,Transfusion reaction - hemolytic; Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction; AHTR; Blood incompatibility - ABO,The following are symptoms of ABO incompatible transfusion reactions:; Low back pain; Blood in urine; Chills; Feeling of impending doom; Fever; Nausea and vomiting; Shortness of breath; Increased heart rate; Pain at infusion site; Chest pain; Dizziness; Bronchospasm (spasm of the muscles lining the lung; causes cough); Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice); Acute kidney failure; Low blood pressure; Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),"The different blood types are:; People who have one blood type may form proteins (antibodies) that cause their immune system to react against one or more of the other blood types.; Being exposed to another type of blood can cause a reaction. This is important when someone needs to receive a blood transfusion or have an organ transplant. The blood types must be compatible to avoid an ABO incompatibility reaction.; For example:; Type O blood does not cause an immune response when it is given to people with type A, type B, or type AB blood. This is why type O blood cells can be given to people of any blood type. People with type O blood are called universal donors. But people with type O can only receive type O blood.; Both blood and plasma transfusions must be matched to avoid an immune reaction. Before anyone receives blood, both the blood and the person receiving it are tested carefully to avoid a reaction. Usually, a reaction occurs because of a clerical error causing someone to receive incompatible blood.; Type A; Type B; Type AB; Type O; People with type A blood will react against type B or type AB blood.; People with type B blood will react against type A or type AB blood.; People with type O blood will react against type A, type B, or type AB blood.; People with type AB blood will not react against type A, type B, type AB, or type O blood."

It is caused by a gene defect that blocks the growth of normal, mature immune cells called B lymphocytes.; As a result, the body makes very little (if any) immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins play a major role in the immune response, which protects against illness and infection.; People with this disorder develop infections again and again. Common infections include ones that are due to bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci (Streptococcus pneumoniae), and staphylococci. Common sites of infection include:; Agammaglobulinemia is inherited, which means other people in your family may have the condition.; Gastrointestinal tract; Joints; Lungs; Skin; Upper respiratory tract"
001308,Burkitt lymphoma,B-cell lymphoma; High-grade B-cell lymphoma; Small noncleaved cell lymphoma; Burkitt's lymphoma,"BL may first be noticed as a swelling of the lymph nodes (glands) in the head and neck. These swollen lymph nodes are often painless, but can grow very rapidly.; In the types commonly seen in the United States, the cancer often starts in the belly area (abdomen). The disease can also start in the ovaries, testes, brain, kidneys, liver, and spinal fluid.; Other general symptoms may include:; Fever; Night sweats; Unexplained weight loss","BL was first discovered in children in certain parts of Africa. It also occurs in the United States.; The African type of BL is closely associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the main cause of infectious mononucleosis. The North American form of BL is not commonly linked to EBV.; People with HIV/AIDS have an increased risk for this condition. BL is most often seen in males."
001309,Graft-versus-host disease,GVHD; Bone marrow transplant - graft-versus-host disease; Stem cell transplant - graft-versus-host disease; Allogeneic transplant - GVHD,"There are two types of GVHD: acute and chronic. Symptoms in both acute and chronic GVHD range from mild to severe.; Acute GVHD usually happens within days or as late as 6 months after a transplant. The immune system, skin, liver, and intestines are mainly affected. Common acute symptoms include:; Chronic GVHD usually starts more than 3 months after a transplant, and can last a lifetime. Chronic symptoms may include:; Abdominal pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; Jaundice (yellow coloring of the skin or eyes) or other liver problems; Skin rash, itching, redness on areas of the skin; Increased risk for infections; Dry eyes, burning sensation, or vision changes; Dry mouth, white patches inside the mouth, and sensitivity to spicy foods; Fatigue, muscle weakness, and chronic pain; Joint pain or stiffness; Skin rash with raised, discolored areas, as well as skin tightening or thickening; Shortness of breath due to lung damage; Vaginal dryness; Weight loss; Reduced bile flow from the liver; Brittle hair and premature graying; Damage to sweat glands; Cytopenia (decrease in number of mature blood cells); Pericarditis (inflammation in the membrane surrounding the heart; causes chest pain)","GVHD may occur after a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in which someone receives bone marrow tissue or cells from a donor. This type of transplant is called allogeneic. The new, transplanted cells regard the recipient's body as foreign. When this happens, the cells attack the recipient's body.; GVHD does not occur when people receive their own cells. This type of transplant is called autologous.; Before a transplant, tissue and cells from possible donors are checked to see how closely they match the recipient. GVHD is less likely to occur, or symptoms will be milder, when the match is close. The chance of GVHD is:; Around 35% to 45% when the donor and recipient are related; Around 60% to 80% when the donor and recipient are not related"
001310,Tumor,Mass; Neoplasm,"Symptoms depend on the type and location of the tumor. For example, lung tumors may cause coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Tumors of the colon can cause weight loss, diarrhea, constipation, iron deficiency anemia, and blood in the stool.; Some tumors may not cause any symptoms. Others, such as esophageal or pancreatic cancer, MAY NOT cause symptoms until the disease has reached an advanced stage.; The following symptoms may occur with tumors:; Fever or chills; Fatigue; Loss of appetite; Night sweats; Weight loss; Pain","In general, tumors occur when cells divide and grow excessively in the body. Normally, the body controls cell growth and division. New cells are created to replace older ones or to perform new functions. Cells that are damaged or no longer needed die to make room for healthy replacements.; If the balance of cell growth and death is disturbed, a tumor may form.; Problems with the body's immune system can lead to tumors. Tobacco causes more deaths from cancer than any other environmental substance. Other risk factors for cancer include:; Types of tumors known to be caused by or linked with viruses are:; Some tumors are more common in one sex than the other. Some are more common among children or older adults.

001311,Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome,Job syndrome; Hyper IgE syndrome,"Symptoms include:; Bone and tooth defects, including fractures and losing the baby teeth late; Eczema; Skin abscesses and infection; Repeated sinus infections; Repeated lung infections","Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is also called Job syndrome. It is named after the biblical character Job, whose faithfulness was tested by an affliction with draining skin sores and pustules. People with this condition have long-term, severe skin infections.; The symptoms are most often present in childhood, but because the disease is so rare, it often takes years before a correct diagnosis is made.; Recent research suggests that the disease is often caused by a genetic change that takes place in the STAT3gene on chromosome 17. How this gene abnormality causes the symptoms of the disease is not well understood. However, people with the disease have a higher-than-normal level of a type of antibody called IgE."
001312,Chediak-Higashi syndrome,,"Children with this condition may have:; Infection of affected children with certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), can cause a life-threatening illness resembling the blood cancer lymphoma called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.; Other symptoms may include:; Silver hair, light-colored eyes (albinism); Increased infections in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes; Jerky eye movements (nystagmus); Decreased vision; Intellectual disability; Muscle weakness; Nerve problems in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy); Nosebleeds or easy bruising; Numbness; Tremor; Seizures; Sensitivity to bright light (photophobia); Unsteady walking (ataxia)",Chediak-Higashi syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). It is an autosomal recessive disease. This means that both parents are carriers of a non-working copy of the gene. Each parent must pass their non-working gene to the child for them to show symptoms of the disease.; Defects have been found in the LYST (also called CHS1) gene. The primary defect in this disease is found in certain substances normally present in skin cells and certain white blood cells.
001313,Congenital fibrinogen deficiency,Afibrinogenemia; Hypofibrinogenemia; Dysfibrinogenemia; Factor I deficiency,People with a complete lack of fibrinogen may have any of the following bleeding symptoms:; People with a reduced level of fibrinogen bleed less often and the bleeding is not as severe when compared to people with no fibrinogen at all. Those with a problem with the function of fibrinogen often don't have symptoms.; Bruising easily; Bleeding from the umbilical cord just after birth; Bleeding in the mucous membranes; Bleeding in the brain (very rare); Bleeding in the joints; Heavy bleeding after injury or surgery; Nosebleeds that do not stop easily,"This disease is due to a deficiency of the amount or function of fibrinogen. How fibrinogen is affected depends on how the genes that determine how it is formed are inherited:; When the abnormal gene is passed down from both parents, a person will have a complete lack of fibrinogen (afibrinogenemia).; When the abnormal gene is passed down from one parent, a person will have either a reduced level of fibrinogen (hypofibrinogenemia) or a problem with the function of fibrinogen (dysfibrinogenemia). Sometimes, these two fibrinogen problems can occur in the same person."

Rabies is spread by infected saliva that enters the body through a bite or broken skin. The virus travels from the wound to the brain, where it causes swelling or inflammation. This inflammation leads to symptoms of the disease. Most rabies deaths occur in children.; In the past, human rabies cases in the United States usually resulted from a dog bite. Recently, more cases of human rabies have been linked to bats and raccoons. Dog bites are a common cause of rabies in developing countries, especially Asia and Africa. There have been no reports of rabies caused by dog bites in the United States for a number of years due to widespread animal vaccination.; Other wild animals that can spread the rabies virus include:; Bats can spread rabies through minor or unrecognized bites or scratches. Bites can be so small you may not realize you have been bitten. If you find a bat in your home, you should contact your health care provider or health department, even if you don't feel or see a bite.

001341,Yaws,Frambesia tropica,"About 2 to 4 weeks after infection, the person develops a sore called a ""mother yaw"" where bacteria enter the skin. The sore may be tan or reddish and looks like a raspberry. It is most often painless, but does cause itching.; The sores may last for months. More sores may appear shortly before or after the mother yaw heals. Scratching the sore can spread the bacteria from the mother yaw to uninfected skin. Eventually, the skin sores heal.; Other symptoms include:; In the advanced stage, sores on the skin and bones can lead to severe disfigurement and disability. This occurs in up to 1 in 5 people who do not get antibiotic treatment.; Bone pain; Scarring of the skin; Swelling of the bones and fingers","Yaws is an infection caused by a form of the Treponema pallidum bacteria. It is closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis, but this form of the bacterium is not sexually transmitted.

001342,Noma,Cancrum oris; Gangrenous stomatitis,"Noma causes sudden tissue destruction that rapidly gets worse. First, the gums and lining of the cheeks become inflamed and develop sores (ulcers). The ulcers develop a foul-smelling drainage, causing bad breath and skin odor.; The infection spreads to the skin, and the tissues in the lips and cheeks die. This can eventually destroy the soft tissue and bone. The destruction of the bones around the mouth causes deformity of the face and loss of teeth.; Noma can also affect the genitals, spreading to the genital skin (this is sometimes called noma pudendi).","The exact cause is unknown, but noma may be due to a certain kind of bacteria.; This disorder most often occurs in young, severely malnourished children from ages 2 to 5 years.

It also takes a long time before symptoms appear, which makes it hard to know where or when someone caught the disease. Children are more likely than adults to get the disease.; Most people who come in contact with the bacteria don't develop the disease. This is because their immune system is able to fight off the bacteria. Experts believe that the bacteria spread when a person breathes in tiny airborne droplets released when someone with leprosy coughs or sneezes. The bacteria may also be passed through contact with the nasal fluids of a person with leprosy. Leprosy has two common forms: tuberculoid and lepromatous. Both forms produce sores on the skin. However, the lepromatous form is more severe. It causes large lumps and bumps (nodules).; Leprosy is common in many countries worldwide including India, Brazil and Indonesia.

This consists of shaking chills, followed by intense sweating, falling body temperature, and low blood pressure. This stage may result in death.; In the United States, TBRF often occurs west of the Mississippi River, particularly in the mountains of the West and the high deserts and plains of the Southwest. In the mountains of California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, infections are usually caused by Borrelia hermsii and are often picked up in cabins in forests. The risk may now extend into the southeastern United States.; LBRF is mainly a disease of the developing world. It is currently seen in Ethiopia and Sudan. Famine, war, and the movement of refugee groups can result in clusters of LBRF epidemics.; Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is transmitted by the ornithodoros tick. It occurs in Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Asia, and certain areas in the western United States and Canada. The bacteria species associated with TBRF are Borrelia duttonii, Borrelia hermsii, and Borrelia parkeri.; Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is transmitted by body lice.

The bacteria produce a toxin that causes skin damage. The damage creates blisters, as if the skin were scalded by heat. These blisters can occur at areas of the skin away from the initial site.; SSS is found most commonly in infants and children under the age of 5."
001353,Abscess,,,"Abscesses occur when an area of tissue becomes infected and the body's immune system tries to fight and contain it. White blood cells (WBCs) move through the walls of the blood vessels into the area of the infection and collect in the damaged tissue. During this process, pus forms. Pus is the buildup of fluid, living and dead white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other foreign substances.; Abscesses can form in almost any part of the body. The skin, under the skin, and the teeth are the most common sites. Abscesses may be caused by bacteria, parasites, and foreign substances.; Abscesses in the skin are easy to see.

They may include:; Backache; Delirium; Diarrhea; Excessive bleeding; Fatigue; High fever; Malaise; Raised pink rash, turns into sores that become crusty on day 8 or 9; Severe headache; Nausea and vomiting","Smallpox spreads from one person to another from saliva droplets. It may also be spread from bed sheets and clothing. It is most contagious during the first week of the infection. It may continue to be contagious until the scabs from the rash fall off. The virus can stay alive between 6 and 24 hours.; People were once vaccinated against this disease. However, the disease has been eradicated since 1979. The United States stopped giving the smallpox vaccine in 1972. In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that all countries stop vaccinating for smallpox.; There are two forms of smallpox:; A massive program by the WHO wiped out all known smallpox viruses from the world in the 1970s, except for a few samples saved for government research and presumed bioweapons. Researchers continue to debate whether or not to kill the last remaining samples of the virus or to preserve it in case there may be some future reason to study it.; You are more likely to develop smallpox if you:; It is unknown how long past vaccinations stay effective. People who received the vaccine many years ago may no longer be fully protected against the virus.; THE RISK OF TERRORISM; There is a concern that the smallpox virus could be spread as part of a terrorist attack. The virus could be spread in spray (aerosol) form.; Variola major is a serious illness that can be life threatening in people who have not been vaccinated. It was responsible for a large number of deaths.; Variola minor is a milder infection that rarely causes death.; Are a laboratory worker who handles the virus (rare); Are in a location where the virus was released as a biological weapon"

The knees and legs are other areas affected.; The nodules may break down, ulcerate, and leave an open sore. Sometimes, they spread up through the lymph nodes of the limb, but more often remain as a solitary nodule.; Since the bacteria cannot survive at the temperature of the internal organs, they usually stay in the skin, causing the nodules.","M marinum bacteria can live in fresh and salt water, unchlorinated swimming pools, and aquarium tanks. The bacteria can enter the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut, when you come into contact with water that contains this bacteria.; Signs of a skin infection appear about 2 to 3 weeks after exposure.; Risks include exposure of skin cuts or scrapes to swimming pools, aquariums, or fish or amphibians that are infected with the bacteria. As a result, people who fish or maintain aquariums and fish tanks are at higher risk."

These may include:; Changes in handwriting; Loss of fine motor control, especially of the fingers and hands; Loss of emotional control, with bouts of inappropriate crying or laughing; High fever; Heart problem; Joint pain or swelling; Skin lumps or skin rashes; Nosebleeds","Sydenham chorea is caused by an infection with bacteria called group A streptococcus. This is the bacteria that causes rheumatic fever (RF) and strep throat. Group A streptococcus bacteria can trigger an immune response that reacts with a part of the brain called the basal ganglia to cause this disorder. The basal ganglia are a set of structures deep in the brain. They help control movement, posture, and speech.; Sydenham chorea is a major sign of acute RF. The person may currently or recently have had the disease. Sydenham chorea may be the only sign of RF in some people.; Sydenham chorea occurs most often in girls before puberty, but may be seen in boys."
001359,Tick paralysis,,"Children with tick paralysis develop an unsteady gait followed several days later by weakness in the lower legs. This weakness gradually moves up to involve the upper limbs.; Paralysis may cause breathing difficulties, which may require the use of a breathing machine.; The child may also have mild, flu-like symptoms (muscle aches, tiredness).",Hard-bodied and soft-bodied female ticks are believed to make a poison that can cause paralysis in children. Ticks attach to the skin to feed on blood. The poison enters the bloodstream during this feeding process.; The paralysis is ascending. That means it starts in the lower body and moves up.
001360,Congenital toxoplasmosis,,"Up to half babies who become infected with toxoplasmosis during the pregnancy are born early (prematurely). The infection can damage the baby's eyes, nervous system, skin, and ears.; Often, there are signs of infection at birth.

It is spread by lice.; Brill-Zinsser disease is a mild form of epidemic typhus. It occurs when the bacteria become active again in a person who was previously infected. It is more common in older adults.; Endemic typhus is uncommon in the United States. It is usually seen in areas where hygiene is poor, and the temperature is cold. Endemic typhus is sometimes called ""jail fever."" The bacteria that cause this type of typhus is usually spread from rats to fleas to humans.; Murine typhus occurs in the southern United States, including California and Texas. It is often seen during the summer and fall. It is rarely deadly.

GBS septicemia is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus agalactiae, which is commonly called group B strep, or GBS.; GBS is commonly found in adults and older children and usually does not cause infection. But it can make newborn babies very sick. There are two ways in which GBS can be passed to a newborn baby:; GBS septicemia now occurs less often, because there are methods to screen and treat pregnant women whose babies are at risk.; The following increase an infant's risk for GBS septicemia:; The baby can become infected while passing through the birth canal. In this case, babies become ill between birth and 6 days of life (most often in the first 24 hours). This is called early-onset GBS disease.; The infant may also become infected after delivery by coming into contact with people who carry the GBS germ. In this case, symptoms appear later, when the baby is 7 days to 3 months or more old. This is called late-onset GBS disease.; Being born more than 3 weeks before the due date (prematurity), especially if the mother goes into labor early (preterm labor) and has not been screened for GBS; Mother who has already given birth to a baby with GBS sepsis; Mother who has a fever of 100.4Â°F (38Â°C) or higher during labor and has not been screened for GBS; Mother who has GBS in her gastrointestinal, reproductive, or urinary tract; Rupture of membranes (water breaks) more than 18 hours before the baby is delivered in a mother who has not been screened for GBS"

Half of tumors are present at birth. Neuroblastoma is most commonly diagnosed in children before the age of 5. Each year there are around 700 new cases in the United States. The disorder is slightly more common in boys.; In most people, the tumor has spread when it is first diagnosed."
001409,Spasmus nutans,,"Symptoms of spasmus nutans include:; Small, quick, side-to-side eye movements called nystagmus (both eyes are involved, but each eye may move differently); Head nodding; Head tilting","Most cases of spasmus nutans begin between age 6 months and 1 year. It usually lasts about 2 years but can go on as long as 5 years.; The cause is unknown, although it may be associated with other medical conditions. A link with iron or vitamin D deficiency has been suggested. In very rare cases, symptoms similar to spasmus nutans may be due to certain types of brain tumors or other serious conditions."
001410,Facial tics,Tic - facial; Mimic spasm,"Tics may involve repeated, uncontrolled spasm-like muscle movements, such as:; Repeated throat clearing or grunting may also be present.Â; Eye blinking; Grimacing; Mouth twitching; Nose wrinkling; Squinting","Tics most often occur in children, but may last into adulthood. Tics occur 3 to 4 times as often in boys as girls. Tics may affect as many as one quarter of all children at some time.; The cause of tics is unknown, but stress appears to make tics worse.; Short-lived tics (transient tic disorder) are common in childhood.; A chronic motor tic disorder also exists. It may last for years. This form is very rare compared to the common short-lived childhood tic. Tourette syndrome is a separate condition in which tics are a major symptom."
001411,Friedreich ataxia,Friedreich's ataxia; Spinocerebellar degeneration,"Symptoms are caused by the wearing away of structures in areas of the brain and spinal cord that control coordination, muscle movement, and other functions. Symptoms most often begin before puberty. Symptoms may include:; Muscle problems lead to changes in the spine. This may result in scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis.; Heart disease most often develops and may lead to heart failure. Heart failure or dysrhythmias that do not respond to treatment may result in death. Diabetes may develop in later stages of the disease.; Abnormal speech; Changes in vision, particularly color vision; Decrease in ability to feel vibrations in lower limbs; Foot problems, such as hammer toe and high arches; Hearing loss, this occurs in about 10% of people; Jerky eye movements; Loss of coordination and balance, which leads to frequent falls; Muscle weakness; No reflexes in the legs; Unsteady gait and uncoordinated movements (ataxia), which gets worse with time","Friedreich ataxia is caused by a defect in a gene called frataxin (FXN). Changes in this gene cause the body to make too much of a part of DNA called trinucleotide repeat (GAA). Normally, the body contains about 8 to 30 copies of GAA. People with Friedreich ataxia have as many as 1,000 copies. The more copies of GAA a person has, the earlier in life the disease starts and the faster it gets worse.; Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means you must get a copy of the defective gene from both your mother and father."
001412,Epidural hematoma,Extradural hematoma; Extradural hemorrhage; Epidural hemorrhage; EDH,"Contact your health care provider for any head injury that results in even a brief loss of consciousness, or if there are any other symptoms after a head injury (even without loss of consciousness).; The typical pattern of symptoms that indicate an EDH is a loss of consciousness, followed by alertness, then loss of consciousness again. But this pattern may not appear in all people.; The most important symptoms of an EDH are:; The symptoms usually occur within minutes to hours after a head injury and indicate an emergency situation.; Sometimes, bleeding does not start for hours after a head injury. The symptoms of pressure on the brain also do not occur right away.; Confusion; Dizziness; Drowsiness or altered level of alertness; Enlarged pupil in one eye; Headache (severe); Head injury or trauma followed by loss of consciousness, a period of alertness, then rapid deterioration back to unconsciousness; Nausea or vomiting; Weakness in part of the body, usually on the opposite side from the side with the enlarged pupil; Seizures can occur as a result of head impact","An EDH is often caused by a skull fracture during childhood or adolescence. The membrane covering the brain is not as closely attached to the skull as it is in older people and children younger than 2 years. Therefore, this type of bleeding is more common in young people.; An EDH can also occur due to rupture of a blood vessel, usually an artery. The blood vessel then bleeds into the space between the dura and the skull.; The affected vessels are often torn by skull fractures. The fractures are most often the result of a severe head injury, such as those caused by motorcycle, bicycle, skateboard, snow boarding, or automobile accidents. Less severe blunt trauma, such as getting hit by a baseball, can also result in an EDH.; Rapid bleeding causes a collection of blood (hematoma) that presses on the brain. The pressure inside the head (intracranial pressure, ICP) increases quickly. This pressure may result in more brain injury."
001413,Bruxism,Teeth grinding; Clenching,"Grinding your teeth puts pressure on the muscles, tissues, and other structures around your jaw. The symptoms can cause temporomandibular joint problems (TMJ).; Grinding can wear down your teeth. It can be noisy enough at night to bother sleeping partners.; Symptoms of bruxism include:; Anxiety, stress, and tension; Depression; Earache (partly because the structures of the temporomandibular joint are very close to the ear canal, and because you can feel pain in a different location than its source; this is called referred pain); Eating disorders; Headache; Muscle tenderness, especially in the morning; Hot, cold, or sweet sensitivity in the teeth; Insomnia; Sore or painful jaw",People can clench and grind without being aware of it. It can happen during the day and night. Bruxism during sleep is often a bigger problem because it is harder to control.; There is some disagreement about the cause of bruxism. Daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench or grind their teeth and never feel symptoms.; Factors that influence whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems will vary from person to person. They may include:; How much stress you have; How long and how tightly you clench and grind your teeth; Whether your teeth are misaligned; Your posture; Your ability to relax; Your diet; Your sleeping habits
001414,Aneurysm in the brain,Aneurysm - cerebral; Cerebral aneurysm; Aneurysm - intracranial,"A person may have an aneurysm without having any symptoms. This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason.; A brain aneurysm may begin to leak a small amount of blood. This may cause a severe headache that a person may describe as ""the worst headache of my life."" It may be called a thunderclap or sentinel headache. This means the headache could be a warning sign of a future rupture that may occur days to weeks after the headache first started.; Symptoms may also occur if the aneurysm pushes on nearby structures in the brain or breaks open (ruptures) and causes bleeding into the brain.; Symptoms depend on the location of the aneurysm, whether it breaks open, and what part of the brain it is pushing on. Symptoms may include:; A sudden, severe headache is one symptom of an aneurysm that has ruptured. Other symptoms of an aneurysm rupture may include:; NOTE: A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency. Call 911 or the local emergency number.; Double vision; Loss of vision; Headaches; Eye pain; Neck pain; Stiff neck; Ringing in the ears; Confusion, no energy, sleepiness, orÂ stupor; Eyelid drooping; Headaches with nausea or vomiting; Muscle weakness or difficulty moving any part of the body; Numbness or decreased sensation in any part of the body; Problems speaking; Seizures; Stiff neck (occasionally); Vision changes (double vision, loss of vision); Loss of consciousness (coma)","AneurysmsÂ around the brain occur when there is a weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm may be present from birth (congenital). Or, it may develop later in life.; There are many types of brain aneurysms. The most common type is called a berry aneurysm. This type can vary in size from a few millimeters (mm) to over a centimeter (cm). Giant berry aneurysms can be bigger than 2.5 cm or 1 inch (in). These are more common in adults. Berry aneurysms, especially when there is more than one, are sometimes passed down through families.; Other types of cerebral aneurysms involve widening of an entire blood vessel (fusiform aneurysms). Aneurysms can occur in any blood vessel that supplies the brain. Hardening of arteries (atherosclerosis), trauma, and infection can all injure the blood vessel wall and cause cerebral aneurysms.; Brain aneurysms are relatively common. One in 50 people has a brain aneurysm, but only a small number of these aneurysms cause symptoms or rupture.; Risk factors include:; Family history of cerebral aneurysms; Medical problems such as polycystic kidney disease, coarctation of the aorta, and endocarditis; High blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, and cocaine, methamphetamine, or amphetamine drug use"
001415,Encephalitis,,"Some people may have symptoms of a cold or stomach infection before encephalitis symptoms begin.; When this infection is not very severe, the symptoms may be similar to those of other illnesses:; Other symptoms include:; Symptoms in newborns and younger infants may not be as easy to recognize:; Emergency symptoms:; Fever that is not very high; Mild headache; Low energy and a poor appetite; Clumsiness, unsteady gait; Confusion, disorientation; Drowsiness; Irritability or poor temper control; Light sensitivity; Stiff neck and back (sometimes); Vomiting; Body stiffness; Irritability and crying more often (these symptoms may get worse when the baby is picked up); Poor feeding; Soft spot on the top of the head may bulge out more; Vomiting; Loss of consciousness, poor responsiveness, stupor, coma; Muscle weakness or paralysis; Seizures; Severe headache; Sudden change in mental functions, such as flat mood, impaired judgment, memory loss, or a lack of interest in daily activities","Encephalitis is a rare condition. It occurs more often in the first year of life and decreases with age. The very young and older adults are more likely to have a severe case.; Encephalitis is most often caused by a virus. Many types of viruses may cause it. Exposure can occur through:; Different viruses occur in different geographic locations. Many cases occur during a certain season.; Encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus is the leading cause of more severe cases in all ages, including newborns.; Routine vaccination has greatly reduced encephalitis due to some viruses, including:; Other viruses that cause encephalitis include:; After the virus enters the body, the brain tissue swells. This swelling may destroy nerve cells, and cause bleeding in the brain and brain damage.; Other causes of encephalitis may include:; Breathing in droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat from an infected person; Contaminated food or drink; Mosquito, tick, and other insect bites; Skin contact; Measles; Mumps; Polio; Rabies; Rubella; Varicella (chickenpox); Adenovirus; Coxsackievirus; Cytomegalovirus; Eastern equine encephalitis virus; Echovirus; Japanese encephalitis, which occurs in Asia; West Nile virus; An allergic reaction to vaccinations; Autoimmune disease; Bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis; Parasites such as roundworms, cysticercosis, and toxoplasmosis in people with HIV/AIDS and other people who have a weakened immune system; The effects of cancer"

This infection is called an intracranial epidural abscess if it is inside the skull area. It is called a spinal epidural abscess if it is found in the spine area. Most are located in the spine.; The spinal infection is usually caused by bacteria but may be caused by a fungus. It can be due to other infections in the body (especially a urinary tract infection), or germs that spread through the blood. In some people, though, no other source of infection is found.; An abscess inside the skull is called an intracranial epidural abscess. The cause may be any of the following:; An abscess of the spine is called a spinal epidural abscess. It may be seen in people with any of the following:; People who inject drugs are also at increased risk.; Chronic ear infections; Chronic sinusitis; Head injury; Mastoiditis; Recent neurosurgery; Prior back surgery or another invasive procedure involving the spine; Bloodstream infections; Boils, especially on the back or scalp; Bone infections of the spine (vertebral osteomyelitis)"
001417,Tay-Sachs disease,GM2 gangliosidosis - Tay-Sachs; Lysosomal storage disease - Tay-Sachs disease,"Symptoms may include any of the following:; Deafness; Decreased eye contact, blindness; Decreased muscle tone (loss of muscle strength), loss of motor skills, paralysis; Slow growth and delayed mental and social skills; Dementia (loss of brain function); Increased startle reaction; Irritability; Listlessness; Seizures","Tay-Sachs disease occurs when the body lacks hexosaminidase A. This is a protein that helps break down a group of chemicals found in nerve tissue called gangliosides. Without this protein, gangliosides, particularly ganglioside GM2, build up in cells, often nerve cells in the brain.; Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a defective gene on chromosome 15. When both parents carry the defective Tay-Sachs gene, a child has a 25% chance of developing the disease. The child must receive two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent, in order to become sick. If only one parent passes the defective gene to the child, the child is called a carrier. They will not be sick, but may pass the disease to their own children.; Anyone can be a carrier of the Tay-Sachs gene. But, the disease is most common among people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, where 1 in every 27 people carries the Tay-Sachs gene.; Tay-Sachs is divided into infantile, juvenile, and adult forms, depending on the symptoms and when they first appear. Most people with Tay-Sachs have the infantile form. In this form, the nerve damage usually begins while the baby is still in the womb. Symptoms usually appear when the child is 3 to 6 months old. The disease tends to get worse very quickly, and the child usually dies by age 4 or 5.; Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, which affects adults, is very rare."
001418,Brachial plexopathy,Neuropathy - brachial plexus; Brachial plexus dysfunction; Parsonage-Turner syndrome; Pancoast syndrome,"Symptoms may include:; Numbness of the shoulder, arm, or hand; Shoulder pain; Tingling, burning, pain, or abnormal sensations (location depends on the area injured); Weakness of the shoulder, arm, hand, or wrist","Damage to the brachial plexus may occur due to:; Brachial plexus dysfunction may also be associated with:; In some cases, no cause can be identified.; Direct injury to the nerve; Stretching injuries (including birth trauma); Pressure from tumors in the area (especially from lung tumors); Damage from radiation therapy; Birth defects that put pressure on the neck area; Exposure to toxins, chemicals, or medicines and illegal drugs; General anesthesia, used during surgery; Inflammatory conditions, such as those due to a virus or immune system problem; Hereditary causes, such as hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy"
001419,Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,SSPE; Subacute sclerosing leukoencephalitis; Dawson encephalitis; Measles - SSPE; Rubeola - SSPE,"Symptoms of SSPE occur in four general stages. With each stage, the symptoms are worse than the stage before:; Stage I: There may be personality changes, mood swings, or depression. Fever and headache may also be present. This stage may last up to 6 months.; Stage II: There may be uncontrolled movement problems including jerking and muscle spasms. Other symptoms that may occur in this stage are loss of vision, dementia, and seizures.; Stage III: Jerking movements are replaced by writhing (twisting) movements and rigidity. Death may occur from complications.; Stage IV: Areas of the brain that regulate breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure are damaged. This leads to coma and then death.","Normally, the measles virus does not cause brain damage. However, an abnormal immune response to measles or, possibly, certain variant forms of the virus may cause severe illness and death. This response leads to brain inflammation (swelling and irritation) that may last for years.; SSPE has been reported in all parts of the world, but in western countries it is a rare disease.; Very few cases are seen in the United States since the nationwide measles vaccination program began. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally occurs in children and adolescents."
001420,Benign positional vertigo,Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV; Dizziness - positional,"BPPV symptoms include any of the following:; The spinning sensation:; Certain positions can trigger the spinning feeling:; Feeling like you are spinning or moving; Feeling like the world is spinning around you; Loss of balance; Nausea and vomiting; Hearing loss; Vision problems, such as a feeling that things are jumping or moving; Is usually triggered by moving your head; Often starts suddenly; Lasts a few seconds to minutes; Rolling over in bed; Tilting your head up to look at something","Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.; The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.; BPPV occurs when small pieces of bone-like calcium (called canaliths) break free and float inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.; BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk of developing BPPV may increase if you have:; Family members with BPPV; Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head); Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis"

Subdural effusion is more common in infants.; It may also occur after head trauma.
001423,Vertebrobasilar circulatory disorders,Vertebrobasilar insufficiency; Posterior circulation ischemia; Beauty parlor syndrome; TIA - vertebrobasilar insufficiency; Dizziness - vertebrobasilar insufficiency; Vertigo - vertebrobasilar insufficiency,"Common symptoms may include:; Other symptoms may include:; Difficulty pronouncing words, slurred speech; Difficulty swallowing; Double vision or vision loss; Numbness or tingling, most often on the face or scalp; Sudden falls (drop attacks); Vertigo (sensation of things spinning around); Memory loss; Bladder or bowel control problems; Difficulty walking (unsteady gait); Headache, neck ache; Hearing loss; Muscle weakness; Nausea and vomiting; Pain in one or more parts of the body, which gets worse with touch and cold temperatures; Poor coordination; Sleepiness or sleep from which the person cannot be awakened; Sudden, uncoordinated movements; Sweating on the face, arms, or legs","In the neck, two vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery, which enters the skull. These are the main blood vessels that provide blood flow to the back of the brain.; The areas in the back of the brain that receive blood from these arteries are needed to keep a person alive. These areas regulate breathing, heart rate, swallowing, vision, movement, and posture or balance. All of the nervous system signals that connect the brain to the rest of the body pass through the back of the brain.; Many different conditions may reduce or stop blood flow in the back part of the brain. The most common risk factors are smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, increased age, and a high cholesterol level. These are similar to the risk factors for any stroke.; Other causes include:; Tear in the wall of an artery; Blood clots in the heart that travel to the vertebral or basilar arteries and cause a stroke; Blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis); Connective tissue diseases; Problems in the spinal bones of the neck; Outside pressure on the vertebral or basilar arteries, such as from a salon sink (nicknamed beauty parlor syndrome)"
001424,Myotonia congenita,Thomsen's disease; Becker's disease,"The hallmark of this condition is myotonia. This means the muscles are unable to quickly relax after contracting. For example, after a handshake, the person is only very slowly able to open and pull away their hand.; Early symptoms may include:; Children with myotonia congenita often look muscular and well-developed. They may not have symptoms of myotonia congenita until age 2 or 3.; Difficulty swallowing; Gagging; Stiff movements that improve when they are repeated; Shortness of breath or tightening of the chest at the beginning of exercise; Frequent falls; Difficulty opening eyes after forcing them closed or crying","Myotonia congenita is caused by a genetic change (genetic variant). It is passed down from either one or both parents to their children (inherited).; Myotonia congenita is caused by a problem in the part of the muscle cells that are needed for muscles to relax. Abnormal repeated electrical signals occur in the muscles, causing a type of muscle stiffness called myotonia."
001425,Facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma,Seventh cranial nerve palsy due to birth trauma; Facial palsy - birth trauma; Facial palsy - neonate; Facial palsy - infant,"The most common form of facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma involves only the lower part of the facial nerve.

In infants, it can be damaged just before or at the time of delivery.; Most of the time, the cause is unknown. But a difficult delivery, with or without the use of an instrument called forceps, may lead to this condition.; Some factors that can increase the risk of birth trauma (injury) include:; Most of the time, these factors do not lead to facial nerve palsy or birth trauma.; Use of epidural anesthesia and medicines to induce labor and contractions indicate more difficult deliveries, which are at greater risk of complications such as nerve injury.; Large baby size (may be seen if the mother has diabetes); Long pregnancy or labor"
001426,Sturge-Weber syndrome,Encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis; SWS,Symptoms of SWS include:; Port-wine stain (more common on the upper face and eyelid than the rest of the body); Seizures; Headache; Paralysis or weakness on one side; Learning disabilities; Glaucoma (very high fluid pressure in the eye); Low thyroid function (hypothyroidism),"In many people, the cause of Sturge-Weber is due to a variation of the GNAQ gene. This gene affects small blood vessels called capillaries in some but not all body cells. Problems in the capillaries cause the port-wine stains to form.; Sturge-Weber is not thought to be passed down (inherited) through families."
001427,Stuttering,Children and stuttering; Speech disfluency; Stammering; Childhood onset fluency disorder; Cluttering; Physical concomitants,"Stuttering may start with repeating consonants (k, g, t). If stuttering becomes worse, words and phrases are repeated.; Later, vocal spasms develop. There is a forced, almost explosive sound to speech. The person may appear to be struggling to speak.; Stressful social situations and anxiety can make symptoms worse.; Symptoms of stuttering may include:; Other symptoms that might be seen with stuttering include:; Children with mild stuttering are often unaware of their stuttering. In severe cases, children may be more aware. Facial movements, anxiety, and increased stuttering may occur when they are asked to speak.; Some people who stutter find that they do not stutter when they read aloud or sing.; Feeling frustrated when trying to communicate; Pausing or hesitating when starting or during sentences, phrases, or words, often with the lips together; Putting in (interjecting) extra sounds or words (""We went to the...uh...store""); Repeating sounds, words, parts of words, or phrases (""I want...I want my doll,"" ""I...I see you,"" or ""Ca-ca-ca-can""); Tension in the voice; Very long sounds within words (""I am Booooobbbby Jones"" or ""Llllllllike""); Eye blinking; Jerking of the head or other body parts; Jaw jerking; Clenching fist","Stuttering usually affects children ages 2 to 5 years and is more common in boys. It may last for several weeks to several years.; For a small number of children, stuttering does not go away and may get worse. This is called developmental stuttering and it is the most common type of stuttering.; Stuttering tends to run in families. Genes that cause stuttering have been identified.; There is also evidence that stuttering may be a result of brain injuries, such as stroke or traumatic brain injuries.; In rare cases, stuttering is caused by emotional trauma (called psychogenic stuttering).; Stuttering persists into adulthood more in boys than in girls."

It develops naturally, along with other signs of normal growth and development. Disorders of speech and language are common in preschool age children.; Disfluencies are disorders in which a person repeats a sound, word, or phrase. Stuttering may be the most serious disfluency. It may be caused by:; Articulation and phonological disorders may occur in other family members. Other causes include:; Voice disorders are caused by problems when air passes from the lungs, through the vocal cords, and then through the throat, nose, mouth, and lips. A voice disorder may be due to:; Genetic abnormalities; Emotional stress; Any trauma to the brain or infection; Problems or changes in the structure or shape of the muscles and bones used to make speech sounds.

A very severe and usually deadly form of necrotizing soft tissue infection is due to the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, which is sometimes called ""flesh-eating bacteria"" or strep.; Necrotizing soft tissue infection develops when the bacteria enters the body, usually through a minor cut or scrape. The bacteria begin to grow and release harmful substances (toxins) that kill tissue and affect blood flow to the area. With flesh-eating strep, the bacteria also make chemicals that block the body's ability to respond to the organism. As the tissue dies, the bacteria enters the blood and rapidly spreads throughout the body."

This means you must have 2 copies of an abnormal gene in order for the disease or trait to develop. The disorder is inherited from both your mother and father at the same time. The abnormal gene is rare, so the chances of both parents having the gene are very rare. For this reason, it is unlikely for somebody with the condition to pass it on to the next generation, although it is possible.; UV light, such as from sunlight, damages the genetic material (DNA) in skin cells. Normally, the body repairs this damage. But in people with XP, the body does not fix the damage. As a result, the skin gets very thin and patches of varying color (splotchy pigmentation) appear."

001469,Ectodermal dysplasias,Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia; Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome; Anondontia; Incontinentia pigmenti,"People with ectodermal dysplasia have a lack of sweat glands. This means they may not sweat or sweat less than normal.; In children with the disease, their bodies may have a problem controlling fevers. When the skin cannot sweat, it is hard for the body to control temperature properly. So even a mild illness can cause a very high fever.; Adults with the disease can't tolerate a warm environment. Air conditioning and other measures are needed to keep a normal body temperature.; Depending on which genes are affected, other symptoms may include:; Abnormal nails; Abnormal or missing teeth, or fewer than normal number of teeth; Cleft lip; Decreased skin color (pigment); Large forehead; Low nasal bridge; Thin, sparse hair; Learning disabilities; Poor hearing; Poor vision with decreased tear production; Weakened immune system",There are many different types of ectodermal dysplasias.

001473,Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines,Multiple lentigines syndrome; LEOPARD syndrome; NSML,"The former name of NSML of LEOPARD stands for the different problems (signs and symptoms) of this disorder:; NSML is similar to Noonan syndrome. However, the main symptom that tells apart the two conditions is that people with NSML have lentigines.; Lentigines -- large number of brown or black freckle-like skin markings that mainly affect the neck and upper chest but can appear all over the body; Electrocardiograph conduction abnormalities -- problems with the electrical and pumping functions of the heart; Ocular hypertelorism -- eyes that are spaced wide apart; Pulmonary valve stenosis -- narrowing of the pulmonary heart valve, resulting in less blood flow to the lungs and causing shortness of breath; Abnormalities of the genitals -- such as undescended testicles; Retardation of growth (delayed growth) -- including bone growth problems of the chest and spine; Deafness -- hearing loss may vary between mild and severe",NSML is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. This means the person only needs an abnormal gene from one parent in order to inherit the disorder.
001474,Boils,Furuncle,"A boil may begin as tender, pinkish-red, and swollen, on a firm area of the skin. Over time, it will feel like a water-filled balloon or cyst.; Pain gets worse as it fills with pus and dead tissue. Pain lessens when the boil drains. A boil may drain on its own. More often, the boil needs to be opened to drain.; The main symptoms of a boil include:; Other symptoms may include:; A bump about the size of a pea, but may be as large as a golf ball; White or yellow center (pustules); Spread to other skin areas or joining with other boils; Quick growth; Weeping, oozing, or crusting; Fatigue; Fever; General ill-feeling; Itching before the boil develops; Skin redness around the boil","Boils are very common. They are most often caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. They can also be caused by other types of bacteria or fungi found on the skin's surface. Damage to the hair follicle allows the infection to grow deeper into the follicle and the tissues under it.; Boils may occur in the hair follicles anywhere on the body. They are most common on the face, neck, armpit, buttocks, and thighs. You may have one or many boils. The condition may occur only once or it can be a long-lasting (chronic) or recurring problem."

They may include:; Severe, persistent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy; Salivating a lot more than normal; Weight loss; Signs of dehydration, such as dark urine, dry skin, weakness, lightheadedness, or fainting; Constipation; Inability to take in adequate amounts of fluid or nutrition","Most women have some nausea or vomiting (morning sickness), particularly during the first 3 months of pregnancy. The exact cause of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is not known. However, it is believed to be caused by a rapidly rising blood level of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). HCG is released by the placenta. Mild morning sickness is common. Hyperemesis gravidarum is less common and more severe.; Women with hyperemesis gravidarum have extreme nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. It can cause a weight loss of more than 5% of body weight. The condition can happen in any pregnancy, but is a little more likely if you are pregnant with twins (or more babies), or if you have a hydatidiform mole.

This measurement is called the uterine fundal height.,"Many different things can lead to IUGR. An unborn baby may not get enough oxygen and nutrition from the placenta during pregnancy because of:; Problems at birth (congenital abnormalities)Â or chromosome problems are often associated with below-normal weight. Infections during pregnancy can also affect the weight of the developing baby. These include:; Risk factors in the mother that may contribute to IUGR include:; If the mother is small, it may be normal for her baby to be small, and this is not due to IUGR.; Depending on the cause of IUGR, the developing baby may be small all over.

It can last up to 24 to 48 hours.; Feels like a sharp, cramping pain unlike other pain.; Is severe (rare).; May switch sides from month to month.; Begins midway through the menstrual cycle.","One in five women have pain around the time of ovulation. This is called mittelschmerz. The pain may occur just before, during, or after ovulation.; This pain can be explained in several ways. Just before the ovulation, the growth of the follicle where the egg develops may stretch the surface of the ovary. This can cause pain. At the time of ovulation, fluid or blood is released from the ruptured egg follicle. This may irritate the lining of the abdomen."
001504,Ovarian cysts,Physiologic ovarian cysts; Functional ovarian cysts; Corpus luteum cysts; Follicular cysts,"Ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms.; An ovarian cyst is more likely to cause pain if it:; Symptoms of ovarian cysts can also include:; Changes in menstrual periods are not common with follicular cysts.

The follicle is where an egg is developing.; Another type of cyst occurs after an egg has been released from a follicle. This is called a corpus luteum cyst. This type of cyst may contain a small amount of blood. This cyst makes progesterone and estrogen hormones.; Ovarian cysts are more common in the childbearing years between puberty and menopause. The condition is less common after menopause.; Taking fertility medicines often causes the development of multiple follicles (cysts) in the ovaries. These cysts most often go away after a woman's period, or after a pregnancy.; Functional ovarian cysts are not the same as ovarian tumors or cysts due to hormone-related conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.; The follicle makes the estrogen hormone.

They recognize their parents as familiar and safe. When separated from their parents, they feel threatened and unsafe.; Separation anxiety is a normal stage as a child grows and develops. It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master the world around them.; It usually ends when the child is around 2 years old. At this age, toddlers begin to understand that parents may be out of sight now, but will return later. It's also normal for them to test their independence.; To get over separation anxiety, children need to:; Even after children have mastered this stage, separation anxiety may return in times of stress. Most children will feel some degree of separation anxiety when in unfamiliar situations, most often when separated from their parents.; When children are in situations (such as hospitals) and are under stress (such as illness or pain), they seek the safety, comfort, and protection of their parents. Since anxiety can worsen pain, staying with a child as much as possible can reduce the pain.; Feel safe in their home.; Trust people other than their parents.; Trust that their parents will return."

The cause, or causes, are unknown. Most experts believe that children with the condition inherit a tendency to be anxious and inhibited. Most children with selective mutism have some form of extreme social fear (phobia).; Parents often think that the child is choosing not to speak. However in most cases, the child is truly unable to speak in certain settings.; Some affected children have a family history of selective mutism, extreme shyness, or anxiety disorders, which may increase their risk for similar problems.; This syndrome is not the same as mutism.

The developing brain and spine at this point are called the neural tube. The term ""NTD"" refers to any birth defect in which the neural tube in the area of the spine fails to close completely.; Myelomeningocele is an NTD in which the bones of the spine do not completely form. This results in an incomplete spinal canal. The spinal cord and meninges protrude from the child's back.; This condition may affect as many as 1 out of every 4,000 infants.; Other types of NTDs include:; A child with myelomeningocele may also have other disorders or birth defects. Eight out of ten children with this condition have hydrocephalus, or an abnormal buildup of spinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain.; Other disorders of the spinal cord or musculoskeletal system may be seen with myelomeningocele, including:; The cause of NTDs is not known. However, low levels of folic acid in a woman's body before and during early pregnancy appear to play a part in this type of birth defect. Folic acid (or folate) is important for development of brain and spinal cord.; If a child is born with myelomeningocele, future children in that family have a higher risk than the general population. However, in many cases, there is no family connection. Factors such as diabetes, obesity, and the use of anti-seizure and other medicines known to lower folic acid levels in the mother may increase the risk of this defect.; Spina bifida occulta, a condition in which the bones of the spine do not close.

The placenta is the organ that grows during pregnancy to feed the baby. After birth, the baby's liver starts doing this job. But, it may take some time for the baby's liver to be able to do this efficiently.; Most newborns have some yellowing of the skin, or jaundice. This is called physiological jaundice. It is usually noticeable when the baby is 2 to 4 days old. Most of the time, it does not cause problems and goes away within 2 weeks.; Two types of jaundice may occur in newborns who are breastfed. Both types are usually harmless.; Severe newborn jaundice may occur if the baby has a condition that increases the number of red blood cells that need to be replaced in the body, such as:; Things that make it harder for the baby's body to remove bilirubin may also lead to more severe jaundice, including:; Babies who are born too early (premature) are more likely to develop jaundice than full-term babies.; Breastfeeding jaundice is seen in breastfed babies during the first week of life. It is more likely to occur when babies do not nurse well or the mother's milk is slow to come, leading to dehydration.; Breast milk jaundice may appear in some healthy, breastfed babies after day 7 of life. It is likely to peak during weeks 2 and 3, but may last at low levels for a month or more. The problem may be due to how substances in the breast milk affect the breakdown of bilirubin in the liver. Breast milk jaundice is different from breastfeeding jaundice.; Abnormal blood cell shapes (such as sickle cell anemia); Blood type mismatch between the mother and baby (Rh incompatibility or ABO incompatibility); Bleeding underneath the scalp (cephalohematoma) caused by a difficult delivery; Higher levels of red blood cells, which is more common in small-for-gestational age (SGA) babies and some twins; Infection; Lack of certain important proteins, called enzymes; Certain medicines; Infections present at birth, such as rubella, syphilis, and others; Diseases that affect the liver or biliary tract, such as cystic fibrosis or hepatitis; Low blood oxygen level (hypoxia); Infections (sepsis); Many different genetic or inherited disorders"

This substance helps the lungs fill with air and keeps the air sacs from deflating. Surfactant is present when the lungs are fully developed.; Neonatal RDS can also be due to genetic problems with lung development.; Most cases of RDS occur in babies born before 37 to 39 weeks. The more premature the baby is, the higher the chance of RDS after birth. The problem is uncommon in babies born full-term or later (39 weeks or after).; Other factors that can increase the risk for RDS include:; A brother or sister who had RDS; Diabetes in the mother; Cesarean delivery or induction of labor before the baby is full-term; Problems with delivery that reduce blood flow to the baby; Multiple pregnancy (twins or more); Rapid labor"

It is not associated with any one common genetic abnormality. It rarely occurs in other family members.; TGA is a cyanotic heart defect. This means there is decreased oxygen in the blood that is pumped from the heart to the rest of the body.; In normal hearts, blood that returns from the body goes through the right side of the heart and pulmonary artery to the lungs to get oxygen. The blood then comes back to the left side of the heart and travels out the aorta to the body.; In TGA, venous blood returns normally to the heart through the right atrium. But, instead of going to the lungs to absorb oxygen, this blood is pumped out through the aorta and back to the body. This blood has not been recharged with oxygen and leads to cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes.; Symptoms appear at birth or very soon afterward. How bad the symptoms are depends on the type and size of additional heart defects (such as atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus) and how much the blood can mix between the two abnormal circulations."
001569,Measles,Rubeola,"Symptoms of measles usually begin 10 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. This is called the incubation period.; Rash is often the main symptom. The rash:; Other symptoms may include:; Usually appears 3 to 5 days after the first signs of being sick; May last 4 to 7 days; Usually starts on the head and spreads to other areas, moving down the body; May appear as flat, discolored areas (macules) and solid, red, raised areas (papules) that later join together; Itches; Bloodshot eyes; Cough; Fever; Light sensitivity (photophobia); Muscle pain; Red and inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis); Runny nose; Sore throat; Tiny white spots inside the mouth (Koplik spots)","Measles is spread by contact with droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of an infected person. Sneezing and coughing can put contaminated droplets into the air.; If one person has the measles, 90% of the people who come in contact with that person will get the measles, unless they have been vaccinated.; People who had measles or who have been vaccinated against measles are protected from the disease. As of 2000, measles had been eliminated in the United States. However, unvaccinated people who travel to other countries where measles is common have brought the disease back to the United States. This has led to recent outbreaks of measles in groups of people who are unvaccinated.; Some parents do not let their children get vaccinated. This is because of unfounded fears that the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, can cause autism. Parents and caregivers should know that:; Large studies of thousands of children have found no connection between this or any vaccine and autism.; Reviews by all major health organizations in the United States, Great Britain, and elsewhere all found NO LINK between the MMR vaccine and autism.; The study that had first reported a risk of autism from this vaccine has been proven to be fraudulent."
001570,Encopresis,Soiling; Incontinence - stool; Constipation - encopresis; Impaction - encopresis,Symptoms can include any of the following:; Being unable to hold stool before getting to a toilet (bowel incontinence); Passing stool in inappropriate places (as in the child's clothes); Keeping bowel movements a secret; Having constipation and hard stools; Passing a very large stool sometimes that almost blocks the toilet; Loss of appetite; Urine retention; Refusal to sit on toilet; Refusal to take medicines; Bloating sensation or pain in the abdomen,"The child may haveÂ constipation. The stool is hard, dry, and stuck in the colon (called fecal impaction). The child then passes only wet or almost liquid stool that flows around the hard stool. It may leak out during the day or night.; Other causes may include:; Whatever the cause, the child may feel shame, guilt, or low self-esteem, and may hide signs of encopresis.; Factors that may increase the risk of encopresis include:; Encopresis is much more common in boys than in girls. It tends to go away as the child gets older.; Not toilet training the child; StartingÂ toilet training when the child was too young; Emotional problems, such as oppositional defiant disorderÂ or conduct disorder; Chronic constipation; Low socioeconomic status"
001571,Hydrocephalus,Water on the brain,"Symptoms of hydrocephalus depend on:; In infants, hydrocephalus causes the fontanelle (soft spot) to bulge and the head to be larger than expected. Early symptoms may also include:; Symptoms that may occur in older children can include:; Age; Amount of brain damage; What is causing the buildup of CSF fluid; Eyes that appear to gaze downward; Irritability; Seizures; Separated sutures; Sleepiness; Vomiting; Brief, shrill, high-pitched cry; Changes in personality, memory, or the ability to reason or think; Changes in facial appearance and eye spacing; Crossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movements; Difficulty feeding; Excessive sleepiness; Headache; Irritability, poor temper control; Loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence); Loss of coordination and trouble walking; Muscle spasticity (spasm); Slow growth (child 0 to 5 years); Slow or restricted movement; Vomiting","Hydrocephalus is due to a problem with the flow of the fluid that surrounds the brain. This fluid is called the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. The fluid surrounds the brain and spinal cord and helps cushion the brain.; CSF normally moves through the brain and around the spinal cord, and then is absorbed into the bloodstream. CSF levels in the brain can rise if:; Too much CSF puts pressure on the brain. This pushes the brain up against the skull and damages brain tissue.; Hydrocephalus may begin while the baby is growing in the womb. It is common in babies who have a myelomeningocele, a birth defect in which the spinal column does not close properly.; Hydrocephalus may also be due to:; In young children, hydrocephalus may be due to:; Hydrocephalus most often occurs in children. Another type, called normal pressure hydrocephalus, may occur in adults and older people.; The flow of CSF is blocked.; The fluid does not get properly absorbed into the blood.; The brain makes too much of the fluid.; Genetic defects; Certain infections during pregnancy; Infections that affect the central nervous system (such as meningitis or encephalitis), especially in infants.; Bleeding in the brain during or soon after delivery (especially in premature babies).; Injury before, during, or after childbirth, including subarachnoid hemorrhage.; Tumors of the central nervous system, including the brain or spinal cord.; Injury or trauma."
001572,Juvenile angiofibroma,Nasal tumor; Angiofibroma - juvenile; Benign nasal tumor; Juvenile nasal angiofibroma; JNA,"Symptoms include:; Difficulty breathing through the nose; Easy bruising; Frequent or repeated nosebleeds; Headache; Swelling of the cheek; Hearing loss; Nasal discharge, usually bloody; Prolonged bleeding; Stuffy nose",Juvenile angiofibroma is not very common. It is most often found in adolescent boys. The tumor contains many blood vessels andÂ spreads within the area in which it started (locally invasive). This can cause bone damage.
001573,Osteogenesis imperfecta,Brittle bone disease; Congenital disease; OI,"All people with OI have weak bones, and fractures are more likely. People with OI are most often below average height (short stature). However, the severity of the disease varies greatly.; The classic symptoms include:; Because type I collagen is also found in ligaments, people with OI often have loose joints (hypermobility) and flat feet. Some types of OI also lead to the development of poor teeth.; Symptoms of more severe forms of OI may include:; Blue tint to the whites of their eyes (blue sclera); Multiple bone fractures; Early hearing loss (deafness); Bowed legs and arms; Kyphosis; Scoliosis (S-curve spine)","Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is present at birth. It is often caused by a defect in the gene that produces type I collagen, an important building block of bone. There are many defects that can affect this gene. The severity of OI depends on the specific gene defect.; If you have one copy of the gene, you will have the disease. Most cases of OI are inherited from a parent. However, some cases are the result of new genetic mutations.; A person with OI has a 50% chance of passing on the gene and the disease to their children."
001574,Rubella,Three day measles; German measles,"Children generally have few symptoms. Adults may have a fever, headache, general discomfort (malaise), and a runny nose before the rash appears. They may not notice the symptoms.; Other symptoms may include:; Bruising (rare); Inflammation of the eyes (bloodshot eyes); Muscle or joint pain","Rubella is caused by a virus that is spread through the air or by close contact.; A person with rubella may spread the disease to others from 1 week before the rash begins, until 1 to 2 weeks after the rash disappears.; Because the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is given to most children, rubella is much less common now. Almost everyone who receives the vaccine has immunity to rubella. Immunity means that your body has built a defense to the rubella virus.; In some adults, the vaccine may wear off. This means they are not fully protected. Women who may become pregnant and other adults may receive a booster shot.; Children and adults who were never vaccinated against rubella may also get this infection."
001575,Wilms tumor,Nephroblastoma; Kidney tumor - Wilms,Symptoms may include any of the following:; Abdominal pain; Abnormal urine color; Constipation; Fever; General discomfort or uneasiness (malaise); High blood pressure; Increased growth on only one side of the body; Loss of appetite; Nausea and vomiting; Swelling in the abdomen (abdominal hernia or mass); Sweating (at night); Blood in urine (hematuria),"WT is the most common form of childhood kidney cancer. The exact cause of this tumor is unknown in most children.; A missing iris of the eye (aniridia) is a birth defect that is sometimes associated with WT. Other birth defects linked to this type of kidney cancer include certain urinary tract problems and enlargement of one side of the body, a condition called hemihypertrophy.; It is more common among some siblings and twins, which suggests a possible genetic cause.; The disease occurs most often in children about 3 years old. More than 90% of cases are diagnosed before 10 years of age. In rare cases, it is seen in children older than 15 years of age, and in adults."
001576,Congenital nephrotic syndrome,Nephrotic syndrome - congenital,Symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include:; Cough; Decreased urine output; Foamy appearance of urine; Low birth weight; Poor appetite; Swelling (total body),"Congenital nephrotic syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means that each parent must pass on a copy of the defective gene in order for the child to have the disease.; Although congenital means present from birth, with congenital nephrotic syndrome, symptoms of the disease occur in the first 3 months of life.; Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a very rare form of nephrotic syndrome.; Nephrotic syndrome is defined by a set of abnormal findings that include:; Children with this disorder have an abnormal form of a protein called nephrin. The kidney's filters (glomeruli) need this protein to function normally.; Protein in the urine; Low blood protein levels in the blood; High cholesterol levels; High triglyceride levels; Swelling"
001577,Achondroplasia,Dwarf; Dwarfism; Achondroplastic dwarfism,Achondroplastic dwarfism results in the following:; Almost all people with achondroplasia have normal intelligence and will have a normal lifespan. Children with the disorder may develop at a slower rate than other children the same age.; Unusually large head; Large forehead and flat bridge of the nose; Crowded or crooked teeth; Short stature (well below the average height for a person of the same age and sex); Average size trunk with short arms and legs (especially the upper arms and thighs); Bowed legs; Limited range of motion of the elbows; Spine curvatures called kyphosis and lordosis; Short fingers with an extra space between the ring and middle finger (trident hand); Decreased muscle tone in infants,"Achondroplasia is one of a group of conditions called chondrodystrophies or osteochondrodysplasias. These rare genetic disorders cause problems with the development of bone, cartilage, and connective tissue.; Achondroplasia is caused by a change (mutation) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This prevents bone growth and mainly affects the long bones in the arms and legs. People with achondroplasia have a short stature, with an average height under 4 feet 6 inches (137 centimeters).; Achondroplasia may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that if a child gets the defective gene from one parent, the child will have the disorder. If one parent has achondroplasia, the infant has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder. If both parents have the condition, the infant's chance of being affected increases to 75%.; However, most cases (about 80%) appear as spontaneous mutations. This means that two parents without achondroplasia may give birth to a baby with the condition."
001578,Amelogenesis imperfecta,AI; Congenital enamel hypoplasia,The enamel of the tooth is soft and thin. The teeth appear yellow and are easily damaged. Both baby teeth and permanent teeth can be affected.,Amelogenesis imperfecta is passed down through families as a dominant trait. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order to get the disease.
001579,Amniotic band sequence,Amniotic band syndrome; Amniotic constriction bands; Constriction band syndrome; ABS; Limb-body wall complex; Constriction rings; Body wall defect,"The severity of the deformity can vary widely, from a small dent in a toe or finger to an entire body part missing or being severely underdeveloped. Symptoms may include:; Abnormal gap in the head or face (if it goes across the face, it is called a cleft); All or part of a finger, toe, arm or leg missing (congenital amputation); Defect (cleft or hole) of the abdomen or chest wall (if band is located in those areas); Permanent band or indentation around an arm, leg, finger, or toe","Amniotic bands are thought to be caused by damage to a part of the placenta called the amnion (or amniotic membrane). The placenta carries blood to a baby still growing in the womb. Damage to the placenta can prevent normal growth and development.; Damage to the amnion may produce fiber-like bands that can trap, compress, or amputate parts of the developing baby. These bands reduce blood supply to the areas and cause them to develop abnormally.; However, some cases of ABS deformity may be caused by reduced blood supply without any signs of bands or damage to the amnion. There have also been rare cases that seem to be due to genetic defects."
001580,Anencephaly,Aprosencephaly with open cranium,Symptoms of anencephaly are:; Heart defects may be present in 1 out of 5 cases.; Absence of the skull; Absence of parts of the brain; Facial feature abnormalities; Severe developmental delay,Anencephaly is one of the most common neural tube defects. Neural tube defects are birth defects that affect the tissue that becomes the spinal cord and brain.; Anencephaly occurs early in the development of an unborn baby. It results when the upper part of the neural tube fails to close. The exact cause is not known. Possible causes include:; The exact number of cases of anencephaly is unknown. Many of these pregnancies result in miscarriage. Having one infant with this condition increases the risk of having another child with neural tube defects.; Environmental toxins; Low intake of folic acid by the mother during pregnancy
001581,Apert syndrome,Acrocephalosyndactyly,"Symptoms include:; Several other syndromes can lead to a similar appearance of the face and head, but do not include the severe hand and foot features of Apert syndrome. These similar syndromes include:; Early closure of sutures between bones of the skull, noted by ridging along sutures (craniosynostosis); Frequent ear infections; Fusion or severe webbing of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fingers, often called ""mitten hands""; Hearing loss; Large or late-closing soft spot on a baby's skull (fontanelle); Possible, slow intellectual development (varies from person to person); Prominent or bulging eyes; Severe under-development of the midface; Skeletal (limb) abnormalities; Short height; Webbing or fusion of the toes; Carpenter syndrome (kleeblattschadel, cloverleaf skull deformity); Crouzon disease (craniofacial dysostosis); Pfeiffer syndrome; Saethre-Chotzen syndrome",Apert syndrome can be passed down through families (inherited) as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that only one parent needs to pass on the altered gene to a child to have the condition.; Most cases may occur without a known family history.; Apert syndrome is caused by one of two changes to the FGFR2 gene. This gene change causes some of the bony sutures of the skull to close too early. This condition is called craniosynostosis.
001582,Bezoar,Trichobezoar; Hairball,Symptoms may include:; Indigestion; Stomach upset or distress; Nausea and vomiting; Diarrhea; Pain; Gastric ulcers,"Chewing on or eating hair or fuzzy materials (or indigestible materials such as plastic bags) can lead to the formation of a bezoar. The rate is very low. The risk is greater among people with intellectual disability or emotionally disturbed children. Generally, bezoars are mostly seen in females aged 10 to 19 years."
001583,Incontinentia pigmenti,Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome; Bloch-Siemens syndrome,"With the skin symptoms, there are 4 stages. Infants with IP are born with streaky, blistering areas. In stage 2, when the areas heal, they turn into rough bumps. In stage 3, the bumps go away, but leave behind darkened skin, called hyperpigmentation. After several years, the skin returns to normal. In stage 4, there may be areas of lighter-colored skin (hypopigmentation) that are thinner.; IP is associated with central nervous system problems, including:; People with IP may also have abnormal teeth, hair loss, and vision problems.; Delayed development; Loss of movement (paralysis); Intellectual disability; Muscle spasms; Seizures","IP is caused by an X-linked dominant genetic defect that occurs on a gene known as IKBKG.; Because the gene defect occurs on the X chromosome, the condition is most often seen in females. When it occurs in males, it is usually lethal in the fetus and results in miscarriage."
001584,Blount disease,Blount's disease; Tibia vara,"One or both of the lower legs turn inward. This is called ""bowing."" It may:; Look the same on both legs; Occur just below the knee; Rapidly get worse","Blount disease occurs in young children and adolescents. The cause is unknown. It is thought to be due to the effects of weight on the growth plate. The inner part of the shin bone, just below the knee, fails to develop normally.; Unlike bowlegs, which tend to straighten as the child develops, Blount disease slowly gets worse. It can cause severe bowing of one or both legs.; This condition is more common among African American children. It is also associated with obesity and early walking."
001585,Bowlegs,Genu varum,Symptoms may include:; Knees thatÂ do notÂ touch when standing with feet together (ankles touching); Bowing of legs is same on both sides of the body (symmetrical); Bowed legs continue beyond age 3,"Infants are born bowlegged because of their folded position in the mother's womb. Bowed legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk and the legs begin to bear weight (about 12 to 18 months old).; By around age 3, the child can most often stand with the ankles apart and the knees just touching. If the bowed legs are still present, the child is called bowlegged.; Bowlegs may be caused by illnesses, such as:; Abnormal bone development; Blount disease; Fractures thatÂ do notÂ heal correctly; Lead or fluoride poisoning; Rickets, which is caused by a lack of vitamin D"
001586,Canavan disease,Spongy degeneration of the brain; Aspartoacylase deficiency; Canavan - van Bogaert disease,"Symptoms often begin in the first year of life. Parents tend to notice it when their child is not reaching certain developmental milestones, including head control.; Symptoms include:; Abnormal posture with flexed arms and straight legs; Food material flows back into the nose; Feeding problems; Increasing head size; Irritability; Poor muscle tone, especially of the neck muscles; A lack of head control when baby is pulled from a lying to a sitting position; Poor visual tracking, or blindness; Reflux (gastrointestinal) with vomiting; Seizures; Severe intellectual disability; Swallowing difficulties","Canavan disease is passed down (inherited) through families. It is more common among the Ashkenazi Jewish population than in the general population.; The lack of the enzyme aspartoacylase leads to a buildup of material called N-acetylaspartic acid in the brain. This causes the white matter of the brain to break down.; There are two forms of the disease:; Neonatal (infantile) -- This is the most common form. Symptoms are severe. Babies seem to be normal the first few months after birth. By 3 to 5 months, they have developmental problems, such as those mentioned below under the Symptoms section of this article.; Juvenile -- This is a less common form. Symptoms are mild. Developmental problems are less severe than those of the neonatal form. In some cases, the symptoms are so mild that they go undiagnosed as Canavan disease."
001587,Caput succedaneum,Caput,"Symptoms may include:; Soft, puffy swelling on the scalp of a newborn infant; Possible bruising or color change on the scalp swelling area; Swelling that may extend to both sides of the scalp; Swelling that is most often seen on the portion of the head which presented first","A caput succedaneum is more likely to form during a long or hard delivery. It is more common after the membranes have broken. This is because the fluid in the amniotic sac is no longer providing a cushion for the baby's head. Vacuum extraction done during a difficult birth can also increase the chances of a caput succedaneum.; A caput succedaneum may be detected by prenatal ultrasound, even before labor or delivery begins. It has been found as early as 31 weeks of pregnancy. Very often, this is due to an early rupture of the membranes or too little amniotic fluid. It is less likely that a caput will form if the membranes stay intact."
001588,Fractured clavicle in the newborn,Fractured collar bone - newborn; Broken collar bone - newborn,"The baby will not move the painful, injured arm. Instead, the baby will hold it still against the side of the body. Lifting the baby under the arms causes the child pain. Sometimes, the fracture can be felt with the fingers, but the problem often can't be seen or felt.; Within a few weeks, a hard lump may develop where the bone is healing. This lump may be the only sign that the newborn had a broken collar bone.",A fracture of a newborn's collar bone (clavicle) can occur during a difficult vaginal delivery.
001589,Cleidocranial dysostosis,Cleidocranial dysplasia; Dento-osseous dysplasia; Marie-Sainton syndrome; CLCD; Dysplasia cleidocranial; Osteodental dysplasia,"People with cleidocranial dysostosis have a jaw and brow area that sticks out. The middle of their nose (nasal bridge) is wide.; The collar bones may be missing or abnormally developed. This pushes the shoulders together in front of the body.; Primary teeth do not fall out at the expected time. Adult teeth may develop later than normal and an extra set of adult teeth grow in. This causes the teeth to become crooked.; Intelligence level is most often normal.; Other symptoms include:; Ability to touch shoulders together in front of body; Delayed closure of fontanelles (""soft spots""); Loose joints; Prominent forehead (frontal bossing); Short forearms; Short fingers; Short stature; Increased risk of getting flat foot, abnormal curvature of spine (scoliosis) and knee deformities; High risk of hearing loss due to infections; Increased risk of fracture due to decreased bone density","Cleidocranial dysostosis is caused by an abnormal gene. It is passed down through families as an autosomal dominant trait. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order for you to inherit the disease.; Cleidocranial dysostosis is a congenital condition, which means it is present from before birth. The condition affects girls and boys equally."
001590,Craniosynostosis,Premature closure of sutures; Synostosis; Plagiocephaly; Scaphocephaly; Fontanelle - craniosynostosis; Soft spot - craniosynostosis,"Symptoms depend on the type of craniosynostosis. They may include:; Types of craniosynostosis are:; No ""soft spot"" (fontanelle) on the newborn's skull; A raised hard ridge along the affected sutures; Unusual head shape; Slow or no increase in the head size over time as the baby grows; Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly) is the most common type. It affects the main suture on the very top of the head. The early closing forces the head to grow long and narrow, instead of wide. Babies with this type tend to have a broad forehead. It is more common in boys than girls.; Frontal plagiocephaly is the next most common type. It affects the suture that runs from ear to ear on the top of the head. It usually occurs on just one side, causing a flattened forehead, raised eyebrow, and prominent ear on that side. The baby's nose may also appear to be pulled toward that side. This is more common in girls than in boys.; Metopic synostosis is a rare form that affects the suture close to the forehead. The child's head shape may be described as trigonocephaly, because the top of the head appears triangular, with a narrow or pointed forehead. It may range from mild to severe.","The cause of craniosynostosis is not known. Genes may play a role, but there is usually no family history of the condition. It may be caused by external pressure on a baby's head before birth. Abnormal development of the base of the skull and the membranes around the skull bones is believed to affect the movement and position of the bones as they grow.; In cases when this is passed down through families, it may occur with other health problems, such as seizures, decreased intelligence, and blindness. Genetic disorders commonly linked to craniosynostosis include Crouzon, Apert, Carpenter, Saethre-Chotzen, and Pfeiffer syndromes.; However, most children with craniosynostosis are otherwise healthy and have normal intelligence."
001591,Craniotabes,Congenital cranial osteoporosis,"Symptoms include:; Soft areas of the skull, especially along the suture line; Soft areas pop in and out; Bones may feel soft, flexible, and thin along the suture lines","Craniotabes can be a normal finding in infants, particularly premature infants. It may occur in up to one third of all newborn infants.; Craniotabes is harmless in the newborn, unless it is associated with other problems. These can include rickets and osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bones)."
001592,Chickenpox,Varicella; Chicken pox,"Most children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears:; The chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. In most cases, a child will develop 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin.; Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria that is made more likely by scratching.; Some children who have had the vaccine will still develop a mild case of chickenpox. In most cases, they recover much more quickly and have only a few poxes (fewer than 30). These cases are often harder to diagnose. However, these children can still spread chickenpox to others.; Fever; Headache; Stomach ache; The blisters are most often first seen on the face, middle of the body, or scalp.; After a day or two, the blisters become cloudy and then scab. Meanwhile, new blisters form in groups. They often appear in the mouth, in the vagina, and on the eyelids.; Children with skin problems, such as eczema, may get thousands of blisters.","Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes shingles in adults.; Chickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox:; Most cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.; Children whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox.; Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.; From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister; If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you"
001593,Cri du chat syndrome,Chromosome 5p deletion syndrome; 5p minus syndrome; Cat cry syndrome,"Symptoms include:; Cry that is high-pitched and may sound like a cat; Downward slant to the eyes; Epicanthal folds, an extra fold of skin over the inner corner of the eye; Low birth weight and slow growth; Low-set or abnormally shaped ears; Hearing loss; Heart defects; Intellectual disability; Partial webbing or fusing of fingers or toes; Curvature of the spine (scoliosis); Single line in the palm of the hand; Skin tags just in front of the ear; Slow or incomplete development of motor skills; Small head (microcephaly); Small jaw (micrognathia); Wide-set eyes","Cri du chat syndrome is rare. It is caused by a missing piece of chromosome 5.; Most cases are believed to occur during the development of the egg or sperm. A small number of cases occur when a parent passes a different, rearranged form of the chromosome to their child."
001594,Hypervitaminosis D,Vitamin D toxicity,"An excess of vitamin D can cause an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). This can severely damage the kidneys, soft tissues, and bones over time.; The symptoms include:; Constipation; Decreased appetite (anorexia); Dehydration; Fatigue and confusion; Frequent urination; Irritability; Muscle weakness; Vomiting; Excessive thirst (polydipsia); High blood pressure; Passing large amounts of urine (polyuria)","The cause is excess intake of vitamin D. The doses need to be very high, far above what most health care providers normally prescribe.; There has been a lot of confusion about vitamin D supplementation. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is between 400 and 800 IU/day, according to age and pregnancy status. Higher doses may be needed for some people, such as those with vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and other conditions. However, most people do not need more than 2,000 IU of vitamin D a day.; For most people, vitamin D toxicity only occurs with vitamin D doses above 10,000 IU per day."
001595,Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome,TTTS; Fetal transfusion syndrome,"Most of the time, the donor twin is smaller than the other twin at birth. The infant often has anemia, is dehydrated, and looks pale.; The recipient twin is born larger, with redness to the skin, too much blood, and a higher blood pressure. The twin that gets too much blood may develop cardiac failure because of the high blood volume. The infant may also need medicine to strengthen heart function.; The unequal size of identical twins is referred to as discordant twins.","Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) occurs when the blood supply of one twin moves to the other through the shared placenta. The twin that loses the blood is called the donor twin. The twin that receives the blood is called the recipient twin.; Both infants may have problems, depending on how much blood is passed from one to the other. The donor twin may have too little blood, and the other may have too much blood."
001596,Meconium aspiration syndrome,MAS; Meconium pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs); Labor - meconium; Delivery - meconium; Neonatal - meconium; Newborn care - meconium,"Most babies who have passed meconium into the amniotic fluid do not breathe it into their lungs during labor and delivery. They are unlikely to have any symptoms or problems.; Babies who do breathe in this fluid may have the following:; Bluish skin color (cyanosis) in the infant; Working hard to breathe (noisy breathing, grunting, using extra muscles to breathe, breathing rapidly); No breathing (lack of respiratory effort, or apnea); Limpness at birth","Meconium is the early stool passed by a newborn soon after birth, before the baby starts to feed and digest milk or formula.; In some cases, the baby passes meconium while still inside the uterus. This can happen when babies are ""under stress""Â due to a decrease in blood and oxygen supply. This is often due to problems with the placenta or the umbilical cord.; Once the baby passes the meconium into the surrounding amniotic fluid, they may breathe it into the lungs. This may happen:; The meconium can also block the infant's airways right after birth. It can cause breathing problems due to disrupting the balance of proteins normally present as well as causing swelling (inflammation) in the baby's lungs after birth and disrupting the normal changes of blood flow between the heart and lungs following birth.; Risk factors that may cause stress on the baby before birth include:; While the baby is still in the uterus; During delivery; Immediately after birth; ""Aging"" of the placenta if the pregnancy goes far past the due date; Decreased oxygen to the infant while in the uterus; Diabetes in the pregnant mother; Difficult delivery or long labor; High blood pressure in the pregnant mother; Infection in the placenta affecting the baby"
001597,Infant of diabetic mother,IDM; Gestational diabetes - IDM; Neonatal care - diabetic mother,"The infant is often larger than usual for babies born after the same length of time in the mother's womb (large for gestational age). In some cases, especially if mothers have more longstanding illness, the baby may be smaller (small for gestational age).; Other symptoms may include:; Blue skin color, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing (signs of immature lungs or heart failure); Poor sucking, lethargy, weak cry; Seizures (sign of severe low blood sugar); Poor feeding; Puffy face; Tremors or shaking shortly after birth; Jaundice (yellow skin color)","There are two forms of diabetes during pregnancy:; If diabetes is not well controlled during pregnancy, the baby is exposed to high blood sugar levels. This can affect the baby and mother during pregnancy, at the time of birth, and after birth.; Infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) are often larger than other babies, especially if diabetes is not well-controlled. This may make vaginal birth harder and may increase the risk for nerve injuries and other trauma during birth. Also, cesarean births are more likely.; An IDM is more likely to have periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth, and during the first few days of life. This is because the baby has been used to getting more sugar than needed from the mother. They have a higher insulin level than needed after birth. Insulin lowers the blood sugar. It can take days for babies' insulin levels to adjust after birth.; IDMs are more likely to have:; If diabetes is not well-controlled, chances of miscarriage or stillbirthÂ are higher.; An IDM has a higher risk of birth defects if the mother has pre-existing diabetes that is not well controlled from the very beginning.; Gestational diabetes -- high blood sugar (diabetes) that starts or is first detected during pregnancy; Pre-existing or pre-gestational diabetes -- already having diabetes before becoming pregnant; Breathing difficulty due to less mature lungs; High red blood cell count (polycythemia); High bilirubin level (newborn jaundice); Thickening of the heart muscle between the large chambers (ventricles)"
001599,Meatal stenosis,Urethral meatal stenosis,Symptoms include:; Abnormal strength and direction of urine stream; Bed wetting; Bleeding (hematuria) at end of urination; Discomfort with urination or straining with urination; Incontinence (day or night); Visible narrowing of the urethral opening in boys,"Meatal stenosis can affect both males and females. It is more common in males.; In males, it is often caused by swelling and irritation (inflammation). In most cases, this problem occurs in newborns after circumcision. Abnormal scar tissue can grow across the opening of the urethra, causing it to narrow. The problem may not be detected until the child is toilet trained.; In adult men, the condition can result from surgery on the urethra, ongoing use of an indwelling catheter, or a procedure to treat an enlarged prostate gland (BPH).; In females, this condition is present at birth (congenital). Less commonly, meatal stenosis may also affect adult women.; Risks include:; Having many endoscopic procedures (cystoscopy); Severe, long-term atrophic vaginitis"
001600,Rh incompatibility,Rh-induced hemolytic disease of the newborn; Erythroblastosis fetalis,"Rh incompatibility can cause symptoms ranging from very mild to deadly. In its mildest form, Rh incompatibility causes the destruction of red blood cells. There are no other effects.; After birth, the infant may have:; Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice); Low muscle tone (hypotonia) and lethargy","During pregnancy, red blood cells from the unborn baby can cross into the mother's blood through the placenta.; If the mother is Rh-negative, her immune system treats Rh-positive fetal cells as if they were a foreign substance. The mother's body makes antibodies against the fetal blood cells. These antibodies may cross back through the placenta into the developing baby. They destroy the baby's circulating red blood cells.; When red blood cells are broken down, they make bilirubin. This causes an infant to become yellow (jaundiced). The level of bilirubin in the infant's blood may range from mild to dangerously high.; Firstborn infants are often not affected unless the mother had past miscarriages or abortions. This would sensitize her immune system. This is because it takes time for the mother to develop antibodies. All children she has later who are also Rh-positive may be affected.; Rh incompatibility develops only when the mother is Rh-negative and the infant is Rh-positive. This problem has become less common in places that provide good prenatal care. This is because special immune globulins called RhoGAM are routinely used."
001601,Metatarsus adductus,Metatarsus varus; Forefoot varus; In-toeing,The front of the foot is bent or angled in toward the middle of the foot. The back of the foot and the ankles are normal. About one half of children with metatarsus adductus have these changes in both feet.; (Club foot is a different problem. The foot is pointed down and the ankle is turned in.),"Metatarsus adductus is thought to be caused by the infant's position inside the womb. Risks may include:; There may also be a family history of the condition.; Metatarsus adductus is a fairly common problem. It is one of the reasons why people develop ""in-toeing.""; Newborns with metatarsus adductus may also have a problem called developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), which allows the thigh bone to slip out of the hip socket.; The baby's bottom was pointed down in the womb (breech position).; The mother had a condition called oligohydramnios, in which she did not produce enough amniotic fluid."
001602,Diastasis recti,,"A diastasis recti looks like a ridge, which runs down the middle of the belly area. It stretches from the bottom of the breastbone to the belly button. It increases with muscle straining.; In infants, the condition is most easily seen when the baby tries to sit up. When the infant is relaxed, you can often feel the edges of the rectus muscles.; Diastasis recti is commonly seen in women who have multiple pregnancies. This is because the muscles have been stretched many times. Extra skin and soft tissue in the front of the abdominal wall may be the only signs of this condition in early pregnancy. In the later part of pregnancy, the top of the pregnant uterus can be seen bulging out of the abdominal wall. An outline of parts of the unborn baby may be seen in some severe cases.",Diastasis recti is common in newborns. It is seen most often in premature and African American infants.; Pregnant women may develop the condition because of increased tension on the abdominal wall. The risk is higher with multiple births or many pregnancies.
001603,Epstein pearls,Gingival cysts of the newborn,The symptoms are whitish-yellow nodules that appear on the gums or the roof of the mouth. They sometimes look like emerging teeth.,Epstein pearls occur only in newborns and are very common. They are seen in about 4 out of 5 newborns.

It may occur during:; These events often lead to a lack of food, causing malnutrition.; Kwashiorkor is rare in children in the United States. There are only isolated cases. However, one government estimate suggests that as many as half of older age people living in nursing homes in the United States do not get enough protein in their diet.; When kwashiorkor does occur in the United States, it is most often a sign of child abuse and severe neglect.; Famine; Limited food supply; Low levels of education (when people do not understand how to eat a proper diet); Drought or other natural disaster; Political unrest"
001605,Prader-Willi syndrome,,"Signs of Prader-Willi syndrome may be seen at birth.; Other symptoms may include:; Children have an intense craving for food. They will do almost anything to get food, including hoarding. This can result in rapid weight gain and morbid obesity. Morbid obesity may lead to:; Newborns are often small and floppy with reduced muscle tone; Male infants may have undescended testicles; Trouble feeding as an infant, with poor weight gain; Almond-shaped eyes; Delayed muscle and motor function development; Narrowed head at the temples; Rapid weight gain; Short stature; Slow mental development; Very small hands and feet in comparison to the child's body; Type 2 diabetes; High blood pressure; Joint and lung problems","Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by a missing gene on chromosome 15. Normally, parents each pass down a copy of this chromosome. The syndrome can occur in a couple of ways:; These genetic changes occur randomly. People who have this syndrome usually do not have a family history of the condition.; The father's genes are missing on chromosome 15; There are variations with the father's genes on chromosome 15; There are two copies of the mother's chromosome 15 and none from the father"
001606,Neonatal conjunctivitis,Newborn conjunctivitis; Conjunctivitis of the newborn; Ophthalmia neonatorum; Eye infection - neonatal conjunctivitis,"Infected newborn infants develop drainage from the eyes within 1 day to 2 weeks after birth.; The eyelids become puffy, red, and tender.; There may be watery, bloody, or thick pus-like drainage from the infant's eyes.","Swollen or inflamed eyes are most commonly caused by:; Bacteria that normally live in a woman's vagina may be passed to the baby during childbirth. More serious eye damage may be caused by:; The mother may not have symptoms at the time of delivery. She still may carry bacteria or viruses that can cause this problem.; A blocked tear duct; Eye drops with antibiotics, given right after birth; Infection by bacteria or viruses; Gonorrhea and chlamydia: These are infections spread from sexual contact.; The viruses that cause genital and oral herpes: These may lead to severe eye damage. Herpes eye infections are less common than those caused by gonorrhea and chlamydia."
001607,Pierre Robin sequence,Pierre Robin syndrome; Pierre Robin complex; Pierre Robin anomaly,"Symptoms of this condition include:; Cleft palate; High-arched palate; Jaw that is very small with a small chin; Jaw that is far back in the throat; Repeated ear infections; Small opening in the roof of the mouth, whichÂ may cause choking or liquids coming back out through the nose; Teeth that appear when the baby is born; Tongue that is large compared to the jaw","The exact causes of Pierre Robin sequence are unknown. It may be part of many genetic syndromes.; The lower jaw develops slowly before birth, but may grow faster during the first few years of life."
001608,Diphtheria,Respiratory diphtheria; Pharyngeal diphtheria; Diphtheric cardiomyopathy; Diphtheric polyneuropathy,"Symptoms usually occur 2 to 5 days after the bacteria enter your body:; Sometimes there are no symptoms.; Fever and chills; Sore throat, hoarseness; Painful swallowing; Croup-like (barking) cough; Drooling (suggests airway blockage is about to occur); Bluish coloration of the skin; Bloody, watery drainage from nose; Breathing problems, including difficulty breathing, fast breathing, high-pitched breathing sound (stridor); Skin sores (usually seen in tropical areas)","The bacteria that cause diphtheria spread through respiratory droplets (such as from a cough or sneeze) of an infected person or someone who carries the bacteria but has no symptoms.; The bacteria most commonly infect your nose and throat. The throat infection causes a gray to black, tough, fiber-like covering, which can block your airways. In some cases, diphtheria infects your skin first and causes skin lesions.; Once you are infected, the bacteria make dangerous substances called toxins. The toxins spread through your bloodstream to other organs, such as the heart and brain, and cause damage.; Because of widespread vaccination (immunization) of children, diphtheria is now rare in many parts of the world.; Risk factors for diphtheria include crowded environments, poor hygiene, and lack of immunization."
001609,Interstitial keratitis,Keratitis interstitial; Cornea - keratitis,Symptoms may include:; Eye pain; Excessive tearing; Sensitivity to light (photophobia),"Interstitial keratitis is a serious condition in which blood vessels grow into the cornea. Such growth can cause loss of the normal clearness of the cornea. This condition is often caused by infections.; Syphilis is the most common cause of interstitial keratitis, but rare causes include:; In the United States, most cases of syphilis are recognized and treated before this eye condition develops.; However, interstitial keratitis accounts for 10% of avoidable blindness in the least developed countries worldwide.Â; Autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis; Leprosy; Lyme disease; Tuberculosis"

001612,Central serous choroidopathy,Central serous retinopathy; Central serous chorioretinopathy,Symptoms may include:; Dim and blurred blind spot in the center of vision; Distortion of straight lines with the affected eye; Objects appearing smaller or farther away with the affected eye,"The cause of this condition is unknown.; Men are affected more often than women, and the condition is most common at around age 45. However, anyone can be affected.; Stress appears to be a risk factor. Early studies found that people with aggressive, ""type A"" personalities who are under a lot of stress may be more likely to develop central serous choroidopathy.; This condition can also occur as a complication of steroid drug use.; It has recently been reported after vaccination for COVID-19, although cause and effect could not be proven."
001613,Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL),Lipofuscinoses; Batten disease; Jansky-Bielschowsky; Kufs disease; Spielmeyer-Vogt; Haltia-Santavuori disease; Hagberg-Santavuori disease,Symptoms of NCL include:; Abnormally increased muscle tone or spasm; Blindness or vision problems; Dementia; Lack of muscle coordination; Intellectual disability; Movement disorder; Loss of speech; Seizures; Unsteady walk,NCL involves the buildup of an abnormal material called lipofuscin in the brain. NCL is thought to be caused by problems with the brain's ability to remove and recycle proteins.; Lipofuscinoses are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. This means each parent passes on a nonworking copy of the gene for the child to develop the condition.; Only one adult subtype of NCL is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.
001614,Cat-scratch disease,CSD; Cat-scratch fever; Bartonellosis,"A person who has had contact with an infected cat may show symptoms, including:; Less common symptoms may include:; Bump (papule) or blister (pustule) at site of injury (usually the first sign); Fatigue; Fever (in some people); Headache; Lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy) near the site of the scratch or bite; Overall discomfort (malaise); Loss of appetite; Sore throat; Weight loss","Cat-scratch disease is caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae. The disease is spread through contact with an infected cat (a bite or scratch) or exposure to cat fleas. It also can be spread through contact with cat saliva on broken skin or mucosal surfaces like those in the nose, mouth, and eyes."

001616,Subconjunctival hemorrhage,,A bright red patch appears on the white of the eye. The patch does not cause pain and there is no discharge from the eye. Vision does not change.,"The white of the eye (sclera) is covered with a thin layer of clear tissue called the bulbar conjunctiva. A subconjunctival hemorrhage occurs when a small blood vessel breaks open and bleeds within the conjunctiva. The blood is often very visible, but since it is confined within the conjunctiva, it does not move and cannot be wiped away. The problem may occur without injury. It is often first noticed when you wake up and look in a mirror.; Some things that may cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage include:; A subconjunctival hemorrhage is common in newborn infants. In this case, the condition is thought to be caused by the pressure changes across the infant's body during childbirth.; Sudden increases in pressure in the head or neck, such as violent sneezing or coughing; Having high blood pressure or taking blood thinners; Rubbing the eyes; Viral infection; Certain eye surgeries or injuries"
001617,Keratosis obturans,,Symptoms may include:; Mild to severe pain; Reduced hearing ability; Inflammation of ear canal,"The exact cause of KO is unknown. It may be due to a problem with how skin cells in the ear canal are produced. Or, it may be caused by overstimulation of the wax glands by the nervous system."
001618,Retinopathy of prematurity,Retrolental fibroplasia; ROP,"The blood vessel changes cannot be seen with the naked eye. An eye exam by an ophthalmologist is needed to reveal such problems.; There are five stages of ROP:; An infant with ROP may also be classified as having ""plus disease"" if the abnormal blood vessels match pictures used to diagnose the condition.; Symptoms of severe ROP include:; Stage I: There is mildly abnormal blood vessel growth.; Stage II: Blood vessel growth is moderately abnormal.; Stage III: Blood vessel growth is severely abnormal.; Stage IV: Blood vessel growth is severely abnormal and there is a partially detached retina.; Stage V: There is a total retinal detachment.; Abnormal eye movements; Crossed eyes; Severe nearsightedness; White-looking pupils (leukocoria)","The blood vessels of the retina (in the back of the eye) begin to develop about 3 months into pregnancy. In most cases, they are fully developed at the time of normal birth. The eyes may not develop properly if a baby is born very early. The vessels may stop growing or grow abnormally from the retina into the back of the eye. Because the vessels are fragile, they can leak and cause bleeding in the eye.; Scar tissue may develop and pull the retina loose from the inner surface of the eye (retinal detachment). In severe cases, this can result in vision loss.; In the past, the use of too much oxygen in treating premature babies caused vessels to grow abnormally. Better methods are now available for monitoring oxygen. As a result, the problem has become less common, especially in developed countries. However, there is still uncertainty about the right level of oxygen for premature babies at different ages. Researchers are studying other factors besides oxygen which appear to influence the risk of ROP.; Today, the risk of developing ROP depends on the degree of prematurity. Smaller babies with more medical problems are at higher risk.; Almost all babies who are born before 30 weeks or weigh less than 3 pounds (1500 grams or 1.5 kilograms) at birth are screened for the condition. Some high-risk babies who weigh 3 to 4.5 pounds (1.5 to 2 kilograms) or who are born after 30 weeks should also be screened.; In addition to prematurity, other risk factors may include:; The rate of ROP in most premature infants has gone down greatly in developed countries over the past few decades due to better care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, more babies born very early are now able to survive, and these very premature infants are at the highest risk for ROP.; Brief stop in breathing (apnea); Heart disease; High carbon dioxide (CO2) level in the blood; Infection; Low blood acidity (pH); Low blood oxygen; Respiratory distress; Slow heart rate (bradycardia); Transfusions"
001619,Blepharitis,Eyelid inflammation; Meibomian gland dysfunction,"Symptoms include:; You may feel like you have sand or dust in your eye when you blink. Sometimes, the eyelashes may fall out. The eyelids may become scarred if the condition continues long-term.; Red, irritated eyelids; Scales that stick to the base of the eyelashes; Burning feeling in the eyelids; Crusting, itching and swelling of the eyelids","The exact cause of blepharitis is unknown. It is thought to be due to:; Blepharitis is more likely to be seen in people with:; An overgrowth of bacteria.; A skin mite called Demodex.; A decrease or breakdown of the normal oils produced by the eyelid.; A skin condition called seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea. This problem involves the scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, skin behind the ears, and the creases of the nose.; Allergies that affect the eyelashes (less common).; Excess growth of the bacteria that are normally found on the skin.; Rosacea, which is a skin condition that causes a red rash on the face."

You may notice:; CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA; Symptoms are most often noticed when the child is a few months old.; SECONDARY GLAUCOMA; Most people have no symptoms.; Once you are aware of vision loss, the damage is already severe.; Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision) is the main type of vision loss.; Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness.; Sudden, severe pain in one eye; Decreased or cloudy vision, often called ""steamy"" vision; Nausea and vomiting; Rainbow-like halos around lights; Red eye; Eye feels swollen; Cloudiness of the front of the eye; Enlargement of one eye or both eyes; Red eye; Sensitivity to light; Tearing; Symptoms are most often related to the underlying problem causing the glaucoma.; Depending on the cause, symptoms may either be like open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma.","Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma:; The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that is in front of the iris, pupil, and angle.; Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye.; Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma.; Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure.; Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include:; Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies.; Open-angle glaucoma; Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma; Congenital glaucoma; Secondary glaucoma; In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow.; In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden.; Either type can damage the optic nerve.; The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it.; The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision.; Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease.; Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.; Acute closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency.; If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your eye doctor is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye.; Medicines such as corticosteroids; Eye diseases, such as uveitis (an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye); Diseases such as diabetes; Eye injury; It often runs in families.; It is present at birth.; It is caused when the eye does not develop normally."
001621,Meibomianitis,Meibomian gland dysfunction,Symptoms include:; Swelling and redness of eyelid edges; Symptoms of dry eye; Slight blurring of vision due to excess oil in tears -- most often cleared by blinking; Frequent styes,"Any condition that increases the oily secretions of the meibomian glands will allow excess oils toÂ build upÂ on the edges of the eyelids. This allows forÂ the excess growth of bacteria that are normally present on the skin.; These problems can be caused by allergies,Â hormone changesÂ during adolescence, or skin conditions such as rosacea and acne.; Meibomianitis is often associated with blepharitis, which can causeÂ a buildup of aÂ dandruff-like substance at the base of the eyelashes.; In some people with meibomianitis, the glands will be plugged so that there is less oil being made for the normal tear film. These people often have symptoms of dry eyes.Â"
001622,Optic nerve atrophy,Optic atrophy; Optic neuropathy,"Optic nerve atrophy causes vision to dim and reduces the field of vision. The ability to see fine detail will also be lost. Colors will seem faded. Over time, the pupil will be less able to react to light, and eventually,Â its ability to react to light may be lost.","There are many causes of optic atrophy. The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma.; Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include:; There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults.

Common causes include mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, staphylococcus, and gonococcus.; Chronic dacryoadenitis is most often due to noninfectious inflammatory disorders. Examples include sarcoidosis, thyroid eye disease, and orbital pseudotumor."
001626,Endophthalmitis,,The symptoms are:; Call your health care provider right away if you have these symptoms after eye surgery.; Decreased vision; Pain; Redness; Swelling of the eyelids,Endophthalmitis is caused by infection with bacteria or a fungus. It very often occurs as a rare complication of cataract or other eye surgery or an injury to the eye.
001627,Ozena,,"Nasal crusting, discharge, congestion, and a very bad smell are other common symptoms of ozena.; Ozena may develop after a long period of nasal swelling.",
001628,Cavernous sinus thrombosis,,"Symptoms include:; Bulging eyeball, usually on one side of face; Cannot move the eye in a particular direction; Drooping eyelids; Headaches; Vision loss","The cavernous sinus is a structure inside the head that receives blood from veins of the face and brain. The blood drains it into other blood vessels that carry it back to the heart. This area also contains nerves that control vision and eye movements.; Cavernous sinus thrombosis is most often caused by a bacterial infection that has spread from the sinuses, teeth, ears, eyes, nose, or skin of the face.; You are more likely to develop this condition if you have an increased risk of blood clots."

The jugular foramen is also where the jugular vein and several important nerves exit the skull.; This area contains nerve fibers, called glomus bodies. Normally, these nerves respond to changes in body temperature or blood pressure.; These tumors most often occur later in life, around age 60 or 70, but they can appear at any age. The cause of a glomus jugulare tumor is unknown. In most cases, there are no known risk factors. Glomus tumors have been associated with changes (mutations) in a gene responsible for the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDHD)."
001635,Glomus tympanum tumor,Paraganglioma - glomus tympanum,Symptoms may include:; Hearing problems or loss; Ringing or heart beat sounds in the ear (pulsatile tinnitus); Weakness or loss of movement in the face (facial nerve palsy),"A glomus tympanum tumor grows in the temporal bone of the skull, behind the eardrum (tympanic membrane).; This area contains nerve fibers (glomus bodies) that normally respond to changes in body temperature or blood pressure.; These tumors most often occur late in life, around age 60 or 70, but they can appear at any age.; The cause of a glomus tympanum tumor is unknown.

They are often caused by lip biting, lip sucking, or other trauma.; Floor of the mouth. These are called ranula. They are caused by blockage of the salivary glands under the tongue."
001640,Tongue tie,Ankyloglossia,"In a newborn or infant, the symptoms of tongue tie are similar to the symptoms in a child who is having problems with breastfeeding. Symptoms may include:; The breastfeeding mother may have problems with breast pain, plugged milk ducts, or painful breasts, and may feel frustrated.; Acting irritable or fussy, even after feeding.; Difficulty creating or keeping suction on the nipple. The infant may become tired in 1 or 2 minutes, or fall asleep before eating enough.; Poor weight gain or weight loss.; Problems latching onto the nipple. The infant may just chew on the nipple instead.; There may be speech and pronunciation difficulties in older children.","The tongue is connected to the bottom of the mouth by a band of tissue called the lingual frenulum. In people with tongue tie, this band is overly short and thick. The exact cause of tongue tie is not known. Your genes may play a role. The problem tends to run in some families."
001641,Nasal polyps,,"If you have small polyps, you may not have any symptoms. If polyps block nasal passages, a sinus infection can develop.; Symptoms include:; With polyps, you may feel like you always have a head cold.; Runny nose; Stuffed up nose; Sneezing; Feeling like your nose is blocked; Loss of smell; Loss of taste; Headache and pain if you also have a sinus infection; Snoring","Nasal polyps can grow anywhere on the lining of the nose or the sinuses. They often grow where the sinuses open into the nasal cavity. Small polyps may not cause any problems. Large polyps can block your sinuses or nasal airway.; Nasal polyps are not cancer. They seem to grow due to long-term swelling and inflammation in the nose from allergies, asthma, or infection.; No one knows exactly why some people get nasal polyps. If you have any of the following conditions, you may be more likely to get nasal polyps:; Aspirin sensitivity; Asthma; Long-term (chronic) sinus infections; Cystic fibrosis; Hay fever"
001642,Choanal atresia,,"Newborns generally prefer to breathe through their nose. Typically, infants only breathe through their mouths when they cry. Babies with choanal atresia have difficulty breathing unless they are crying.; Choanal atresia may affect one or both sides of the nasal airway. Choanal atresia blocking both sides of the nose causes acute breathing problems with bluish discoloration and breathing failure. Such infants may need resuscitation at delivery. More than one half of infants have a blockage on only one side, which causes less severe problems.; Symptoms include:; Chest retracts unless the child is breathing through mouth or crying.; Difficulty breathing following birth, which may result in cyanosis (bluish discoloration), unless infant is crying.; Inability to nurse and breathe at same time.; Inability to pass a catheter through each side of the nose into the throat.; Persistent one-sided nasal blockage or discharge.",The cause of choanal atresia is unknown. It is thought to occur when the thin tissue separating the nose and mouth area during fetal development remains after birth.; The condition is the most common nasal abnormality in newborn infants. Females get this condition about twice as often as males. More than half of affected infants also have other congenital problems.; Choanal atresia is most often diagnosed shortly after birth while the infant is still in the hospital.
001643,Laryngeal nerve damage,Vocal cord paralysis,Symptoms include:; Injury to the left and right laryngeal nerves at the same time can cause a breathing problem. This can be an urgent medical problem.; Difficulty speaking; Difficulty swallowing; Hoarseness,"Injury to the laryngeal nerves is uncommon.; When it does occur, it can be from:; A complication of neck or chest surgery (especially thyroid, lung, heart surgery, or cervical spine surgery); A breathing tube in the windpipe (endotracheal tube); A viral infection that affects the nerves; Tumors in the neck or upper chest, such as thyroid or lung cancer; A neurological condition; Neck or chest trauma"

A child may:; Children with enlarged adenoids may also have more frequent ear infections.; Bad breath; Cracked lips; Dry mouth; Persistent runny nose or nasal congestion; Be restless while sleeping; Snore a lot; Have episodes of not breathing during sleep (sleep apnea)",Enlarged adenoids may be normal. They may grow bigger when the baby grows in the womb. The adenoids help the body prevent or fight infections by trapping bacteria and germs.; Infections can cause the adenoids to become swollen. The adenoids may stay enlarged even when you are not sick.
001650,Osteosarcoma,Osteogenic sarcoma; Bone tumor - osteosarcoma,"The first symptom is usually bone pain near a joint. This symptom may be overlooked, especially in young people, because of other more common causes of joint pain.; Other symptoms may include any of the following:; Bone fracture (may occur after a routine movement); Limitation of motion; Limping (if the tumor is in the leg); Pain when lifting (if the tumor is in the arm); Tenderness, swelling, or redness at the site of the tumor","Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer in children. Average age at diagnosis is 15. Boys and girls are just as likely to develop this tumor until the late teens, after which it occurs more often in boys. Osteosarcoma is also common in people over age 60.; The cause is not known. In some cases, osteosarcoma runs in families. At least one gene has been linked to an increased risk. This gene is also associated with familial retinoblastoma. This is a cancer of the eye that occurs in children.; Osteosarcoma tends to occur in the bones of the:; Osteosarcoma occurs most commonly in large bones in the area of bone with the fastest growth rate. However, it can occur in any bone.; Shin (near the knee); Thigh (near the knee); Upper arm (near the shoulder)"

It affects mainly males, but females may have a milder form. The condition is caused by changes (mutations) in a gene called ""faciogenital dysplasia"" (FGD1)."
001655,Lesch-Nyhan syndrome,,"Too much uric acid can cause gout-like swelling in some of the joints. In some cases, kidney and bladder stones develop.; People with Lesch-Nyhan have delayed motor development followed by abnormal movements and increased reflexes. A striking feature of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is self-destructive behavior, including chewing off fingertips and lips. It is unknown how the disease causes these problems.","Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is passed down as an X-linked, or sex-linked trait. It occurs mostly in boys. People with this syndrome are missing or severely lacking an enzyme called hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). The body needs this substance to recycle purines. Without it, abnormally high levels of uric acid build up in the body."
001656,Noonan syndrome,,Symptoms include:; Delayed puberty; Down-slanting or widely-spaced eyes; Hearing loss (varies); Low-set or abnormally shaped ears; Mild intellectual disability (only in about 25% of cases); Sagging eyelids (ptosis); Short stature; Small penis; Undescended testicles; Unusual chest shape (most often a sunken chest called pectus excavatum); Webbed and short-appearing neck,"Noonan syndrome is linked to variants in several genes. In general, certain proteins involved in growth and development become overactive as a result of these gene changes.; Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. This means only one parent has to pass down the variant gene for the child to have the syndrome. However, some cases may not be inherited and instead happen by chance (spontaneously)."
001657,Progeria,Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome; HGPS,"Symptoms include:; Growth failure during the first year of life; Narrow, shrunken or wrinkled face; Baldness; Loss of eyebrows and eyelashes; Short stature; Large head for size of face (macrocephaly); Open soft spot of the skull (fontanelle); Small jaw (micrognathia); Dry, scaly, thin skin; Limited range of motion; Teeth - delayed or absent formation","Progeria is a rare condition.

The condition can be passed down through families (inherited). However, most of the time, there is not another affected family member.; This condition may vary in severity from generation to generation and from person to person."
001660,Trisomy 13,Patau syndrome,"Symptoms include:; Cleft lip or palate; Clenched hands (with outer fingers on top of the inner fingers); Close-set eyes -- eyes may actually fuse together into one; Decreased muscle tone; Extra fingers or toes (polydactyly); Hernias: umbilical hernia, inguinal hernia; Hole, split, or cleft in the iris (coloboma); Low-set ears; Intellectual disability, severe; Scalp defects (missing skin); Seizures; Single palmar crease; Skeletal (limb) abnormalities; Small eyes; Small head (microcephaly); Small lower jaw (micrognathia); Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism)","Trisomy 13 occurs when extra DNA from chromosome 13 appears in some or all of the body's cells.; The extra material interferes with normal development.; Trisomy 13 occurs in about 1 out of every 10,000 newborns. Most cases are not passed down through families (inherited). Instead, the events that lead to trisomy 13 occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.; Trisomy 13: the presence of an extra (third) chromosome 13 in all of the cells.; Mosaic trisomy 13: the presence of an extra chromosome 13 in some of the cells.; Partial trisomy 13: the presence of a part of an extra chromosome 13 in the cells."

Instead, the events that lead to trisomy 18 occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.; Trisomy 18: the presence of an extra (third) chromosome 18 in all of the cells.; Mosaic trisomy 18: the presence of an extra chromosome 18 in some of the cells.; Partial trisomy 18: the presence of a part of an extra chromosome 18 in the cells."
001662,Aase syndrome,"Aase-Smith syndrome; Hypoplastic anemia - triphalangeal thumbs, Aase-Smith type; Diamond-Blackfan with AS-II; Aase-Smith I syndrome; Hydrocephalus-cleft palate-joint contractures syndrome",Symptoms may include:; Absent or small knuckles; Cleft palate; Deformed ears; Droopy eyelids; Inability to fully extend the joints from birth; Narrow shoulders; Pale skin; Triple-jointed thumbs,"Many cases of Aase syndrome occur without a known reason and are not passed down through families (inherited). However, some cases (45%) have been shown to be inherited. These are due to a change in 1 of 20 genes important for making protein correctly (the genes make ribosomal proteins).; This condition is similar to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the two conditions should considered the same. A missing piece on chromosome 19 is found in some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.; The anemia in Aase syndrome is caused by poor development of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed."
001663,Adrenocortical carcinoma,Tumor - adrenal; ACC - adrenal,"Symptoms of increased cortisol or other adrenal gland hormones may include:; Symptoms of increased aldosterone are the same as symptoms of low potassium, and include:; Fatty, rounded hump high on the back just below the neck (buffalo hump); Flushed, rounded face with pudgy cheeks (moon face); Obesity; Stunted growth (short stature); Virilization -- the appearance of male characteristics, including increased body hair (especially on the face), pubic hair, acne, deepening of the voice, and enlarged clitoris (females); Muscle cramps; Weakness; Pain in the abdomen","ACC is most common in children younger than 5 years old and adults in their 40s and 50s.; The condition may be linked to a cancer syndrome that is passed down through families (inherited).

In women the tumor often releases these hormones, which can lead to male characteristics.; ACC is very rare. The cause is unknown."
001664,Aicardi syndrome,Agenesis of corpus callosum with chorioretinal abnormality; Agenesis of corpus callosum with infantile spasms and ocular abnormalities; Callosal agenesis and ocular abnormalities; Chorioretinal anomalies with ACC,"Symptoms most often start when the child is between ages 3 and 5 months. The condition causes jerking (infantile spasms), a type of childhood seizure.; Aicardi syndrome may occur with other brain defects.; Other symptoms may include:; Coloboma (cat's eye); Intellectual disability; Smaller-than-normal eyes (microphthalmia)","The cause of Aicardi syndrome is unknown at this time. In some cases, experts believe it may be a result of a gene defect on the X chromosome.; The disorder affects only girls."

This means both of your parents must pass on a copy of the defective gene (ALMS1) in order for you to have this disease.; It is unknown how the defective gene causes the disorder.; The condition is very rare.
001666,Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome,Abetalipoproteinemia; Acanthocytosis; Apolipoprotein B deficiency,"Symptoms include:; Balance and coordination difficulties; Curvature of spine; Decreased vision that gets worse over time; Developmental delay; Failure to thrive (grow) in infancy; Muscle weakness; Poor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10; Protruding abdomen; Slurred speech; Stool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools",Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by changes in the MTTP gene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with protein). These variants make it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins.
001667,Ellis-van Creveld syndrome,Chondroectodermal dysplasia; EVC,"Symptoms may include:; Cleft lip or palate; Epispadias or undescended testicle (cryptorchidism); Extra fingers (polydactyly); Limited range of motion; Nail problems, including missing or deformed nails; Short arms and legs, especially forearm and lower leg; Short height, between 3.5Â to 5 feet (1Â to 1.5 meters) tall; Sparse, absent, or fine textured hair; Tooth abnormalities, such as peg teeth, widely-spaced teeth; Teeth present at birth (natal teeth); Delayed or missing teeth","Ellis-van Creveld is passed down through families (inherited). It is caused by defects in 1 of 2 Ellis-van Creveld syndrome genes (EVC and EVC2). These genes are positioned next to each other on the same chromosome.; The severity of the disease varies from person to person. The highest rate of the condition is seen among the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. It is fairly rare in the general population."

A small part of the gene code is repeated several times in one area of the X chromosome. The more repeats (also called gene expansion), the more likely the condition will occur.; The FMR1 gene makes a protein needed for your brain to function properly. A defect in the gene makes your body produce too little of the protein, or none at all.; Boys and girls can both be affected, but because boys have only one X chromosome, a single fragile X expansion is likely to affect them more severely. You can have fragile X syndrome even if your parents do not have it.; A family history of fragile X syndrome, developmental problems, or intellectual disability may not be present."

002473,Lead poisoning,Plumbism,"There are many possible symptoms of lead poisoning. Lead can affect many different parts of the body. A single high dose of lead can cause severe emergency symptoms.; However, it is more common for lead poisoning to occur slowly over time. This results from repeated exposure to small amounts of lead. In this case, there may not be any obvious symptoms. Over time, even low levels of lead exposure can harm a child's mental development. The health problems get worse as the level of lead in the blood gets higher.; Lead is much more harmful to children than adults because it can affect children's developing nerves and brains. The younger the child, the more harmful lead can be. Unborn children are the most vulnerable.; Possible complications include:; The symptoms of lead poisoning may include:; Very high levels of lead may cause vomiting, internal bleeding, staggering walk, muscle weakness, seizures, or coma.; Behavior or attention problems; Failure at school; Hearing problems; Kidney damage; Reduced IQ; Slowed body growth; Abdominal pain and cramping (usually the first sign of a high, toxic dose of lead); Aggressive behavior; Anemia (low red blood cell count); Constipation; Difficulty getting pregnant; Difficulty sleeping; Headaches; Hearing loss; Irritability; Loss of previous developmental skills (in young children); Low appetite and energy; Reduced sensations",

General symptoms may include:; Symptoms in the joints can:; Skin changes may also occur, such as:; A condition that affects the brain and nervous system, called Sydenham chorea, can also occur. Symptoms of this condition are:; Fever; Nosebleeds; Pain in the abdomen; Heart problems, which may have no symptoms, or may lead to shortness of breath and chest pain; Cause pain, swelling, redness, and warmth; Mainly occur in the knees, elbows, ankles, and wrists; Change or move from one joint to another; Ring-shaped or snake-like skin rash on the trunk and upper part of the arms or legs; Skin lumps or nodules; Loss of control of emotions, with bouts of unusual crying or laughing; Quick, jerky movements that mainly affect the face, feet, and hands","Rheumatic fever is still common in countries that have a lot of poverty and poor health systems. It does not often occur in the United States and other developed countries. When rheumatic fever does occur in the United States, it is most often in small outbreaks. The latest outbreak in the United StatesÂ was in the 1980s.; Rheumatic fever occurs after infections with a germ or bacteria called Streptococcus pyogenes or group A streptococcus. This germ appears to trick the immune system into attacking healthy tissues in the body. These tissues become swollen or inflamed.; This abnormal reaction seems to almost always occur with strep throat or scarlet fever. Strep infections that involve other parts of the body do not seem to trigger rheumatic fever."

For example, it can develop in someone who has a problem with an area of the brain called the brainstem, which controls breathing.; Conditions that can cause or lead to central sleep apnea include:; If the apnea is not associated with another disease, it is called idiopathic central sleep apnea.; A condition called Cheyne-Stokes respiration can affect people with severe heart failure and can be associated with central sleep apnea. The breathing pattern involves alternating deep and heavy breathing with shallow, or even not breathing, usually while sleeping.; Central sleep apnea is not the same as obstructive sleep apnea. With obstructive sleep apnea, breathing stops and starts because the airway is narrowed or blocked. Central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea can be present in the same person.; Problems that affect the brainstem, including brain infection, stroke, or conditions of the cervical spine (neck); Certain medicines, such as narcotic painkillers; Being at high altitude"

Younger children may turn up the television volume because of hearing loss.","The Eustachian tube connects the inside of the ear to the back of the throat. This tube helps drain fluid to prevent it from building up in the ear. The fluid drains from the tube and is swallowed.; OME and ear infections are connected in two ways:; The following can cause swelling of the Eustachian tube lining that leads to increased fluid in the middle ear:; The following can cause the Eustachian tube to close or become blocked:; Getting water in a baby's ears will not lead to a blocked Eustachian tube.; OME is most common in winter or early spring, but it can occur at any time of year. It can affect people of any age. It occurs most often in children under age 2, but is rare in newborns.; Younger children get OME more often than older children or adults for several reasons:; The fluid in OME is often thin and watery. In the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear. (""Glue ear"" is a common name given to OME with thick fluid.) However, fluid thickness is now thought to beÂ related to the ear itself, rather than to how long the fluid is present.; After most ear infections have been treated, fluid (an effusion) remains in the middle ear for a few days or weeks.; When the Eustachian tube is partially blocked, fluid builds up in the middle ear. Bacteria inside the ear become trapped and begin to grow. This may lead to an ear infection.; Allergies; Irritants (particularly cigarette smoke); Respiratory infections; Drinking while lying on your back; Sudden increases in air pressure (such as descending in an airplane or on a mountain road); The tube is shorter, more horizontal, and straighter, making it easier for bacteria to enter.; The tube is floppier, with a tinier opening that's easy to block.; Young children get more colds because it takes time for the immune system to be able to recognize and ward off cold viruses."

You feel this pain when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The pain may feel different from person to person.; Some people have symptoms other than chest pain, such as:; It may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may feel it under your breast bone (sternum). You may also feel it in your neck, arms, stomach, or upper back.; The pain most often occurs with activity or emotion.

This may also be called hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis.; A risk factor for heart disease is something that increases your chance of getting it. You cannot change some risk factors for heart disease, but you can change others.; Fatty material and other substances form a plaque buildup on the walls of your coronary arteries.

The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.; A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause of this type of anemia in children. When a child is growing rapidly, such as during puberty, even more iron is needed.; Toddlers who drink too much cow's milk may also become anemic because too much cow's milk makes it difficult for the body to absorb iron. Also, children who drink too much cow's milk may not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.; Other causes may be:; Iron deficiency in children can also be related to lead poisoning.; The body is not able to absorb iron well, even though the child is eating enough iron.; Slow blood loss over a long period, often due to menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive tract."

In some cases, the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the pain. Another theory is that CRPS is caused by a triggering of the immune response, which leads to the inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area.; CRPS has two forms:; CRPS is thought to result from damage to the nervous system. This includes the nerves that control the blood vessels and sweat glands.; The damaged nerves are no longer able to properly control blood flow, feeling (sensation), and temperature to the affected area. This leads to problems in the:; Possible causes of CRPS:; In rare cases, sudden illnesses such as a heart attack or stroke can cause CRPS.

Mild disease, generally called West Nile fever, may cause some or all of the following symptoms:; These symptoms usually last for 3 to 6 days, but may last a month.; More severe forms of disease are called West Nile encephalitis or West Nile meningitis, depending on what part of the body is affected. The following symptoms can occur, and need prompt attention:; Abdominal pain; Fever, headache, and sore throat; Lack of appetite; Muscle aches; Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; Rash; Swollen lymph nodes; Confusion or change in ability to think clearly; Loss of consciousness or coma; Muscle weakness; Stiff neck; Weakness of one arm or leg","West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda in eastern Africa. It was first discovered in the United States in the summer of 1999 in New York. Since then, the virus has spread throughout the US.; Researchers believe West Nile virus is spread when a mosquito bites an infected bird and then bites a person.; Mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of the virus in the late summer and early fall, which is why more people get the disease in late August to early September. As the weather becomes colder and mosquitoes die off, there are fewer cases of the disease.; Although many people are bitten by mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus, most do not know they have been infected.; Risk factors for developing a more severe form of West Nile virus include:; West Nile virus may also be spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. It is possible for an infected mother to spread the virus to her child through breast milk.; Conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, and recent chemotherapy; Older or very young age; Pregnancy"

It is one of the coronavirus family of viruses (the same family that can cause the common cold). An epidemic of SARS started in 2003 when the virus spread from small mammals to people in China.Â This outbreak quickly reached global proportions, but was contained in 2003. No new cases of SARS have been reported since 2004.; When someone with SARS coughs or sneezes, infected droplets spray into the air. You can catch the SARS virus if you breathe in or touch these particles. The SARS virus may live on hands, tissues, and other surfaces for up to several hours in these droplets. The virus may be able to live for months or years when the temperature is below freezing.; While the spread of droplets through close contact caused most of the early SARS cases, SARS might also spread by hands and other objects the droplets has touched. Airborne transmission is a real possibility in some cases. Live virus has also been found in the stool of people with SARS, where it has been shown to live for up to 4 days.; With other coronaviruses, becoming infected and then getting sick again (reinfection) is common. This may also be the case with SARS.; Symptoms usually occur 2 to 10 days after coming in contact with the virus. People with active symptoms of illness are contagious. But it is not known for how long a person may be contagious after symptoms appear."
007193,Premenstrual dysphoric disorder,PMDD; Severe PMS; Menstrual disorder - dysphoric,"The symptoms of PMDD are similar to those of PMS. However, they are very often more severe and debilitating.

Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined.; Lung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45.; Smoking causes most cases (around 80%) of non-small cell lung cancer. The risk depends on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and for how long you have smoked. Being around the smoke from other people (secondhand smoke) also raises your risk of lung cancer. The risk decreases with time after you stop smoking. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk. Some people who have never smoked do develop lung cancer.; Research shows that smoking marijuana may help cancer cells grow. But there is no direct link between smoking marijuana and developing lung cancer.; Constant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk.; Working with or living near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Such chemicals include:; Arsenic; Asbestos; Radon; Chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust; Certain alloys, paints, pigments, and preservatives; Products using chloride and formaldehyde"

This happens because the brain and muscles are not receiving blood from the heart.; The following symptoms may occur within minutes to 1 hour before the collapse:; Chest pain; Dizziness; Nausea; Rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations); Shortness of breath,"The heart pumps blood to the lungs, brain, and other organs. If the heartbeat is interrupted, even for a few seconds, it can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest.; Fibrillation is an uncontrolled twitching or quivering of muscle fibers (fibrils). When it occurs in the lower chambers of the heart, it is called VF. During VF, blood is not pumped from the heart. Sudden cardiac death results.; The most common cause of VF is a heart attack. However, VF can occur whenever the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. Conditions that can lead to VF include:; Many people with VF have no history of heart disease. However, they often have heart disease risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes.; Electrocution accidents or injury to the heart; Heart attack or angina; Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital); Heart muscle disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and stretched or thickened; Heart surgery; Sudden cardiac death (commotio cordis); most often occurs in athletes who have had a sudden blow to the area directly over the heart; Medicines; Very high or very low potassium levels in the blood"

Some women have several lumps that may affect both breasts.; The lumps may be any of the following:; The lumps have smooth, well-defined borders. They may grow in size, especially during pregnancy. Fibroadenomas often get smaller after menopause (if a woman is not taking hormone therapy).; Easily moveable under the skin; Firm; Painless; Rubbery",The cause of fibroadenomas is not known. They may be related to hormones. Girls who are going through puberty and women who are pregnant are most often affected. Fibroadenomas are found much less often in older women who have gone through menopause.; Fibroadenoma is the most common benign tumor of the breast. It is the most common breast tumor in women under age 30.; A fibroadenoma is made up of breast gland tissue and tissue that helps support the breast gland tissue.

Primary brain tumors can start from brain cells, the membranes around the brain (meninges), nerves, or glands.; Tumors can directly destroy brain cells. They can also damage cells by producing inflammation, placing pressure on other parts of the brain, and increasing pressure within the skull.; The cause of primary brain tumors is unknown. There are many risk factors that could play a role:; These have not proven to be risk factors:; SPECIFIC TUMOR TYPES; Brain tumors are classified depending on:; Sometimes, tumors that start out less aggressive can change their biologic behavior and become more aggressive.; Tumors can occur at any age, but many types are most common in a certain age group. In adults, gliomas and meningiomas are the most common.; Gliomas come from glial cells around the nerve cells of the brain such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells. Gliomas are divided into three types:; Meningiomas and schwannomas are two other types of brain tumors. These tumors:; Other primary brain tumors in adults are rare. These include:; Radiation therapy used to treat brain cancers increases the risk of brain tumors up to 20 or 30 years later.; Some inherited conditions increase the risk of brain tumors, including neurofibromatosis, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Turcot syndrome.; Lymphomas that begin in the brain in people with a weakened immune system (such as people with HIV) are sometimes linked to infection by the Epstein-Barr virus.; Exposure to radiation at work, or to power lines, cell phones, cordless phones, or wireless devices; Head injuries; Smoking; Hormone therapy; Location of the tumor; Type of tissue involved; Whether they are noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant); Other factors; Astrocytic tumors include astrocytomas (can be noncancerous), anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas.; Oligodendroglial tumors. Some primary brain tumors are made up of both astrocytic and oligodendrocytic tumors.

007227,Apnea of prematurity,Apnea - newborns; AOP; As and Bs; A/B/D; Blue spell - newborns; Dusky spell - newborns; Spell - newborns; Apnea - neonatal,"The breathing pattern of newborns is not always regular and may be called ""periodic breathing."" This pattern is even more likely in newborns born early. It consists of episodes of either shallow breathing or short pauses in breathing lasting just a few seconds. These episodes are then followed by periods of regular breathing. This is generally considered a normal pattern and can be expected in less mature and even some full-term babies. However, the pattern of breathing, length of breathing pauses, and the age of the baby are both important when deciding if it needs to be further evaluated.; Apnea episodes or ""events"" that last longer than 20 seconds are considered serious. The baby may also have a:; Drop in heart rate. This heart rate drop is called bradycardia (also called a ""brady"").; Drop in oxygen level (oxygen saturation). This is called desaturation (also called a ""desat"").","There are several reasons why newborns, in particular those who were born early (prematurely), may have apnea, including:; Other stresses in a sick or premature baby may worsen apnea, including:; The brain areas and nerve pathways that control breathing are still developing.; The muscles that keep the airway open are smaller and not as strong as they will be later in life.; Anemia; Feeding problems; Heart or lung problems; Infection; Low oxygen levels; Temperature problems"
007228,Hyperglycemia - infants,High blood sugar - infants; High blood glucose level - infants,"Babies with hyperglycemia often have no symptoms.; Sometimes, babies with high blood sugar will produce large amounts of urine and become dehydrated. High blood sugar may be a sign that the baby has added stress on the body due to problems such as an infection or heart failure.","A healthy baby's body most often has very careful control of the blood sugar level by normal bodily systems. Insulin is the main hormone in the body that regulates blood sugar. Sick babies may have poor insulin function or low amounts. This causes poor control of the blood sugar.; There can be specific causes of ineffective insulin function or a low insulin level. Causes may include infection, liver problems, hormone problems, and some medicines. Rarely, babies may actually have diabetes, and therefore have a low insulin level that results in high blood sugar."
007229,Low calcium level  - infants,Hypocalcemia - infants,"Babies with hypocalcemia often have no symptoms. Sometimes, babies with low blood calcium levels are jittery or have tremors or twitching. Rarely, they have seizures.; These babies may also have a slow heart rate and low blood pressure.","A healthy baby most often has very careful control of the blood calcium level by normal bodily systems.; A low calcium level in the blood is more likely to occur in newborns, more commonly in those who were born too early (preemies). Common causes of hypocalcemia in a newborn include:; There are also some rare illnesses that can lead to low blood calcium level. These include:; Certain medicines; Diabetes in the birth mother; Episodes of very low oxygen levels; Infection; Stress caused by serious illness; DiGeorge syndrome, a genetic disorder.; The parathyroid glands help control calcium use and removal by the body. Rarely, a child is born with underactive parathyroid glands."
007230,Neutropenia - infants,,,"White blood cells (WBCs) are produced in the bone marrow. They are released into the bloodstream and travel wherever they are needed. Low levels of neutrophils occur when the bone marrow cannot replace them as fast as needed.; In babies, the most common cause is infection. A very severe infection may cause neutrophils to be used up quickly. It may also prevent the bone marrow from producing more neutrophils.; Sometimes, an infant who is not sick will have a low neutrophil count for no obvious reason. Some disorders in the pregnant mother, such as preeclampsia, can also lead to neutropenia in infants.; In rare cases, mothers may have antibodies against their baby's neutrophils. These antibodies cross the placenta before birth and cause the baby's cells to break down (alloimmune neutropenia). In other rare cases, a problem with the baby's bone marrow may lead to decreased WBC production."
007231,Osteopenia - premature infants,Neonatal rickets; Brittle bones - premature infants; Weak bones - premature infants; Osteopenia of prematurity,"Most premature infants born before 30 weeks have some degree of osteopenia, but will not have any physical symptoms.; Infants with severe osteopenia may have decreased movement or swelling of an arm or leg due to an unknown fracture.","During the last 3 months of pregnancy, large amounts of calcium and phosphorus are transferred from the mother to the baby. This helps the baby grow.; A premature infant may not receive the proper amount of calcium and phosphorus needed to form strong bones. While in the womb, fetal activity increases during the last 3 months of pregnancy. This activity is thought to be important for bone development. Most very premature infants have limited physical activity. This may also contribute to weak bones.; Very premature babies lose much more phosphorus in their urine than do babies that are born full-term.; A lack of vitamin D may also lead to osteopenia in infants. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium from the intestines and kidneys. If babies do not receive or make enough vitamin D, calcium and phosphorous will not be properly absorbed. A liver problem called cholestasis may also cause problems with vitamin D levels.; Water pills (diuretics) or steroids can also cause low calcium levels."
007232,Periventricular leukomalacia,PVL; Brain injury - infants; Encephalopathy of prematurity,,"PVL is much more common in premature infants than in full-term infants.; A major cause is thought to be changes in blood flow to the area around the ventricles of the brain. This area is fragile and prone to injury, especially before 32 weeks of gestation.; Infection around the time of delivery may also play a role in causing PVL. The risk for PVL is higher for babies who are more premature and more unstable at birth.; Premature babies who have intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) are also at increased risk for developing this condition."
007233,Transient tachypnea - newborn,TTN; Wet lungs - newborns; Retained fetal lung fluid; Transient RDS; Prolonged transition; Neonatal - transient tachypnea,"Newborns with TTN have breathing problems soon after birth, usually starting within 1 to 2 hours.; Symptoms include:; Bluish skin color (cyanosis); Rapid breathing, which may occur with noises such as grunting; Flaring nostrils or movements between the ribs or breastbone known as retractions","As the baby grows in the womb (uterus), the lungs make a special fluid. This fluid fills the baby's lungs and helps them grow. When the baby is born at term, hormones released during labor tell the lungs to stop making this special fluid. The baby's lungs start removing or reabsorbing it.; The first few breaths a baby takes after delivery fill the lungs with air and help to clear most of the remaining lung fluid.; Leftover fluid in the lungs causes the baby to breathe rapidly. It is harder for the small air sacs of the lungs to stay open.; TTN is more likely to occur in babies who are:; Born before 38 completed weeks gestation (preterm, or early term); Delivered by C-section, especially if labor has not already started; Born to a mother with diabetes or asthma; Twins"

In most cases, it is perfectly natural. People sweat more in warm temperatures, when they exercise, or in response to situations that make them nervous, angry, embarrassed, or afraid.; Excessive sweating occurs without such triggers. People with hyperhidrosis appear to have overactive sweat glands. The uncontrollable sweating can lead to significant discomfort, both physical and emotional.; When excessive sweating affects the hands, feet, and armpits, it is called focal hyperhidrosis. In most cases, no cause can be found. It seems to run in families.; Sweating that is not caused by another disease is called primary hyperhidrosis.; If the sweating occurs as a result of another medical condition, it is called secondary hyperhidrosis.

After a while, the bone can collapse. If osteonecrosis is not treated, the joint deteriorates, leading to severe arthritis.; Osteonecrosis can be caused by disease or by severe trauma, such as a fracture or dislocation, that affects the blood supply to the bone. Osteonecrosis can also occur without trauma or disease. This is called idiopathic -- meaning it occurs without any known cause.; The following are possible causes:; When osteonecrosis occurs in the shoulder joint, it is usually due to long-term treatment with steroids, a history of trauma to the shoulder, or the person has sickle cell disease or any abnormal blood clotting conditions.; Using oral or intravenous steroids; Excessive alcohol use; Sickle cell disease or any blood condition that causes abnormal blood clotting; Dislocation or fractures around a joint; Clotting disorders; HIV or taking HIV drugs; Radiation therapy or chemotherapy; Gaucher disease (disease in which harmful substances build-up in certain organs and the bones); Systemic lupus erythematosus (an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue such as the skin, joints, and certain organs); Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (childhood disease in which the thigh bone in the hip doesn't get enough blood, causing the bone to die); Decompression sickness from a lot of deep sea diving"

Many of us do. Most of the time, it does not cause an infection or any symptoms. This is called ""colonization"" or ""being colonized."" Someone who is colonized with MRSA can spread it to other people.; A sign of a staph skin infection is a red, swollen, and painful area on the skin. Pus or other fluids may drain from this area. It may look like a boil. These symptoms are more likely to occur if the skin has been cut or rubbed, because this gives the MRSA germ a way to enter your body. Symptoms are also more likely in areas where there is more body hair, because the germ can get into hair follicles.; MRSA infection in people who are in health care facilities tends to be severe. These infections may be in the bloodstream, heart, lungs or other organs, urine, or in the area of a recent surgery. Some symptoms of these severe infections may include:; Chest pain; Cough or shortness of breath; Fatigue; Fever and chills; General ill feeling; Headache; Rash; Wounds that do not heal","Most staph germs are spread by skin-to-skin contact (touching). A doctor, nurse, other health care provider, or visitors to a hospital may have staph germs on their body that can spread to a patient.; Once the staph germ enters the body, it can spread to bones, joints, the blood, or any organ, such as the lungs, heart, or brain.; Serious staph infections are more common in people with chronic (long-term) medical problems. These include those who:; MRSA infections can also occur in healthy people who have not recently been in the hospital. Most of these MRSA infections are on the skin, or less commonly, in the lung.

Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined.; Lung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45.; Smoking causes most cases (around 90%) of lung cancer. The risk depends on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and for how long you have smoked. Being around the smoke from other people (secondhand smoke) also raises your risk of lung cancer. The risk decreases with time after you stop smoking. But some people who have never smoked do develop lung cancer. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk.; Research shows that smoking marijuana may help cancer cells grow. But there is no direct link between smoking marijuana and developing lung cancer.; Constant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk.; Working with or living near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer.

This means that the tumor started within the heart. Most heart tumors start somewhere else.; Primary cardiac tumors such as myxomas are rare. About 75% of myxomas occur in the left atrium of the heart. They most often begin in the wall that divides the two upper chambers of the heart. They can occur in other intra-cardiac sites as well. Atrial myxomas are sometimes linked with valve obstruction stenosis and atrial fibrillation.; Myxomas are more common in women. About 1 in 10 myxomas are passed down through families (inherited).

The most common symptoms seen in premature infants include:; Breathing pauses (apnea); Changes in blood pressure and heart rate; Decreased muscle tone; Decreased reflexes; Excessive sleep; Lethargy; Weak suck; Seizures and other abnormal movements,"Infants born more than 10 weeks early are at highest risk for this type of bleeding. The smaller and more premature an infant is, the higher the risk for IVH. This is because blood vessels in the brain of premature infants are not yet fully developed. They are very fragile as a result. The blood vessels grow stronger in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy.; IVH is more common in premature babies with:; The problem may also occur in otherwise healthy babies who were born early. Rarely, IVH may develop in full-term babies.; IVH is rarely present at birth. It occurs most often in the first several days of life. The condition is rare after the first month of age, even if the baby was born early.; There are four types of IVH. These are called ""grades"" and are based on the degree of bleeding.; Respiratory distress syndrome; Unstable blood pressure; Other medical conditions at birth; Grades 1 and 2 involve a smaller amount of bleeding. Most of the time, there are no long-term problems as a result of the bleeding. Grade 1 is also referred to as germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH).; Grades 3 and 4 involve more severe bleeding. The blood presses on (grade 3) or directly involves (grade 4) brain tissue. Grade 4 is also called an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Blood clots can form and block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. This can lead to increased fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus)."

007303,Neonatal sepsis,Sepsis neonatorum; Neonatal septicemia; Sepsis - infant,Infants with neonatal sepsis may have the following symptoms:; Body temperature changes; Breathing problems; Diarrhea or decreased bowel movements; Low blood sugar; Reduced movements; Reduced sucking; Seizures; Slow or fast heart rate; Swollen belly area; Vomiting; Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice),"Neonatal sepsis can be caused by bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E coli), Listeria, and some strains of streptococcus. Group B streptococcus (GBS) has been a major cause of neonatal sepsis. However, this problem has become less common because women are screened for GBS during pregnancy. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) can also cause a severe infection in a newborn baby. This happens most often when the mother is newly infected with HSV.; Early-onset neonatal sepsis most often appears within 24 to 48 hours of birth. The baby gets the infection from the mother before or during delivery. The following increase an infant's risk of early-onset bacterial sepsis:; Babies with late-onset neonatal sepsis are infected after delivery. The following increase an infant's risk for sepsis after delivery:; GBS colonization during pregnancy; Preterm delivery; Water breaking (rupture of membranes) longer than 18 hours before birth; Infection of the placenta tissues and amniotic fluid (chorioamnionitis); Having a catheter in a blood vessel for a long time; Staying in the hospital for an extended period of time"

007306,Low blood sugar - newborns,Neonatal hypoglycemia,"Infants with low blood sugar may not have symptoms. If your baby has one of the risk factors for low blood sugar, nurses in the hospital will check your baby's blood sugar level, even if there are no symptoms.; Also, the blood sugar level is usually checked for babies with these symptoms:; Bluish-colored or pale skin; Breathing problems, such as pauses in breathing (apnea), rapid breathing, or a grunting sound; Irritability or listlessness; Loose or floppy muscles; Poor feeding or vomiting; Problems keeping the body warm; Tremors, shakiness, sweating, or seizures","Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.; The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk, or from formula. The baby can also produce some glucose in the liver.; The glucose level can drop if:; Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the glucose level of a newborn causes symptoms or is below the range considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1000 births.; Low blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:; There is too much insulin in the blood. Insulin is a hormone that moves glucose from the blood into tissues.; The baby is not able to produce enough glucose.; The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.; The baby is not able to take in enough glucose by feeding.; Born early, has a serious infection, and/or needed oxygen right after delivery; Mother has diabetes; Slower than expected growth in the womb during pregnancy; Smaller or larger in size than expected for their gestational age"
007307,Myocarditis - pediatric,,"Symptoms may be mild at first and hard to detect. Sometimes in newborns and infants, symptoms may appear suddenly.; Symptoms may include:; Symptoms in children over age 2 may also include:; Anxiety; Failure to thrive or poor weight gain; Feeding difficulties; Fever and other symptoms of infection; Listlessness; Low urine output (a sign of decreasing kidney function); Pale, cool hands and feet (a sign of poor circulation); Rapid breathing; Rapid heart rate; Belly area pain and nausea; Chest pain; Cough; Fatigue; Shortness of breath; Swelling (edema) in the legs, feet, and face","Myocarditis is rare in young children. It is slightly more common in older children and adults. It is often worse in newborns and young infants than in children over age 2.; Most cases in children are caused by a virus that reaches the heart. These can include:; It may also be caused by bacterial infections such as Lyme disease.; Other causes of pediatric myocarditis include:; Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination has been reported, but is very rare.; The heart muscle may be directly damaged by the virus or the bacteria that infect it. The body's immune response can also damage the heart muscle (called the myocardium) in the process of fighting the infection. This can lead to symptoms of heart failure.; Influenza (flu) virus; Coxsackie virus; Parovirus; Adenovirus; SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19); Allergic reactions to certain medicines; Exposure to chemicals in the environment; Infections due to fungus or parasites; Radiation; Some diseases (autoimmune disorders) that cause inflammation throughout the body; Some drugs"
007308,Hydrops fetalis,,Symptoms depend on the severity of the condition. Mild forms may cause:; More severe forms may cause:; Liver swelling; Change in skin color (pallor); Breathing problems; Bruising or purplish bruise-like spots on the skin; Heart failure; Severe anemia; Severe jaundice; Total body swelling,"There are two types of hydrops fetalis, immune and nonimmune. The type depends on the cause of the abnormal fluid.; The number of babies who develop immune hydrops fetalis has dropped due to a medicine called RhoGAM. This drug is given as an injection to pregnant mothers who are at risk for Rh incompatibility. The drug prevents them from making antibodies against their babies' red blood cells. There are other, much rarer, blood group incompatibilities that can also cause immune hydrops fetalis, but RhoGAM does not help with these.; Immune hydrops fetalis is most often a complication of a severe form of Rh incompatibility, which can be prevented. This is a condition in which mother who has Rh negative blood type makes antibodies to her baby's Rh positive blood cells, and the antibodies cross the placenta. Rh incompatibility causes a large number of red blood cells in the fetus to be destroyed (also known as hemolytic disease of the newborn). This leads to problems including total body swelling. Severe swelling can interfere with how the body organs work.; Nonimmune hydrops fetalis is more common. It accounts for up to 90% of cases of hydrops. The condition occurs when a disease or medical condition affects the body's ability to manage fluid. There are three main causes for this type, heart or lung problems, severe anemia (such as from thalassemia or infections), and genetic or developmental problems, including Turner syndrome."
007309,Bilirubin encephalopathy,Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND); Kernicterus,"The symptoms depend on the stage of BE. Not all babies with kernicterus on autopsy have had definite symptoms.; Early stage:; Middle stage:; Late stage:; Extreme jaundice; Absent startle reflex; Poor feeding or sucking; Extreme sleepiness (lethargy) and low muscle tone (hypotonia); High-pitched cry; Irritability; May have arched back with neck hyperextended backwards, high muscle tone (hypertonia); Poor feeding; Stupor or coma; No feeding; Shrill cry; Muscle rigidity, markedly arched back with neck hyperextended backwards; Seizures","Bilirubin encephalopathy (BE) is caused by very high levels of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is created as the body gets rid of old red blood cells. High levels of bilirubin in the body can cause the skin to look yellow (jaundice).; If the level of bilirubin is very high or a baby is very ill, the substance will move out of the blood and collect in the brain tissue if it is not bound to albumin (protein) in the blood. This can lead to problems such as brain damage and hearing loss. The term ""kernicterus"" refers to the yellow staining caused by bilirubin. This is seen in parts of the brain on autopsy.; This condition most often develops in the first week of life, but may be seen up until the third week. Some newborns with Rh hemolytic disease are at high risk for severe jaundice that can lead to this condition. Rarely, BE can develop in seemingly healthy babies."
007310,Tracheomalacia - acquired,Secondary tracheomalacia,"Symptoms of tracheomalacia include:; Breathing problems that get worse with coughing, crying, or upper respiratory infections, such as a cold; Breathing noises that may change when body position changes, and improve during sleep; High-pitched breathing; Rattling, noisy breaths",Acquired tracheomalacia is very uncommon at any age. It occurs when normal cartilage in the wall of the windpipe begins to break down.; This form of tracheomalacia may result:; When large blood vessels put pressure on the airway; As a complication after surgery to repair birth defects in the windpipe and esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach); After having a breathing tube or trachea tube (tracheostomy) for a long time

007312,Pneumothorax - infants,Pulmonary air leak; Pneumothorax - neonatal,"Many infants with pneumothorax do not have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can include:; Bluish skin color (cyanosis); Fast breathing; Flaring of the nostrils; Grunting with breathing; Irritability; Restlessness; Use of additional chest and abdominal muscles to aid breathing (retractions)","A pneumothorax occurs when some of the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in a baby's lung become overinflated and burst. This causes air to leak into the space between the lung and chest wall (pleural space).; The most common cause of pneumothorax is respiratory distress syndrome. This is a condition that occurs in babies who are born too early (premature).; Meconium aspiration syndrome is another cause of pneumothorax in newborns.; Other causes include pneumonia (infection of the lung) or underdeveloped lung tissue.; Less commonly, otherwise healthy infants can develop an air leak when they take the first few breaths after birth. This occurs because of the pressure needed to expand the lungs for the first time. There may be genetic factors which contribute to this problem.; The baby's lungs lack the slippery substance (surfactant) that helps them stay open (inflated). Therefore, the tiny air sacs are not able to expand as easily.; If the baby needs a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator), extra pressure on the baby's lungs, from the machine can sometimes burst the air sacs.; Before or during birth, the baby may breathe in the first bowel movement, called meconium. This may obstruct the airways and cause breathing problems."
007313,Neonatal abstinence syndrome,NAS; Neonatal abstinence symptoms; NOWS; Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome,"The symptoms of NAS depend on:; Symptoms often begin within 1 to 3 days after birth, but may take up to a week to appear. Because of this, the baby will most often need to stay in the hospital for observation and monitoring for up to a week.; Symptoms may include:; The type of drug the mother used; How the body breaks down and clears the drug (influenced by genetic factors); How much of the drug she was taking; How long she used the drug; Whether the baby was born full-term or early (premature); Blotchy skin coloring (mottling); Diarrhea; Excessive crying or high-pitched crying; Excessive sucking; Fever; Hyperactive reflexes; Increased muscle tone; Irritability; Poor feeding; Rapid breathing; Seizures; Sleep problems; Slow weight gain; Stuffy nose, sneezing; Sweating; Trembling (tremors); Vomiting","NAS may occur when a pregnant woman takes drugs such as heroin, or medicines such as codeine, oxycodone (Oxycontin), methadone, or buprenorphine.; These and other substances pass through the placenta that connects the baby to its mother in the womb. The baby becomes dependent on the drug along with the mother.; If the mother continues to use the drugs within the week or so before delivery, the baby will be dependent on the drug at birth. Because the baby is no longer getting the drug after birth, withdrawal symptoms may occur as the drug is slowly cleared from the baby's system.; Withdrawal symptoms also may occur in babies exposed to alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and certain antidepressants (SSRIs) while in the womb.; Babies of mothers who use opioids and other addictive drugs (nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, alcohol) may have long-term problems. While there is no clear evidence of a NAS for other drugs, they may contribute to the severity of a baby's NAS symptoms."
007314,Absent pulmonary valve,Absent pulmonary valve syndrome; Congenital absence of the pulmonary valve; Pulmonary valve agenesis; Cyanotic heart disease - pulmonary valve; Congenital heart disease - pulmonary valve; Birth defect heart - pulmonary valve,"Symptoms can vary depending on which other defects the infant has, but may include:; Blue coloring to the skin (cyanosis); Coughing; Failure to thrive; Poor appetite; Rapid breathing; Respiratory failure; Wheezing","Absent pulmonary valve occurs when the pulmonary valve does not form or develop properly while the baby is in the mother's womb. When present, it often occurs as part of a heart condition called tetralogy of Fallot. It is found in about 3% to 6% of people who have tetralogy of Fallot.; When the pulmonary valve is missing or does not work well, blood does not flow efficiently to the lungs to get enough oxygen.; In most cases, there is also a hole between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect). This defect will also lead to low-oxygen blood being pumped out to the body.; The skin will have a blue appearance (cyanosis), because the body's blood contains a low amount of oxygen.; Absent pulmonary valve also results in very enlarged (dilated) branch pulmonary arteries (the arteries that carry blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen). They can become so enlarged that they press on the tubes that bring the oxygen into the lungs (bronchi). This causes breathing problems.; Other heart defects that can occur with absent pulmonary valve include:; Heart problems that occur with absent pulmonary valve may be due to defects in certain genes.; Abnormal tricuspid valve; Atrial septal defect; Double outlet right ventricle; Ductus arteriosis; Endocardial cushion defect; Marfan syndrome; Tricuspid atresia; Absent left pulmonary artery"
007315,Coronary artery fistula,Congenital heart defect - coronary artery fistula; Birth defect heart - coronary artery fistula,"Infants with this condition often do not have any symptoms.; If symptoms do occur, they can include:; Heart murmur; Chest discomfort or pain; Easy fatigue; Failure to thrive; Fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations); Shortness of breath (dyspnea)","A coronary artery fistula is often congenital, meaning that it is present at birth. It generally occurs when one of the coronary arteries fails to form properly. This most often takes place when the baby is developing in the womb. The coronary artery abnormally attaches to one of the chambers of the heart (the atrium or ventricle) or another blood vessel (for example, the pulmonary artery).; A coronary artery fistula can also develop after birth. It may be caused by:; Coronary artery fistula is a rare condition. Infants who are born with it sometimes also have other heart defects. These may include:; An infection that weakens the wall of the coronary artery and the heart; Certain types of heart surgery; Injury to the heart from an accident or surgery; Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS); Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum"
007316,Double aortic arch,Aortic arch anomaly; Double arch; Congenital heart defect - double aortic arch; Birth defect heart - double aortic arch,"Because symptoms of double aortic arch are often mild, the problem may not be discovered until the child is a few years old.; The double aortic arch may press on the trachea and esophagus, leading to trouble breathing and swallowing. The severity of the symptoms depends on how much the aortic arch is pressing on these structures.; Breathing symptoms include:; Digestive symptoms may include:; High-pitched sound during breathing (stridor); Noisy breathing; Repeated pneumonias; Wheezing; Choking; Difficulty eating and swallowing; Vomiting","Double aortic arch is a common form of a group of defects that affect the development of the aorta in the womb. These defects cause an abnormal formation called a vascular ring (a circle of blood vessels).; Normally, the aorta develops from one of several curved pieces of tissue (arches). As babies develop in the womb, the arches split into several parts. The body breaks down some of the arches, while others form into arteries. A normally developed aorta is a single arch that leaves the heart and moves leftward.; In double aortic arch, some of the arches that should have disappeared are still present at birth in addition to the normal arch. Babies with a double aortic arch have an aorta that is made up of two vessels instead of one. The two parts to the aorta have smaller arteries branching off of them. As a result, the two branches go around and press down on the windpipe and the tube (esophagus) that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.; A double aortic arch may occur in other congenital heart defects, including:; Double aortic arch is very rare. Vascular rings make up a small percentage of all congenital heart problems. Of these, a little more than half are caused by double aortic arch. The condition occurs equally in males and females. It is often present in people with certain chromosome abnormalities.; Tetralogy of Fallot; Truncus arteriosus; Transposition of the great arteries; Ventricular septal defect"
007317,Eisenmenger syndrome,Eisenmenger complex; Eisenmenger disease; Eisenmenger reaction; Eisenmenger physiology; Congenital heart defect - Eisenmenger; Cyanotic heart disease - Eisenmenger; Birth defect heart - Eisenmenger; Eisenmenger's syndrome,"Symptoms include:; Bluish lips, fingers, toes, and skin (cyanosis); Rounded fingernails and toenails (clubbing); Numbness and tingling of fingers and toes; Chest pain; Coughing up blood; Dizziness; Fainting; Feeling tired; Shortness of breath; Skipped heartbeats (palpitations); Stroke; Swelling in the joints caused by too much uric acid (gout)","Eisenmenger syndrome is a condition that results from abnormal blood circulation caused by a defect in the heart. Most often, people with this condition are born with a hole between the two larger pumping chambers -- the left and right ventricles -- of the heart (ventricular septal defect). The hole allows blood that has already picked up oxygen from the lungs to flow back into the lungs, instead of going out to the rest of the body.; Other heart defects that can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome include:; Over many years, increased blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs. As a result, the blood flow goes backward through the hole between the two pumping chambers. This allows oxygen-poor blood to travel to the rest of the body.; Eisenmenger syndrome may begin to develop before a child reaches puberty. However, it also can develop in young adulthood, and may progress throughout young adulthood.; Atrioventricular canal defect; Atrial septal defect; Cyanotic heart disease; Patent ductus arteriosus; Truncus arteriosus"
007318,Vascular ring,Right aortic arch with aberrant subclavian and left ligamentum arteriosus; Congenital heart defect - vascular ring; Birth defect heart - vascular ring,"Some children with a vascular ring never develop symptoms. However, in most cases, symptoms are seen during infancy. Pressure on the windpipe (trachea) and esophagus can lead to breathing and digestive problems. The more the ring presses down, the more severe the symptoms will be.; Breathing problems may include:; Eating may make breathing symptoms worse.; Digestive symptoms are rare, but may include:; High-pitched cough; Loud breathing (stridor); Repeated pneumonias or respiratory infections; Respiratory distress; Wheezing; Choking; Difficulty eating solid foods; Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia); Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); Slow breast or bottle feeding; Vomiting","Vascular ring is rare. It accounts for less than 1% of all congenital heart problems. The condition occurs as often in males as females. Some infants with vascular ring also have another congenital heart problem.; Vascular ring occurs very early during the baby's development in the womb. Normally, the aorta develops from one of several curved pieces of tissue (arches). The body breaks down some of the remaining arches, while others form into arteries. Some arteries that should break down do not, which forms a vascular ring.; With vascular ring, some of the arches and vessels that should have changed into arteries or disappeared are still present when the baby is born. These arches form a ring of blood vessels, which encircles and presses down on the windpipe (trachea) and esophagus.; Several different types of vascular ring exist. In some types, the vascular ring only partially encircles the trachea and esophagus, but it still can cause symptoms."
007319,Aortopulmonary window,Aortopulmonary septal defect; Aortopulmonary fenestration; Congenital heart defect - aortopulmonary window; Birth defect heart - aortopulmonary window,"If the defect is small, it may not cause any symptoms. However, most defects are large.; Symptoms can include:; Delayed growth; Heart failure; Irritability; Poor eating and lack of weight gain; Rapid breathing; Rapid heartbeat; Respiratory infections","Normally, blood flows through the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Then the blood travels back to the heart and is pumped to the aorta and the rest of the body.; Babies with an aortopulmonary window have a hole in between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Because of this hole, blood from the aorta flows into the pulmonary artery, and as a result too much blood flows to the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs (a condition called pulmonary hypertension) and congestive heart failure. The bigger the defect, the more blood that is able to enter the pulmonary artery.; The condition occurs when the aorta and pulmonary artery do not divide normally as the baby develops in the womb.; Aortopulmonary window is very rare. It accounts for less than 1% of all congenital heart defects.; This condition can occur on its own or with other heart defects such as:; Fifty percent of people usually have no other heart defects.; Tetralogy of Fallot; Pulmonary atresia; Truncus arteriosus; Atrial septal defect; Patent ductus arteriosus; Interrupted aortic arch"
007320,Vitamin K deficiency bleeding of the newborn,Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN),Vitamin K deficiency causes bleeding. The most common areas of bleeding include:; There may also be:; At the site of circumcision; Belly button area; Gastrointestinal tract (resulting in blood in the baby's bowel movements); Mucous membranes (such as the lining of the nose and mouth); Places where there has been a needle stick; The brain; Blood in the urine; Bruising; Seizures (convulsions) or abnormal behavior due to bleeding inside the skull,"A lack of vitamin K may cause severe bleeding in newborn babies. Vitamin K plays an important role in blood clotting.; Babies often have a low level of vitamin K for a variety of reasons. Vitamin K does not move easily across the placenta from the mother to the baby. As a result, a newborn does not have much vitamin K stored up at birth. Also, the bacteria that help make vitamin K are not yet present in a newborn's gastrointestinal tract. Finally, there is not much vitamin K in mother's milk.; Your baby may develop this condition if:; The condition is grouped into three categories:; Anyone of any age with the following problems involving the gastrointestinal system is also at risk to develop this disorder:; A preventive vitamin K shot is not given at birth (if vitamin K is given by mouth instead of as a shot, it must be given more than once, and it does not appear to be as effective as the shot).; The mother takes certain anti-seizure or blood-thinning drugs.; Immediate-onset VKDB is very rare. It occurs within the first 48 hours after birth and is usually a result of anti-seizure medicines or some other medicines, including a blood thinner called warfarin (Coumadin), taken by mothers during pregnancy.; Early-onset (formerly called âclassic-onsetâ) disease is also rare. It occurs between 1 to 14 days after birth. It is usually seen in breastfed infants who did not receive a vitamin K shot.; Late-onset VKDB is seen in infants between 2 weeks and 6 months old. It is also more likely to happen in those who did not receive a vitamin K shot.; Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency; Biliary atresia or other cholestatic liver disease; Celiac disease; Cystic fibrosis or other causes of pancreatic insufficiency; Diarrhea (prolonged); Hepatitis; Inflammatory bowel disease"
007321,Ebstein anomaly,Ebstein's anomaly; Ebstein's malformation; Congenital heart defect - Ebstein; Birth defect heart - Ebstein; Cyanotic heart disease - Ebstein,"The abnormality can be slight or very severe. Therefore, the symptoms can also range from mild to very severe. Symptoms can develop soon after birth, and can include bluish-colored lips and nails due to low blood oxygen levels. In severe cases, the baby appears very sick and has trouble breathing. In mild cases, the affected person may be asymptomatic for many years, sometimes even permanently.; Symptoms in older children may include:; Cough; Failure to grow; Fatigue; Rapid breathing; Shortness of breath; Very fast heartbeat","The tricuspid valve is normally made of three parts, called leaflets or flaps. The leaflets open to allow blood to move from the right atrium (top chamber) to the right ventricle (bottom chamber) while the heart relaxes. They close to prevent blood from moving from the right ventricle to the right atrium while the heart pumps.; In people with Ebstein anomaly, the leaflets are placed deeper into the right ventricle instead of the normal position. The leaflets are often larger than normal. The defect most often causes the valve to work poorly, and blood may go the wrong way. Instead of flowing out to the lungs, the blood flows back into the right atrium. The backup of blood flow can lead to heart enlargement and fluid buildup in the body. There may also be narrowing of the valve that leads to the lungs (pulmonary valve).; In many cases, people also have a hole in the wall separating the heart's two upper chambers (atrial septal defect) and blood flow across this hole may cause oxygen-poor blood to go to the body. This can cause cyanosis, a blue tint to the skin caused by oxygen-poor blood.; Ebstein anomaly occurs as a baby develops in the womb. The exact cause is unknown. The use of certain drugs (such as lithium or benzodiazepines) during pregnancy may play a role. The condition is rare. It is more common in white people."
007322,Hearing loss - infants,Deafness - infants; Hearing impairment - infants; Conductive hearing loss - infants; Sensorineural hearing loss - infants; Central hearing loss - infants,"Signs of hearing loss in infants vary by age. For example:; Some children may not be diagnosed with hearing loss until they are in school. This is true even if they were born with hearing loss. Inattention and falling behind in class work may be signs of undiagnosed hearing loss.; A newborn baby with hearing loss may not startle when there is a loud noise nearby.; Older infants, who should respond to familiar voices, may show no reaction when spoken to.; Children should be using single words by 15 months, and simple 2-word sentences by age 2. If they do not reach these milestones, the cause may be hearing loss.","Although it is not common, some infants may have some hearing loss at birth. Hearing loss can also develop in children who had normal hearing as infants.; Risk factors for infant hearing loss include:; Hearing loss may occur when there is a problem in the outer or middle ear. These problems may slow or prevent sound waves from passing through. They include:; Another type of hearing loss is due to a problem with the inner ear. It may occur when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that move sound through the ear are damaged. This type of hearing loss can be caused by:; Central hearing loss results from damage to the auditory nerve itself, or the brain pathways that lead to the nerve. Central hearing loss is rare in infants and children.; The loss can occur in one or both ears. It may be mild, moderate, severe, or profound. Profound hearing loss is what most people call deafness.; Sometimes, hearing loss gets worse over time. Other times, it stays stable and does not get worse.; Family history of hearing loss; Low birth weight; Birth defects that cause changes in the structure of the ear canal or middle ear; Buildup of ear wax; Buildup of fluid behind the eardrum; Injury to or rupture of the eardrum; Objects stuck in the ear canal; Scar on the eardrum from many infections; Exposure to certain toxic chemicals or medicines while in the womb or after birth; Genetic disorders; Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb (such as toxoplasmosis, measles, or herpes); Infections that can damage the brain after birth, such as meningitis or measles; Problems with the structure of the inner ear; Tumors"
007323,Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery,Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery; ALCAPA; ALCAPA syndrome; Bland-White-Garland syndrome; Congenital heart defect - ALCAPA; Birth defect - ALCAPA,Symptoms of ALCAPA in an infant include:; Symptoms can appear within the first 2 months of the baby's life.; Crying or sweating during feeding; Irritability; Pale skin; Poor feeding; Rapid breathing; Symptoms of pain or distress in the baby (often mistaken for colic),"ALCAPA is a problem that occurs when the baby's heart is developing early in the pregnancy. The developing blood vessel does not attach correctly to the heart muscle.; In the normal heart, the LCA originates from the aorta. It supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart as well as the mitral valve (the heart valve between the upper and lower chambers of the heart on the left side). The aorta is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body.; In children with ALCAPA, the LCA originates from the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen.; When ALCAPA occurs, blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart. Therefore, the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. The tissue begins to die due to lack of oxygen. This can cause a heart attack in a baby.; A condition known as coronary steal further damages the heart in babies with ALCAPA. The low blood pressure in the pulmonary artery causes blood from the abnormally connected LCA to flow back toward the pulmonary artery instead of toward the heart muscle. This results in less blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. This problem can also lead to a heart attack in a baby. Coronary steal develops over time in babies with ALCAPA if the condition is not treated early."
007324,Endocardial cushion defect,Atrioventricular (AV) canal defect; Atrioventricular septal defect; AVSD; Common AV orifice; Ostium primum atrial septal defects; Congenital heart defect - ECD; Birth defect - ECD; Cyanotic disease - ECD,"Symptoms of ECD may include:; Tires easily; Bluish skin color, also known as cyanosis (the lips may also be blue); Feeding difficulties; Failure to gain weight and grow; Frequent pneumonia
   or infections; Pale skin (pallor); Rapid breathing; Rapid heartbeat; Sweating; Swollen legs or abdomen (rare in children); Trouble breathing, especially during feeding","ECD occurs while a baby is still growing in the womb (uterus). The endocardial cushions are two thicker areas that develop into the walls (septum) that divide the four chambers of the heart. They also form the mitral and tricuspid valves. These are the valves that separate the atria (top collecting chambers) from the ventricles (bottom pumping chambers).; The lack of separation between the two sides of the heart causes several problems:; There are two types of ECD:; ECD is strongly linked to Down syndrome. Several gene changes are also linked to ECD. However, the exact cause of ECD is unknown.; ECD may be associated with other congenital heart defects, such as:; Increased blood flow to the lungs. This results in increased pressure in the lungs. In ECD, blood flows through the abnormal openings from the left to the right side of the heart, then to the lungs. More blood flow into the lungs makes the blood pressure in the lungs rise.; Heart failure. The extra effort needed to pump makes the heart work harder than normal. The heart muscle may enlarge and weaken. This can cause swelling in the baby, problems in breathing, and difficulty in feeding and growing.; Cyanosis. As the blood pressure increases in the lungs, blood starts to flow from the right side of the heart to the left. The oxygen-poor blood mixes with the oxygen-rich blood. As a result, blood with less oxygen than usual is pumped out to the body. This causes cyanosis, or bluish skin.; Complete ECD. This condition involves an atrial septal defect (ASD) and a ventricular septal defect (VSD). People with a complete ECD have only one large heart valve (common AV valve) instead of two distinct valves (mitral and tricuspid).; Partial (or incomplete) ECD. In this condition, only an ASD, or an ASD and VSD are present. There are two distinct valves, but one of them (the mitral valve) is often abnormal with an opening (cleft) in it. This defect can leak blood back through the valve.; Double outlet right ventricle; Single ventricle; Transposition of the great vessels; Tetralogy of Fallot"
007325,Bicuspid aortic valve,Bicommissural aortic valve; Valvular disease - bicuspid aortic valve; BAV,"Most of the time, BAV is not diagnosed in infants or children because it causes no symptoms. However, the abnormal valve can leak or become narrow over time.; Symptoms of such complications may include:; If a baby has other congenital heart problems, they may cause symptoms that will lead to the discovery of a BAV.; Baby or child tires easily; Chest pain; Difficulty breathing; Rapid and irregular heartbeat (palpitations); Loss of consciousness (fainting); Pale skin (pallor)","The aortic valve allows oxygen-rich blood to flow from the heart to the aorta. It prevents the blood from flowing back from the aorta into the heart when the pumping chamber relaxes.; BAV is present at birth (congenital). An abnormal aortic valve develops during the early weeks of pregnancy, when the baby's heart is developing. The cause of this problem is unclear, but it is the most common congenital heart defect. BAV often runs in families.; A BAV may not be completely effective at stopping blood from leaking back into the heart. This leakage is called aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve may also become stiff and not open up. This is called aortic stenosis, which causes the heart to pump harder than usual to get blood through the valve. The aorta may become enlarged with this condition.; BAV is more common among males than females.; A BAV often exists in babies with coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the aorta). BAV is also seen in diseases in which there is a blockage to blood flow on the left side of the heart."
007326,Dextrocardia,Cyanotic heart defect - dextrocardia; Congenital heart defect - dextrocardia; Birth defect - dextrocardia,There are no symptoms of dextrocardia if the heart is normal.; Conditions that may include dextrocardia may cause the following symptoms:; Bluish skin (cyanosis); Difficulty breathing; Failure to grow and gain weight; Fatigue; Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice); Pale skin (pallor); Repeated sinus or lung infections,"During the early weeks of pregnancy, the baby's heart develops. Sometimes, it turns so that it points to the right side of the chest instead of the left side. The reasons for this are unclear.; There are several types of dextrocardia. Many types involve other defects of the heart and abdomen area.; In the simplest type of dextrocardia, the heart is a mirror image of the normal heart and there are no other problems. This condition is rare. When this occurs, the organs of the abdomen and the lungs will often also be arranged in a mirror image. For example, the liver will be on the left side instead of the right.; Some people with mirror-image dextrocardia have a problem with the fine hairs (cilia) that filter the air going into their nose and air passages. This condition is called Kartagener syndrome.; In the more common types of dextrocardia, other heart defects are also present. The most common of these include:; The abdominal and chest organs in babies with dextrocardia may be abnormal and may not work correctly. A very serious syndrome that appears with dextrocardia is called heterotaxy. In this condition, many of the organs are not in their usual places and may not work properly. For example, the spleen may be completely missing. The spleen is an important part of the immune system, so babies born without this organ are in danger of severe bacterial infections and death. In another form of heterotaxy, several small spleens exist, but they may not work correctly.; Heterotaxy may also include:; Possible risk factors for dextrocardia include a family history of the condition.; Double outlet right ventricle (the aorta connects to the right ventricle instead of to the left ventricle); Endocardial cushion defect (the walls separating all 4 chambers of the heart are poorly formed or absent); Pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve) or atresia (pulmonary valve does not form properly); Single ventricle (instead of two ventricles, there is a single ventricle); Transposition of the great vessels (the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched); Ventricular septal defect (hole in the wall that separates the right and left ventricles of the heart); Abnormal gallbladder system; Problems with the lungs; Problems with the structure or position of the intestines; Severe heart defects; Abnormalities of the blood vessels"
007327,Double inlet left ventricle,DILV; Single ventricle; Common ventricle; Univentricular heart; Univentricular heart of the left ventricular type; Congenital heart defect - DILV; Cyanotic heart defect - DILV; Birth defect - DILV,Symptoms of DILV may include:; Bluish color to the skin and lips (cyanosis) due to low oxygen in the blood; Failure to gain weight and grow; Pale skin (pallor); Poor feeding from becoming tired easily; Sweating; Swollen legs or abdomen; Trouble breathing,"DILV is one of several heart defects known as single (or common) ventricle defects. People with DILV have a large left ventricle and a small right ventricle. The left ventricle is the pumping chamber of the heart that sends oxygen-rich blood to the body. The right ventricle is the pumping chamber that sends oxygen-poor blood to the lungs.; In the normal heart, the right and left ventricles receive blood from the right and left atria. The atria are upper chambers of the heart. Oxygen-poor blood returning from the body flows to the right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle then pumps blood to the pulmonary artery. This is the blood vessel that carries blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen.; Blood with fresh oxygen returns to the left atrium and left ventricle. The aorta then carries oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body from the left ventricle. The aorta is the major artery leading out of the heart.; In people with DILV, only the left ventricle is developed. Both atria empty blood into this ventricle. This means that oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. The mixture is then pumped to both the body and the lungs.; DILV can happen if the large blood vessels arising from the heart are in the wrong positions. The aorta arises from the small right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. It can also occur when the arteries are in normal positions and arise from the usual ventricles. In this case, blood flows from the left to right ventricle through a hole between the chambers called a ventricular septal defect (VSD).; DILV is very rare. The exact cause is unknown. The problem most likely occurs early in the pregnancy, when the baby's heart develops. People with DILV often also have other heart problems, such as:; Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the aorta); Pulmonary atresia (pulmonary valve of the heart is not formed properly); Pulmonary valve stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve)"
007328,Double outlet right ventricle,DORV; Taussig-Bing anomaly; DORV with doubly-committed VSD; DORV with noncommitted VSD; DORV with subaortic VSD; Congenital heart defect - DORV; Cyanotic heart defect - DORV; Birth defect - DORV,Signs of DORV may include:; Symptoms of DORV may include:; Enlarged heart; Heart murmur; Rapid breathing; Rapid heartbeat; Poor feeding from becoming tired easily; Bluish color of the skin and lips (cyanosis); Clubbing (thickening of the nail beds) of toes and fingers (late sign); Failure to gain weight and grow; Pale coloring (pallor); Sweating; Swollen legs or abdomen; Trouble breathing,"In a normal heart structure, the aorta connects to the LV. The pulmonary artery normally is connected to the RV. In DORV, both arteries flow out of the RV. This is a problem because the RV pumps oxygen-poor blood. This blood is then circulated throughout the body.; Another defect called a ventricular septal defect (VSD) always occurs with DORV.; Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs flows from the left side of the heart, through the VSD opening and into the RV. This helps the infant with DORV by allowing oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood. Even with this mixture, the body may not get enough oxygen. This makes the heart work harder to meet the body's needs. There are several types of DORV.; The difference between these types is the location of the VSD as it relates to the location of the pulmonary artery and aorta. The symptoms and severity of the problem will depend on the type of DORV. The presence of pulmonary valve stenosis also affects the condition.; People with DORV often have other heart defects, such as:; Endocardial cushion defects (the walls separating all four chambers of the heart are poorly formed or absent); Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the aorta); Mitral valve problems; Pulmonary atresia (pulmonary valve does not form properly); Pulmonary valve stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve); Right-sided aortic arch (aortic arch is on right instead of the left); Transposition of the great arteries (the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched)"
007329,High blood pressure in infants,Hypertension - infants,"Most babies with high blood pressure will not have symptoms. Instead, symptoms may be related to the condition causing the high blood pressure. These symptoms may include:; Symptoms that may appear if the baby has very high blood pressure include:; Bluish skin (cyanosis); Failure to grow and gain weight; Frequent urinary tract infections; Pale skin (pallor); Rapid breathing; Irritability; Seizures; Trouble breathing; Vomiting","Blood pressure measures how hard the heart is working, and how healthy the arteries are. There are two numbers in each blood pressure measurement:; Blood pressure measurements are written this way: 120/80. One or both of these numbers can be too high.; Several factors affect blood pressure, including:; High blood pressure in infants may be due to kidney or heart disease that is present at birth (congenital). Common examples include:; In newborn babies, high blood pressure is often caused by a blood clot in a kidney blood vessel, a complication of having an umbilical artery catheter.; Other causes of high blood pressure in infants may include:; Blood pressure rises as the baby grows. The average blood pressure in a newborn is 64/41. The average blood pressure in a child 1 month through 2 years old is 95/58. It is normal for these numbers to vary.; The first (top) number is the systolic blood pressure, which measures the force of blood released when the heart beats.; The second (bottom) number is the diastolic pressure, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest.; Hormones; The health of the heart and blood vessels; The health of the kidneys; Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the large blood vessel of the heart called the aorta); Patent ductus arteriosus (blood vessel between the aorta and pulmonary artery that should close after birth, but remains open); Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (lung condition that affects newborn babies who were either put on a breathing machine after birth or were born very early); Kidney disease; Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the major blood vessel of the kidney); Certain medicines; Exposure to illegal drugs such as cocaine; Certain tumors; Inherited conditions (problems that run in families); Thyroid problems"
007330,Retinal vein occlusion,Central retinal vein occlusion; CRVO; Branch retinal vein occlusion; BRVO; Vision loss - retinal vein occlusion; Blurry vision - retinal vein occlusion,Symptoms include sudden blurring or vision loss in all or part of one eye.,"Retinal vein occlusion is most often caused by hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and the formation of a blood clot.; Blockage of smaller veins (branch veins or BRVO) in the retina often occurs in places where retinal arteries that have been thickened or hardened by atherosclerosis cross over and place pressure on a retinal vein.; Risk factors for retinal vein occlusion include:; The risk of these disorders increases with age, therefore retinal vein occlusion most often affects older people.; Blockage of retinal veins may cause other eye problems, including:; Atherosclerosis; Diabetes; High blood pressure (hypertension); Other eye conditions, such as glaucoma, macular edema, or vitreous hemorrhage; Glaucoma (high pressure in the eye), caused by new, abnormal blood vessels growing in the front part of the eye; Macular edema, caused by the leakage of fluid in the retina"

Almost everyone has back pain at some time in their life. Often, the exact cause of the pain cannot be found.; A single event may not have caused your pain. You may have been doing many activities, such as lifting the wrong way, for a long time. Then suddenly, one simple movement, such as reaching for something or bending from your waist, leads to pain.; Many people with chronic back pain have arthritis. Or they may have extra wear and tear of the spine, which may be due to:; You may have had a herniated disk, in which part of the spinal disk pushed onto nearby nerves. Normally, the disks provide space and cushion in your spine. If these disks dry out and become thinner and more brittle, you can lose movement in the spine over time.; If the spaces between the spinal nerves and spinal cord become narrowed, this can lead to spinal stenosis. These problems are called degenerative joint or spine disease.; Other possible causes of chronic low back pain include:; You are at greater risk for low back pain if you:; Heavy use from work or sports; Injuries or fractures; Surgery; Curvature of the spine, such as scoliosis or kyphosis; Medical problems, such as fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis; Piriformis syndrome, a pain disorder involving a muscle in the buttocks called the piriformis muscle; Are over age 30; Are overweight; Are pregnant; Do not exercise; Feel stressed or depressed; Have a job in which you have to do heavy lifting, bending and twisting, or that involves whole body vibration, such as truck driving or using a sandblaster; Smoke"

007508,Obesity in children,Obese - children,,"When children eat more food than their bodies need for normal growth and activity, the extra calories are stored in fat cells for later use. If this pattern continues over time, they develop more fat cells and may develop obesity.; Normally, infants and young children respond to signals of hunger and fullness so that they do not consume more calories than their bodies need. However, changes over the last few decades in lifestyle and food choices have led to the rise of obesity among children.; Children are surrounded by many things that make it easy to overeat and harder to be active. Foods that are high in fat and sugar content often come in large portion sizes. These factors can lead children to take in more calories than they need before they feel full. TV commercials and other screen ads can lead to unhealthy food choices. Most of the time, the food in ads aimed at children is high in sugar, salt, or fats.; ""Screen time"" activities such as watching television, gaming, texting, and playing on the computer require very little energy. They often take the place of healthy physical exercise. Also, children tend to crave unhealthy snack foods they see in TV ads.; Other factors in the child's environment can also lead to obesity. Family, friends, and school setting help shape a child's diet and exercise choices. Food may be used as a reward or to comfort a child. These learned habits can lead to overeating. Many people have a hard time breaking these habits later in life.; Genetics, medical conditions, and emotional disorders can also increase a child's risk for obesity. Hormone disorders or low thyroid function, and certain medicines, such as steroids or anti-seizure medicines, can increase a child's appetite. Over time, this increases their risk for obesity.; An unhealthy focus on eating, weight, and body image can lead to an eating disorder. Obesity and eating disorders often occur at the same time in teenage girls and young adult women who may be unhappy with their body image."

These include:; There are many nerves that help the muscles of the mouth, throat, and esophagus work together. Much of swallowing occurs without you being aware of what you are doing.; Swallowing is a complex act.

In some cases, the condition can be difficult to diagnose and may not be found during an office visit. However, rib fractures are common and can be seen on x-rays.; An eye doctor may find bleeding behind the baby's eye or retinal detachment. There are, however, other causes of bleeding behind the eye and they should be ruled out before diagnosing shaken baby syndrome. Other factors must be considered.; Convulsions (seizures); Decreased alertness; Extreme irritability or other changes in behavior; Lethargy, sleepiness, not smiling; Loss of consciousness; Loss of vision; No breathing; Pale or bluish skin; Poor feeding, lack of appetite; Vomiting","Most cases are due to an angry parent or caregiver shaking the baby to punish or quiet it. Such shaking most often takes place when the infant is crying inconsolably and the frustrated caregiver loses control. Many times the caregiver did not intend to harm the baby. Still, it is a form of child abuse.; Injuries are most likely to happen when the baby is shaken and then the baby's head hits something. Even hitting a soft object, such as a mattress or pillow, may be enough to injure newborns and small infants. Children's brains are softer, their neck muscles and ligaments are weak, and their heads are large and heavy in proportion to their bodies. The result is a type of whiplash, similar to what occurs in some auto accidents.; Shaken baby syndrome does not result from gentle bouncing, playful swinging or tossing the child in the air, or jogging with the child. It also is very unlikely to occur from accidents such as falling off chairs or down stairs, or accidentally being dropped from a caregiver's arms. Short falls may cause other types of head injuries, although these are often minor."

While most germs are harmless, some can cause infection.; Thrush occurs when too much of a yeast (a type of fungus) called Candida albicans grows in a baby's mouth. Germs called bacteria and fungi naturally grow in our bodies. Our immune system helps keep these germs in check. But babies do not have fully-formed immune systems. That makes it easier for too much yeast to grow.; Thrush often occurs when mother or baby has taken antibiotics. Antibiotics treat infections from bacteria. They can also kill good bacteria, and this allows yeast to grow.; The yeast thrives in warm, moist areas.

Children receive one from each parent. In most cases, both genes are active. This means information from both genes is used by the cells. With the UBE3A gene, both parents pass it on, but only the gene passed on from the mother is active.; Angelman syndrome most often occurs because the UBE3A gene passed on from the mother doesn't work the way it should. In some cases, AS is caused when two copies of the UBE3A gene come from the father, and none come from the mother. This means neither gene is active, because they both come from the father."

The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.; A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause. During periods of rapid growth, even more iron is needed.; Babies are born with iron stored in their bodies. Because they grow rapidly, infants and toddlers need to absorb a lot of iron each day. Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old.; Breastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk. Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron.; Infants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia. Cow's milk leads to anemia because it:; Children older than 12 months who drink too much cow's milk may also have anemia if they do not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.; Has less iron; Causes small amounts of blood loss from the intestines; Makes it harder for the body to absorb iron"

This can happen without any cause or as a result of another condition.; Heart block -- This occurs when the electrical signal is slowed or stopped as it moves through the heart.; Coronary heart disease (CHD) -- CHD can clog the arteries in your heart, so the blood cannot flow smoothly. Over time, this can put a strain on your heart's muscle and electrical system.; Heart attack -- A prior heart attack can create scar tissue that can lead to VF and cardiac arrest.; Heart problems, such as congenital heart disease, heart valve problems, heart rhythm problems, and an enlarged heart can also lead to cardiac arrest.; Abnormal levels of potassium or magnesium -- These minerals help your heart's electrical system work. Abnormally high or low levels can cause cardiac arrest.; Severe physical stress -- Anything that causes a severe stress on your body can lead to cardiac arrest. This can include trauma, electrical shock, or major blood loss.; Recreational drugs -- Using certain drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, also increases your risk for cardiac arrest.; Medicines -- Some medicines can increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms."

007742,Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum,Necrobiosis lipoidica; NLD; Diabetes - necrobiosis,"A skin lesion is an area of skin that is different from the skin around it. With NLD, skin lesions start as firm, smooth, red bumps (papules) on the shins and lower part of the legs. They usually appear in the same areas on opposite sides of the body. They are painless in the early stage.; As the papules become bigger, they flatten. They develop a shiny yellow brown center with raised red to purplish edges. Veins are visible below the yellow part of the lesions. The lesions are irregularly round or oval with well-defined borders. They can spread and join together to give the appearance of a patch.; Lesions can also occur on the forearms. Rarely, they may occur on the stomach, face, scalp, palms, and soles of the feet.; Trauma may cause the lesions to develop ulcers. Nodules also may develop. The area may become very itchy and painful.; NLD is different from ulcers that can occur on the feet or ankles in people with diabetes.",The cause of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is unknown. It is thought to be linked to blood vessel inflammation related to autoimmune factors. This damages proteins in the skin (collagen).; People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to get NLD than those with type 2 diabetes. Women are more affected than men. Smoking increases the risk for NLD. Less than one half of one percent of those with diabetes suffer from this problem.

This occurs when the bones in middle of the foot collapse. This causes the arch of the foot to collapse and bow downward.; The toes may curl downward.; Because the feet are numb, these sores and ulcers may grow wider or deeper before they are noticed.; High blood sugar also makes it hard for the body to fight infection. As a result, these foot ulcers may become infected.","Charcot foot is a rare and disabling disorder. It is a result of nerve damage to the feet. A common cause is peripheral neuropathy.; Diabetes is the most common cause of this type of nerve damage. This damage is more common in people with type 1 diabetes. When blood sugar levels are high over a long time, both nerve and blood vessel damage occurs in the arms and legs.; Nerve damage makes it harder to notice the amount of pressure on the foot or if it is being stressed. The result is ongoing small injuries to the bones and ligaments that support the foot.; Other factors leading to foot damage include:; You may develop bone stress fractures in your feet, yet never know it.; Continuing to walk on the fractured bone often leads to further bone and joint damage.; Blood vessel damage from diabetes can increase or change blood flow to the feet. This can lead to bone loss. Weakened bones in the feet increase the risk of fracture.; Injury to the foot signals the body to produce more inflammation-causing chemicals. This contributes to swelling and bone loss."
